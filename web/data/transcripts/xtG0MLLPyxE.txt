Resolution creating a joint study committee on airport infrastructure and improvements.
This resolution I have been referred to the committee on transportation, that committee
recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes the chair of the House Transportation Committee, Chairman Jasper's to present
the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members.
I bring for you a joint study committee on airport infrastructure and improvements.
I think everyone in this room knows airports are important to the growth of our state and
a continued growth of commerce.
We need a comprehensive strategic plan to help develop infrastructure and remain a leader
in the sector.
You know, it's got four members of the Senate and four members of the House.
I want to point to you one interesting little way that this was determined.
When you two people from industry that the house, the speaker is going to point and two from LG.
What we did in this is we said they would come from tier one and tier four and tier two
and tier three counties for the different ones.
So that will make sure we're getting a broad look at the state of Georgia.
Now things very well thought out and I look forward to you supporting.
If there's any questions, Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to answer them.
You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. He waves. No questions
Thank you look for you by both consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this

all members voted and all members voted. The clerk will lock the machines on the passage
of Senate Resolution 84. The eyes are 156. The nays are A. This resolution having received
The requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 144.
Senate Bill 144 by Senator Tipkins,
the 37th Cooch of the 51st cows of the 46th and others.
We entitled an act to amend part one of Article one of chapter three,
title eight of the EFISCO to Georgia,
annotated really in the general provisions for housing authorities.
So it's to limit the ability of city housing authorities to operate.
to operate outside municipal boundaries without authorization.
This bill ever for the committee on governmental affairs,
that committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee, rules committee substitute.
Chair recognizes a representative air heart
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I bring for your consideration,
Senate Bill 144.
Senate Bill 144 changes the definition of the area
of operation for a housing authority of a city.
Currently in code of city authorities,
housing authorities area of operation includes
the city limits of that municipality
plus 10 miles beyond those city limits.
What SB 144 does is remove that clause,
10 miles beyond the city limits
and requires housing authorities to get the approval
of the governing body of the area
in which they are looking to do the housing development
the housing project. I will note that any housing projects that are currently in operation
within that 10-mile boundary outside the city limits can continue to operate. Essentially
what we're saying is we want the areas outside those municipalities to have some say in
the development that goes on. Mostly this includes or involves the unincorporated portions
of our county. We had a situation in Cobb County where the Marietta Housing Authority
went outside the city limits, built a development that was not compliant, was zoning, and did
so without the consent of the county commission. So, anyway, this is just kind of cleaning
that up, making sure that there is some accountability here and that the communities that are affected
by these developments at least have some say so in what is being developed
there. Mr. Speaker I'll yield for any questions.
You have some questions if you care to yield. I will. Chair recognizes Chairman Todd Jones
in room 341 for a question. Does a lady yield? I do.
Just for clarification, can the city remain in an unincorporated part of a county without
the county's approval?
Can the city remain?
Or can the housing authority remain?
I apologize.
Can the housing authority remain in the unincorporated part of a county without the county's approval?
My understanding is that the housing authority exists within the city.
was within the city's city limits, the housing authority can pretty much do what they want,
although it is the city governing body can determine whether or not they want that
housing authority to abide by zoning or to abide by land use.
So it can continue to exist, but if they want to build outside of the perimeter, outside
the city limits, they would have to do so only with the approval of the governing body.
Does that answer your question?
Do you further yield?
Yes.
Chair recognizes representative Eric Atomis to your left for a question.
Does the general allow you?
Yes.
Can you define a housing project?
Well, it would be a development under the administration of the housing authority.
Typically they are built and constructed in areas where there is a need indicated.
In fact, if you look in SB 144, let me find, it says here, provided that a resolution
show had been adopted by the governing body are there such declaring that there is a need
for the city housing authority to exercise its powers within the territorial boundaries
of said other city.
So there is typically sort of an assessment process that's gone through there, typically
with the housing authority to determine that there actually is a need that exists for
that development.
Thank you. Does a general lady further you? Yes. Have you ever visited a housing
project before? I have. Where? I've visited them in Cobb County. I've done in
fact even as a as a young person in my youth group we used to do all sorts of
projects and visitations and housing projects near so yes I have had the
opportunity to visit housing projects. Thank you. If there are no further questions
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well lady is yielded the well chair recognizes the
House minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson to speak to the bill
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to come to the well today in support of Senate Bill 144
This is about local control. We have had some issues in different areas where the housing authority did not believe
They need to comply with local zoning and so our county commissioners were
Not able to to participate in the process so all this bill does is say that if a housing authority once it goes out of there
There are city boundaries. They have to get an annual government agreement with that local
Unincorporated area. So it's a it's a very good bill and I'll be having to answer any questions
I'm very familiar with the area because I know my district is next to
Representative to Senator Tipton's district as well and and representative airheart and and it was
Kind of surprising to see a five-story building pop-up without any input at all from the community
But if there are any questions, I'll take them if not I'll yield a well. You have a question if you care to yield
Yes, I will take that chair recognizes representative cannon to your left for a question
Thank you. Hi there, mr. Web do you I do the question is it's been referenced local matters on this bill and so
So why are we debating this for the entire state of Georgia if we've only discussed it
for one county?
That's an excellent point.
So really it sparked from the one county because I don't think every housing authority is
doing this.
It was back in the 40s I want to say when these bills came around and back then the one
main city would be able to develop in the whole county and as time went on that one
city in this case thought that they should still be developing for the whole county.
So if they were to go into, say, Kennesaw, they would get an intergovernmental agreement.
The problem is that they're coming into other parts of the county without actually working
with those commissioners to do it.
So it would apply to the whole state because it is not just a local legislation, but it
would impact any city housing authority that wants to work in the county.
They would have to work with those commissioners to make sure that they were building what
they deemed the necessary housing.
To make sure that we do have the ability to have affordable housing spread throughout
the county and not just in one area and with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the
well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair
here's none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to
adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules the chair here's
none the rules committee substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of
the bill. The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to
shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will
vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines.
If all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on
the passage of Senate Bill 144.
The eyes are 145.
The nays are 23.
This bill, having received the requisite constitutional
majority, is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 95.
Senate Bill 95 by Senator again to the 47th beech of the 21st Alvers of the 56th
Senate of Barthay of the 31st and others. Meantado and act to amend
Title 50 that Fisher go to Georgia and Ted overlaid state government. So it's
to provide conditions for meetings and public hearings to be held by
teleconference and emergency conditions. This bill I refer to the committee on
government affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee
rules substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the
Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I bring to you
today Senate Bill 95 and this is a bill that I had borrowed from my good friend
Senator again to use as a writer for the co-am upgrade bill. Section one
deals with his original language which we didn't mean much because we've already
passed it in a proper form by Chairman Lundston's bill. So at some point Section 1 will disappear
that was on the teleconferencing. But the meat of this gets into Section 2. And we have
downgraded it considerably, but we still left a lot of the criteria in there for controlling
and to be sure that things are done right in the co-am industry. Section 2 deals with adding
to additional individuals to the lottery board.
The governor will add a new person who will have experience
in the co-am industry.
And also the board chairman of the co-am advisory board
will be put on that board.
Now that rotates off every year.
Section three is creates a working rule
that non-cash redemptions that if it's
legal to purchase and is legal to redeem for.
And it can't be exchanged for any cash or currency or anything like that.
It also establishes the gift cards.
Section 3 further says it puts a $50 cap on the class A machines on the gifts that are
in those or the prizes in those.
Section 4, it was that specific information that retail owners get licensed that they'll
have to provide to be sure they're on the straight up and up.
And also for the masters, they also have to provide certain other basic information
and certain financial information to ensure they're in compliance with the existing law.
The COM section will also does one thing, it's of major importance, it puts a COM division
of the Georgia Lottery, they'll be subject to the Georgia Administrative Procedures Act.
Section 5, as it creates a 50-50 reel, this in effect, that will be done on a quarterly
basis instead of a monthly basis and also does a carve out for the charitable organizations
from the 5050 rule that they've got to have been a 501c3 for at least 10 years and this
would be a charitable group such as the American Legion, VFW, or some of those type organizations.
And then last but not least, the master license holders.
As I told you, I went about this bill before, one of the things that we've been picking
at the years is to put these gift cards into effect because that's the one thing that
takes any input or any rationale for folks who might be willing to trade out winnings
for these game machines for cash. If we go to the gift cards, that takes care of that.
So in replacement for doing the gift cards, the CoM master license holders have agreed
to pay an extra 1% of their proceeds to the lottery.
So that means it's starting in July 22 when the gift cards get fully implemented, where
they're paying 5% now in the retailer pays 5, then the master license holder will pay
6% to the Georgia lottery.
If I hope y'all remember the numbers that I'd given last time was that this raises a tremendous
amount of money and it's the fastest-growing revenue source for the lottery at this time.
Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to answer any questions and I would appreciate your favorable consideration.
Did you yield for questions?
I will.
Okay, you've got some.
Chair recognizes Chairman Houston, do you arrive for a question?
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to see where in here it said you named two members to the lottery board
and I misunderstood you.
He didn't misunderstand.
If you look on page three, if you look on line 49 through 51, 49 to 51, I was just
saying that.
Line 49-51.
The governor needs right now you have a chairperson of the Co-Am advisory board at the lottery.
it would elevate that chair person up to the board,
but the governor gets to nominate or gets to add
one more member to the lottery commission.
What, can I ask one more question?
What percentage of the, is it the percentage
of the gross price that go to the lottery
or how is that determined?
And back over the history of this industry
and because of various and troubles and as it progressed,
these all these machines are hooked up to the lottery commission through the
terminals. So the any money that goes in that on that growth that the lottery
commission gets 10% right now, 5% from the retailer, 5% from the masterholder,
soon to be 6%, not included in additional 7% taxes.
But that's 5% or 5% of what, of the gross national product,
I mean, the profits of the clear of what they clear
on these machines, yes.
Not what about the payout?
Payout's is taken off and then the profit.
So we get 10%.
They get the state, the lottery gets 10% right now
of what's cleared.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You further yield?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans
in the gallery to your left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Chairman, isn't it true that I appreciate
that you and others worked really hard to add
the extra percent to be paid to the lottery
for education fund?
I hope you're grateful and I appreciate your help.
Will you further yield?
I will.
Isn't it also true that you and I agree
that these gift cards should help us
clean up the paying of cash in the industry.
You're absolutely right.
Even though these gift cards is predicted
that they'll bring in more revenue
because it will make it a more legitimate industry,
but that is the number one issue I'd said it last time,
and I'll say it now again,
that if a licensed game machine person,
whether it's in retail or otherwise,
if they have the ability to do gift cards,
they would absolutely be too stupid to breathe if they pay it out cash because the
paying out of cash and being caught is a death knail to that business and it
subjects them to criminal prosecution and a lifetime ban from the lottery or
anything else. Will you yield for one more? Yes ma'am. Are you and I on the same
page that if this gift card edition is as lucrative for the industry as we all
think it will be that we will be back here very soon asking for a higher
percentage for the lottery for education fund. You know I can't answer that
question. I know that a lot of the liberals in here they want to pick the
bones of anything they can. For the kids thank you. Thank you.
Do you further yield? Yes sir maybe one or two more maybe one with big
better. Yes sir. Do you recognize this chairman Oliver? To your left for a question.
Does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Is it? May I hope that you and I are on the same page about the
lottery boards refusal to release reserves in a reasonable way? This bill doesn't direct the lottery
board to release it's 400% of reserves doesn't? No ma'am. Are you and I on the same page that the
the lottery board needs to release more of these reserves?
You know, I have no idea we're on the same page
on very many things.
But on this particular issue, don't you think
that the lottery board's refusal to release money
for the lottery, from the lottery,
to pay for hope in pre-K is the bad decisions?
I can look through this bill,
but I don't believe that's in this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate
a favorable consideration for the members of this House and this move this along so that
we can raise more money for the lottery and create a more secured environment around
the people doing business. Thank you.

reconsidered its action. That bill will now go back to the general calendar.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 92.
Senate Bill 92 by Senator Robertson of the 29th Anderson of the 24th Alvers of the 56th
Mulles of the 53rd and Paine of the 54th, and the title of the act to amend Part 1 of
Article 2 of Chapter 13 to Title 16, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating schedules, offenses,
and penalties regarding the regulation of controlled substances.
Let's bill I refer to the committee on judiciary non-civilic committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute
Chair recognizes chairman Allen Powell to present the bill
Thank you, mr. Speaker and let me hope I'm a little bit better explaining this bill
Well, Senate Bill 92, we had dealt with this issue earlier in the session.
This was doing the licensing for the PAs and the APRNs to administer Schedule II drugs.
I went to the Senate and this is the product that came back in this form.
Was it, they do approve it.
It was only one of the Schedule II drugs.
The milder version did it for three days so that they can do a prescription for three
days still allows it to, still mandates it just has to be reported to the doctor working
under that protocol either upon immediately or within no later than 72 hours.
Also continues to allow them to issue the placards for handicapped vehicles.
And that Mr. Speaker is what it does.
It would just trim down considerably from five to three days
and only one of the scheduled to use drugs.
I believe it was the OXI, I don't know the difference in them,
but one of the questions.
Do you yield for questions?
OXI coding.
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Wolenski in room 341
for a question.
Thank you, does the chairman yield?
Yes, sir.
If I remember correctly, I could be wrong.
The first bill, or is it not true?
The first bill allowed five pills, not five days,
and is this reducing it to three pills or three days?
This allowed, the first bill said five days,
a prescription for five days, and this goes to three days.
Thank you, Chairman.
You further yield?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Reeves to your left for a question.
Yes, sir.
It's gentleman yield.
Yes, sir.
Isn't it true, Chairman Powell, that this body overwhelmingly passed this measure a few
weeks ago, and that this bill continues to be something that is going to be an enormous
help for rural health care in Georgia?
You're absolutely right, given that 46 states in this nation allow prescriptive rights to
VA's and APR's and that's a far cry from what we do.
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate the
favorable consideration of the members and I'll ask
for their vote and step aside.
Is there any objection to the previous question being
ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the Committee

to be taught an act to amend Code Section 16561
of the fiscal to Georgia annotated, related to hazing.
So it's to provide for an expanded definition of hazing this bill ever for the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
Chair recognizes chairman mandy balinger to present the bill
Thank you, mr. Speaker. This is the Max Grover act
Max Grover was a young man who graduated from a Catholic high school bus of Trinity and Roswell, Georgia
He went to LSU and it was during a hazing incident there involving alcohol at LSU that he lost
his life his parents have now gone on a bit of a crusade to strengthen our hazing laws
across the state beginning in Louisiana and also in their home state of Georgia.
The first part of it just says that it's the Max Grover Act.
The second part of this bill allows for the definitions and the third part mandates that
and each school have policies that facilitate the reporting and disclosure of hazing and also it allows for a public report of hazing to be on the website. Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions.
You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ask for your favorable consideration.

The eyes are 164 the nasors zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 49.
Senate Bill 49 by Senator Dixon, the 45th Miller, the 49th Anderson, the 24th Gouge, the 51st
Duke, and the 30th and others.
Any title of act to amend, Chapter 2, Title 8, in the fiscal day of Georgia, annotated
relaying the standards and requirements for construction, alteration of buildings and
and other structures so as to provide procedures
for alternative plan review, permitting, and inspection.
Mr. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Agriculture
Consumer Affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative Bonner
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As a Saturday, I rise to present Senate Bill 49.
This is a continuation of the governor's agenda
to help keep George's economy working during this pandemic.
Under current law, builders and contractors must wait
for the county or municipality to determine whether or not
they can provide services within the statutory timeframe
before a private professional provider can be used.
Under Senate Bill 49, it will allow builders and contractors
to use a private professional provider for plan review
or inspection immediately upon acceptance of their application
regardless of whether the county or municipality ultimately determines that
they could have performed the service. This bill was short in the timeline of
being able to use a private professional provider thus increasing the
efficiency and the building process across the state. This is currently what we
have in place. A builder goes to that municipality, submits their application,
that municipality has five days to review that application and to let that
contractor know whether or not they can provide that plan review. This simply
allows those contractors to immediately put that municipality on notice that
they'll be using a third-party provider for that plan review and they'll still
be required to pay that municipality half of that fee. It does not preclude at
all those municipalities from being involved throughout the inspection process,
but this will simply allow for those contractors and builders to move
through that process that much faster.
With that, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill.
I'll stand for any questions.
You have a question, too, if you care to yield.
I'll yield.
Chair recognizes the minority caucus
with representative Wilkerson to your left for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
Just to clarify, current law, you would have to go through the local municipality or government.
In this case, you'd get to pick who approves it, is that correct?
Well, you are the municipalities under the law have the ability to pre-qualify companies and providers.
So you cannot bring in anyone that is not approved by that municipality.
Thank you for the question.
You further you?
for one more mystery. Chair recognizes representative dukes in room 341 for a
question. With the gentleman you'll please. I will. Michael you said that the
local building authorities will still be involved in the process. That is correct.
I'm trying to to can you tell me what involvement with what they have you
number because typically we have the plan review, then we're going to have foundation inspections
and then roughing inspections if it's residential and then go through the whole litany of inspections.
What if this field passes, what environment would the locals have?
So the local municipality will still have the ability to reject any of the inspectors
that are involved, they'll have the ability to review
any of these plans if they choose,
and they can show up at the job site at any point in time
if they choose to do so.
Thank you.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well
and ask for your favorable consideration.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair hears none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee, which was favorable
the passage of the bill. The chair here's none the report of the committee has
agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the
bill will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the
machines.
All members voted what purpose does Chairman Sensler rise personally to rule 133.
I'd like to be recuse this with Mr. Bigger gentleman has that ride in the journal will so reflect
have all members voted. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of
Senate Bill 49. The eyes are 148th. The nays are 15. This bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the
caption to Senate Resolution 102.
Senate Resolution 102 by Senator Gooch, the 51st speech, the 21st mill of the 49, again
to the 47th, Jones to the 25th and others, a resolution creating the Georgia Commission
on e-commerce and freighted for structure funding.
This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Transportation.
committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper to present the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members.
I bring before you the Georgia Commission on e-commerce and freight infrastructure funding.
This is continuing work on this very important industry in our state.
You and I depend on a thriving, productive, freight and logistics industry.
And we've created a great report in the last two years about what the needs are and
in freight and logistics.
And if you don't have one contact my office, I'll be glad to share it with you.
COVID has accelerated the growth of e-commerce and we know we need to invest more in infrastructure.
We need a professional study to determine the best course of action regarding funding
and policy development.
This is a joint House Senate study committee.
with the four members from the House and Senate,
each and two members each from industry,
which the folks that really know what's going on.
That's our bill, Mr. Speaker.
I'd be glad to answer any questions.
Do you yield for questions?
Absolutely, yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Anola Witts
to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Does it, gentlemen, yields?
Yes, ma'am.
Is it not true that while we don't,
I necessarily think of freight logistics as something that might impact metropolitan areas
as profoundly as our urban areas.
Like the district I represent in Cobb County, we have freight coming through every day on
rail, on trucks, on I-75.
Is it not true that the funding provided through this legislation would help commuters residents
and businesses and make our roads safer and reduce truck traffic and the commensurate pollution
throughout Georgia?
Absolutely, ma'am.
We'll put a member of the Transportation Committee.
Do you further yield?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes Representative Holly up in the gallery to your right for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Do you yield, sir?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that, as we're seeing with the expansion of the Port of Savannah, that
there's plenty of job opportunities and career directives being able to, for our state
to be able to take advantage of, certainly through the work of this study and the findings
have been able to, that we've agreed on?
Absolutely.
In the previous study, we did really identify many of those needs, and now this will help
determine ways to fund them and carry them through.
Thank you, sir, and thank you for being such a quick study coming on to our committee.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that.
Mr. Speaker, I'll be yield the well and ask for your favourable consideration.

Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill or the resolution?
Chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this
resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the
resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machines.
All members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines.
on the passage of, on the adoption of Senate Resolution 102, the eyes are 168th and
knees are zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore adopted. What purpose chair recognizes the chairman of the
House Rules Committee for an announcement?
Yes, sir, we'll probably have a
rules committee meeting about five
o'clock or do you want it
sooner? You're the chairman. How
about five o'clock here? I got one
scheduled you for 11 tomorrow. I'm
sorry. I have one scheduled you for
eleven tomorrow. What will do you five? Rules committee will be meeting at
five o'clock in room 341. We will be in recessed in the house until five
15.
