Good afternoon, a beautiful day out there today, but we're in here for a short time.
We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which
we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 18th House District
Representative Tyler Paul Smith, Representative Smith.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon, members of this August body.
Today I have a very humbling privilege of introducing you to my pastor and also my brother
now just so you know I did let him know we had a little bit of a time constraint today and although
we're meeting in the afternoon this is not one of them uh two services a day revival meetings so
did give him that notice but uh at this time it is my pleasure to introduce my brother Zach Smith
It is a blessing and a privilege to be with you, Mr. Speaker, thank you for this great
honor.
To find gentlemen from the 18th, you may not always call him that and I have not always
called that him that, but I call him that today.
I did tell him when he greeted me at the parking spot, I did tell him that a man of God
is careful when he comes to the capital city because in the Word of God, when the man of
God goes to the capital city. Well, I'm preaching through the book of Mark on Sundays. It usually
means the man of God loses his life. So I'm asking you to help me that that not be the case this day
that I would not lose my life over here as I've come to the capital. But it is a blessing and a
privilege. Let me read our text. I will say a quick prayer and then we will get into the rest of
the actual delivering of remarks. But the text today is simple. It is Genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Let us pray. Father, we pray that it
would not be my words, but that it would be your words today. Father, I pray that you would
quicken it by the means of your spirit within all those that are gathered here. Father, I pray if
anybody not know you, we pray that today would be the day that they come to know you, oh God.
Father, we pray all this and thy son, Jesus Christ, most holy name, amen, amen. He told me I had a
length of time and then it got cut in half when I got the message. So if y'all
will listen fast, I will speak fast. So in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 that's
all that we have time for is to understand that God created the heaven and the
earth. Why would you start out with God created the heaven and the earth?
Because we must know who we belong to. We must know who we are created by. If
this great body is to know how to govern it must be in subjection unto the
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself.
Beloved, if you want to know how to govern
with wisdom, justice, and moderation,
I submit to you that he is the only way.
I submit to you that if you should read
the book of Proverbs day in and day out,
just one verse a day, it should greatly improve your wisdom
and your way in which to govern here among this body,
giving you great wisdom, teaching you great justice,
and teaching you ever more about moderation.
something that I wish each and every one of us had today.
But in this text we see in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.
But by the time that you get to chapter 2 he's formed of man from the dust of the ground
and he especially created man.
He breathed the breath of life into the very nostrils of man.
He had spoken everything else into existence, but when he came to man that was special.
When he came to mankind he breathed the breath of life into the nostrils.
He had a special purpose for mankind.
He told man that man had the responsibility to take care of the garden.
As a matter of fact, that's why we have record of, of why he created humanity in the beginning.
He had created all of this, but he needed to somebody, he needed somebody to take care
of all this.
So he created man.
He gave man a specific set of instructions.
He gave him great freedoms that he should have and he gave him wind limitation and what
did that man do but find that wind limitation and his wife Eve and he both partook of that
which they were not supposed to. In essence, the problem that has had is still
between heaven and earth. When man partook of that which he was not supposed to,
when he broke the order of God, when he openly rebelled against God himself,
that's when the problems crept in. There was only one means of redemption that
was offered. He spoke to that great tempter in that garden and he said that
he was going to send a seed and he was going to send a redeemer and that
But that redeemer was going to crush his head, but that serpent would bruise that redeemer's
heel.
And beloved, that's exactly what happened when Jesus Christ came, lived the perfect fulfillment
of the law that God had given.
He was the second man Adam.
To where the first man Adam failed, the second man Adam was truly the era of God Himself.
And Jesus Christ died upon a cross when he went into that capital city over there that made
me nervous on the way over here.
When he gave his life up, when he took upon himself the son of all those who would believe
on him, that for all those who would believe on him, they may have life everlasting.
Because that's the problem of what happened in the Garden of Eden that day.
Is when man sinned against God, when man openly rebelled against God, it created enmity
between man and God.
There's a temptation among you all that we know that Jesus Christ, we know He's going
to return.
going to be sovereign overall. He is king of kings and he is lord of lords. But that leaves you
here to govern today. Your temptation is to think that it's the other party that's the enemy.
Your temptation is to think that it's the other body across the way that's the enemy.
But the problem is not between you and these others. The problem is between you and God. And
whether or not you will submit yourselves unto him. I submit to you today that if you should
submit yourselves unto God and unto Christ alone that you may truly know how to govern.
That is my prayer and my plea for you today.
We will make these remarks as short as we can.
That is your task today.
You must represent your country, your state,
and your people.
But most of all, you represent Jesus Christ,
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.
May you be in true submission unto Him,
and true obedience unto Him,
that the separation between heaven and earth
may be shortened among this great body,
this day and every day moving forward.
Let us pray.
Father, we thank you for this wondrous and blessed occasion
to be here among this body of God.
Father, the prayer is simple to this, simple this day.
Would you give them wisdom that they may know how
to govern with justice and moderation?
Most of all may they govern to your glory of God.
We pray all these things, and the Redeemer
and the Restor, Jesus Christ, most holy name.
Amen, and amen.
Let us say the Pledge of Allegiance.
the United States of America, and to the Republic on which it stands, one nation on God,
indivisible, with everything in justice for all.

to the house. Today we lost a giant of Georgia, Senator Max Cleveland. Senator Max
Cleveland was a very dear friend to me and to so many others. He lived a life that
That was not without pain and suffering.
That understanding of pain and suffering led him to a life of service where he wanted
to help others and ease their suffering.
understood that all of us are tied together in life and death and we have an
obligation to help each other as much as we can. When I first met him I was
looking forward to it and it was it was such a big moment and I was thinking
about potentially getting into public service after a career in the Army.
And he came in and the first thing that he said to me was, why would you want to do that?
That is the worst possible thing that you could do with your life.
It is a terrible way to make a living and you should not do it.
And I was a little stunned by that, but then we talked for three hours, and at the end
of the three hours, he told me to come over and give him a hug.
And he closed with, I love you brother, and I'm going to help you.
Every conversation that I ever had with Senator Cleveland ended with us saying to each other,
I love you, brother.
He was a mentor to veterans across this country.
Whether in politics or not,
he wanted to help people who wanted to help this country
that he loved so dearly.
He was indeed a patriot.
He was a son of Georgia and he loved the state so much
and so many people.
And he was pained by what has become of our politics today.
And he knew that we could do better as a people
and as a country.
So I don't have the words to honor him appropriately.
But I loved him with all my heart.
I miss him greatly.
I love you, brother.
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House.
I know, I know a relationship of Scott Holcomb and Max Cleveland was very, very strong.
And that's what it's all about standing together.
And our Williams was here yesterday, or represent the Williams here yesterday,
talking about Vietnam.
And Max Cleveland lost three limbs in Vietnam.
U.S. Army captain won the silver and the bronze star.
I met him in 1975.
He was in the state senate in Rampalutu in Governor's last year.
He went on to become the United States Secretary of State and then the United States senator.
the historical monuments I remember being in Normandy once and I visited the
cemetery of the air and his picture was on the wall there as the
administrator for monuments and commissions for the United States of America. I had
a chance to visit Max a little a few weeks ago jump Galaway and I had the
former member of the Donald Trump Constitution had launched and he took me by
and I had a chance to sit with Max for about 30 minutes and had a chance to just reflect
on his life and his career.
And when I got to call last night that he had passed away, I immediately texted the speaker
and I didn't know that I was willing to say a word or two about Max Cleveland.
He was a great Georgian from Lithonia.
He was just a wonderful person, always full of spirit.
and I just wanted to say to you all and ask you all,
if you would, during this time,
whether we would take a moment of silence
and keep this family and our prayers in and our thoughts.
And at this time, as a speaker and members
of the House, as a would, let's take a moment of silence
in the memory of forming the United States Senator
and the George and Max Cleveland.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Douglas for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My colleagues, if you would, join me this afternoon for the home
And one of my players, we've all heard about the young man who was tragically hit by a bus
at an all-bending state university.
Well he happened to be one of my athletes that I've coached for the past three years
before he went off to college.
Out of the 33 NCAA players that I've put in college, he is the first one that I've ever
lost and to this capacity. He was a young man that did everything 100%. We just
buried him about an hour ago and he was the reason I got cussed out by my head
coach. He did everything 100%. Even when we were walking through before the
game. It was at 100%. And my head coach would say, Coach Douglas, will you please get your
player under control? And I said, Coach, you know him, he's been here with you. He does
everything 100%. And that's the way when he went off the school to Virginia, he came
home and he called me and said, Coach, I don't think I can do it. I miss home so much.
I said, well, you're going to school free, right?
He said, yes, sir.
I said, well, finish this year,
and we'll figure out a way to get you back home.
And so when he got home, he called me, he said, coach,
I think I got something at Old Bitty State University.
And I said, go, you'll be close to home.
And I want to thank Smiley for his classic last year
of his classic in Albany State University, the team scored 57 points against Fort Valley
and that was his number, 57.
And all the numbers on the clock added up to 57 when the clock was left on.
So if there was ever a whisper from God and we know he speaks through people, signs
and wonders. That was a sign that he was truly one of his children. And we want to thank you
today for opportunity me. Passed him away. And me able to opportunity to be in his young
man's life because I have all girls. And just thank you. And we would like to give a
of a moment of silence right now for him.
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Bernal

were recognized.
Would you please join me in a moment of silence
for the fathers and their sons or daughters
that made the ultimate sacrifice?
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representatives Gamble and Kasha
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here with my friend
and colleague, Representative Matthew Gamble. We are the House co-chairs for the working
group on addiction and recovery. And we are here today to recognize the strengths and
the effort it takes for people in recovery to get back on their feet. And we are asking
here to help us and to help them. Last session, we passed the bill, special license
bills for people in recovery, who fight the stigma of addiction daily. And I was like
to compare it, we like to say this a lot of times like it's American to pick yourself
up from your bootstrips. So what could be more American than when you have fallen, really,
You hit rock bottom and you pick yourself up and you fight every day, every day because
similar to people who have cancer, addiction is a disease and you fight it every day until
the end of your life.
So I applaud these people, I applaud people in recovery and we ask you to help you and
hand it over to my colleague.
Thank you members of the House.
Just ask that you help us support our over 800,000 people in Georgia that are in recovery
at this time.
our communities all around the state and you all hopefully have access to a
recovery community organization. This license plate certainly adds to our
mission to support them. Thank you.
