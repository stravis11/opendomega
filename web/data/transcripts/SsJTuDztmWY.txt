----------
The Senate will come back to order. The Senate will come back to order. Let me get a motion from you. Let me get a motion from you. I recognize senator from 52. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to remove senate bill 162 off the table. The secretary read the caption. Senate Bill 162, by Senator Huffsteadler, the 50th second and others, the Bill's been telling an act to amend Article 1 of chapter 34, Title 43. The official going to Georgia and the table to the Georgia Composite Medical Board, so as to provide for the Board, to implement an automated credentializing system for healthcare providers in the state to arrive for requirements to right for related matters, to imperial conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate committee on rules recommends that this bill to pass by substance, respectfully submitted, Senator Bras, the 6th District Chairman. Mr. President. The Senate is an ask for unanimous consent to remove Senate Bill 162 from the table, any objection? Objection. Recognize the Senate from the 50th second to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief, but I want to make sure we have the votes here as well. We've been working on a system for licensing and credentialing that will greatly improve the time and our workforce in Georgia. Currently, it takes many months to get credentialed and liarsons in the state for a lot of our physicians and some of our advanced practitioners and others as well. We've been working on a system. We've tried it out on the medical students. They were doing 15 hospitals, 15 sets of paperwork, transcripts, all like that. We now have it working with them already, where they are credentialed at all the facilities. The automated software that is here and has been worked on, we will be able to license anyone with everything normal in about two weeks, as opposed to many, many months, is taken right now. And then we're hoping to follow that up with credentialing that will be, if you're credentialing one, you'll be credentialed all of them. So any hospital has the right to have additional credentialing if they want it. We work with the composite medical board, the Georgia Hospital Association. It's supportive of this bill. It's going to mean that particularly people coming from out of state that we've waited seven months or over a year to be able to hire and we'll be able to get them here very quickly and get people working in Georgia and streamline our paperwork. There's no questions. I'll yield the well. You have no questions, sir. Thank you. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none.

This bill haven't received requisite constitutional majority. Is there for pass by substitute? Recognize as a senator from the 29th for motion. Senator unanimous consent to pull Senate bill 100 from the table. Secretary, the caption. Senate bill 100 by senator Robertson of the 29th, and others, the bill is being tell to like to amend Code Section 31-10-14. We've issued a good order to annotate the way to issuance of a new birth certificate following adoption and legitimate. The jubation of paternity determination is thus to provide for the issuance of a copy of the original birth certificate to certain adult persons who are adopted to run for a fee to run for the form of such copies to see an address terminology relating to birth certificate for a short title for a lady managed to be able to look in laws and further purposes that can be seen under Mr. President.

Mr. President, Senate committee and children and families recommends that this bill do pass respectfully submit in Senator Kirkpatrick, Chairman. That completes the order, Mr. President. Recognize the senator from the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I voted this out twice before. I certainly hope this is the last time you do it. What this legislation does is it treats adopted children with the same respect that we treat biological children. At the age of 18, an adopted child will now be able to go to the health department and get a copy of their original birth certificate. It is nothing more than that. Today if a child wanted to, at the age of 18, they would have to hire an attorney. They would have to go to Superior Court and they would have to give a call order to receive that information. It's that simple. I would greatly appreciate your support on this legislation. And with that, if there are no questions, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. There are no questions, Senator. Thank you, sir. Does any of you as senator which speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill. All those in favor vote aye. Ye. All those opposed, nay. Secretary of the law, the machine. Senator from the 27th, be on standby. All in the pass of the bill, the yeas are 55, the nays are zero. This bill hemmed or ced, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Senator from the 27th. Mr. President, I ask that Senate bill 140 be removed from the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 140 by Senator Dulles, all of the 27th and others. The bill is being tabled to a man, chapter 30, title 43, the official going to George Antiethe. The bill is to optometrist as to ride for doctors of optometry, disment, and cell phone and the civil agents. Two patients, underscoring conditions to ride for related matters, provide for an effective date to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes. I can please see what our Mr. President. The senators move that Senate bill 140 be taken off the table. Is there objection? Without objection. Senator from the 9th, do you put a purpose, you wave it? Okay. Secretary of the law, no objection. Secretary of the law, no objection. Secretary of the law, finish the caption. Senate bill 140 by Senator Dulles, all of the 27th and others. The bill is being tabled to men, chapter 30, title 43. The official going to George Antiethe will be to optometrist and for other purposes, Mr. President, Senate Committee on Health and Human Services recommends this bill to pass, respectfully submit it, Senator Watson-Cherman. That completes the order, Mr. President. We're going to ask Senator from 27th. Mr. President, I know that you knew this already, but I did not know that the human eye, the cornea in particular, has the most nerve endings of any part of the human body. 7,000 nerve endings per square millimeter. It's astounding. So with that, I bring you Senate bill 140. Because with those nerve endings comes a lot of medical challenges and the optometrist currently often have a need to prescribe medicine. Sometimes it's for pain. Sometimes it can prevent the use of oral narcotics. And what this bill does simply is allows them to stock and sell the same medicines that they currently have the ability to prescribe. There's a number of guardrails in the bill that ensure that this is well regulated and controlled. They're not allowed to stock any controlled substances, but this will go a long way to helping patients, particularly who are often in an immediate need of relief. Get that relief. And with that, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions. If there are none, I will yield the well. There are none. Thank you, Senator. Does any other Senator wish to speak for? I guess a measure. Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to green to the board of committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The board of committee is agreed to. Is there objection to main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Main question is ordered. Question is all the passes of the bill. All those in favor of the, yay, opposed, nay. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. Senator from the second. What purpose do you rise? Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the Senator from 26. All right. With that objection, after the vote, he'll be excused. Senator from the 48th, your own date. All in the motion. All in the motion are on the vote. On the pass of the bill, the yays are 54, the nays are 1. This bill, hammer, see the constitutional majority is there for pass. Regan, out of the center from the 48th. Thank you, Mr. President. And ask unanimous consent to please laboriously lift Senate bill 191 from the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 191 by Senator Still the 48th and others, the bill between 10 and 9 to amend chapter A to title 34. The official current George Anatey relates to employment security. So as to revise certain notice provisions, relate to benefits and appeals to provide a definition, drive for related matters to arrive for an effective day to repeal, confer looking laws and for other purposes that can be seen on our Ms. President. Is there objection? That objection? Secretary, finish the caption. Senate bill 191 by Senator Still the 48th and others, the bill between 10 and 9 to amend chapter A to title 34. The official current George Anatey relates to employment security and for other purposes. Mr. President, send the committee on insurance and labor recommends that this bill do pass or subsequently submit its center walker chairman that completes the order of a president. Regan, that's the Senate from the 48th, going wrong way. Thank you, Mr. President. Senate bill 191, Department Bill, George's Department of Labor, it allows applicants who are appealing a result that they receive by mail that they can opt into a portal to be able to respond electronically. Currently, this is a federal program that's administered by the state. It's currently 15 days, we're not reducing that to 15 days. We're simply saying that they can shrink the time down to do it. There are 70 hearing officers in the state. There are currently 8,000 appeals happening right now across Georgia. And in 2024, they handled 70,000 cases. They're currently doing this in about 10 days. We're just trying to get it done a little bit faster. Have any answer any questions? I have no question, Senator. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Senator from the 9th? Oh, she's speaking. All right, you're speaking, huh? Thank you, Mr. President. SB 191, I don't think it means any ill intent. And I do think they're trying to expedite issue. But I rise today just to express a bit of concerns. And I've talked to the Senator about my concerns. And I understand that there's a desire here to modernize and enhance the efficiency of the process. That said, this bill does have some different questions for me that I have not been able to get answers for. Firstly, it's not clear how the Department of Labor is going to confirm receipt of a notice. Regardless of whether sent by mail or email. Sometimes people miss emails. They get sorted into spam. And we all know that the mail system can be erratic. I'm happy for one of the many attorneys here to kind of clarify in this language. What I'm talking about, but my understanding is that among some of the other circumstances where you have official notices like court summings, you get a court summons, you get like 30 days for that. The time here, the time limits here are attached based upon when the recipient receives the document. So when it's initiated instead of when they receive it, that time that 15 day time clock starts at that point. So from the day of issue, the person has to. So if it was mail that 15 day time clock starts, if it was emailed, we don't know whether recipient got it or not. That 15 day time clock starts. From the day it was issued, not the day they received it. And we don't have a way to confirm that they received it. The other part of this bill I have a concern about is the appeal process. The conditions where a decision can be reconsidered or unclear. And it's also not a viable solution to see this kid to a court process. So if the department of labor says, hey, you click at day 14 and the person says, hey, I didn't get the notice. I just got it and fell into my spam. They can appeal with the department of labor, but it has to be an extenuating circumstance. Meaning like, I don't know, car accident, something terrible has happened to you. But I know people and sometimes things just fall by the wayside, especially if you're suffering from unemployment. Maybe you just didn't get it for whatever reason. So if the labor department, you know, kind of says at the 14 day mark that, yes, your circumstances falls into an appeal to where we'll give you more time. The department of labor determines that. But if they say no, your excuse wasn't sufficient enough for us, it wasn't a real emergency. They're going to deny it. And then the claim kind of goes off to a court system. And so now we're creating more of a problem for this unemployed person. Because who determines what is an emergency or why you didn't receive it? You know, it's just kind of unclear to me. So that's the part of the bill I have concerns about that appeal process. And the conditions where the decision can be considered and unclear. And it's also not a viable solution to see that this process, like I was saying, get kicked to a court at the end of the line, which is going to cost the unemployed person more money, more time. And that's not a practical or mindful cost. That is, I think, something someone unemployed should be fighting for in the court realistically. And overall, I don't think this bill is very in touch with the concerns of working people going through the unemployment system. It's already difficult. It's already stressful. And it's a high stakes process. And we don't need to make anything any harder for them. And I don't believe the SB1-19 is, I don't think it's coming from negative intent. I do think they are trying to expedite the process, but I do want to see some accountability that the person following the application got it. And the department of labor knows they got it. And that's when the time clock of the 14, 15 days start. It's just not fair to hold people accountable for completing a process when a timeframe, when they have relatively low control over that timeframe. And I think this bill just needs a little more tweaking and a little more time to consider. I did talk to the department of labor and they maybe possibly can have a time step process via email to where they know the recipient. Actually got the denial notice. And the pill process starts, but we don't have that right now. Nor are mail notifications. They're not certified mail. So we don't know when the person is getting it in their mailbox when that time clock starts. So that's just a few issues that I have. Again, I don't think it's ill intent, but I do think I do have some concerns. And there are just some unanswered questions that I wish we could do it past the 15 days. Apparently there is something lawful where you know, I'm not a federal that they can't extend it past 15 days. I would see it like 30 days. I would like to see 30 days. But those are just some of the questions that I have. And Mr. President, I will. You have a question. You wave Senator from the 36th. Would you do you have a question? A question. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the Senator you? Yes, ma'am. Quickly because of the hours late, I just want to put a pin in this and support your. What you pointed out, isn't it true? That unemployment check is the lifeline that's the system's been designed. You're laid off. Your eligible unemployment. Let's don't create another barrier to get in that check and so that the family can hold it together. Until they get called back to work or get a new job. Isn't it true? Yes, that is true. And I get that they're trying to expedite the process, but we don't want to hold up their check in an appeal if they don't know like they didn't get the notice or you know, fell in the mail, fell into spam that notice. I do want to give them sufficient time to appeal. And it isn't true that this could be addressed. This bill gets to the house that there's a way to clean this up. It's not a federal requirement that you have this 15 day notice. Isn't that true? That is true. I mean, I keep hearing from the Labor Department that it's 15 days. They can't extend to the 30, but again, I would think there's something that can be cleaned up there to extend that window. Yeah, thank you. This is a very important issue for people when they're laid off. It can be a life and death situation in it, true. Thank you. Mr. President, I yield a well. Senator Hizio, does any of the Senator wish to speak for against a measure? Senator from the 48th, would you like to close? You want to wave? Colleagues, I'll be brief. Eight thousand applicants are appealing currently. If we want to speed this up, email is a little bit faster than snail mail. It's a federal program instituted by the state. They're the ones that set the 15 days, not Georgia, of the approximately 70,000 cases handled last year. Nobody's saying they need more time. We're trying to speed it up. So in good faith, we are trying to expedite this, not slow it down. If you want to make it 30 days, you just double the amount of time to get claims processed. Please vote yes. Thank you. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against a measure? Chair here is none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there objection to the Greens of the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none of the four committees agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair is none of the main questions ordered. Questions on the passage of the bill. All those in favor vote yes, all opposed nay, secretary, and not the machine. Senator from 39th, your own deck. On the passage of the bill, the a's are 38 and the a's are 16. This bill haven't received rickson constitutional majority is there for pass. I can ask the senator from the 39th for motion. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to lift SB 252 off the table.

That police, the order, Ms. President. Recognize the senator from the 39th, the speech of the bill. So, everybody please be mindful of Senator In the well, presenting her bill, and every other senator that will come after her. So, keep the noise level down, please. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to keep this very quick. This is a bill specifically for Atlanta, the city of Atlanta, to be able to transfer a piece of property to the Atlanta public school system. We have Hope Hill Elementary School, and next to it there are two parcels, one of which has already been abandoned for public use, and that gym has already been given to the school. Another parcel, which is a tricycle park, has not been abandoned for public use, and therefore, because of code that has been set in 30 plus years ago, cannot just be swapped. We have to do this through a bill. Atlanta, the end of the school system, are both in agreement. This will be an even swap. This tricycle park is a playground for the kids to service the school, and they will be fenced in as a school safety measure. And I ask for your favorable consideration on this bill, and I will yield unless there are any other questions. Yeah, no question, Senator. Thank you. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Hearing none, does any senator object to the previous question be in order? Chair, here's none. The next question is ordered. Senator from the six, do you have something? But you waive? I can't hear you, Senator. Okay, you waive. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board of Committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being in order? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. The second question is on the passes of bill. All those favorable. Yeah, all opposed. No, secretary, I'm not in the machine. Senator. Senator.

from the 30-second year-of.circuit at Mrs. Barbara Phillips, just but not far off So our 56 and the days are zero. Wow. Wow. Senator, sounds like you might need to be the minority group, spokesperson there. So I'm kidding, Senator, from the 20s, I get, don't get sensitive in here. So, all right, on the page of the bill, the days are 56, the days are zero. This bill haven't received regstment constitutional majority. Is there for pass? I recognize Senator from the 30s. Thank you, Mr. President. I would ask that Senate bill 213 be removed from the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 213 by Senator Kropachik of the 32nd and others, built between Title IX and II, Article XV, Chapter 1, Title X, the Fishkin of Georgia, annotated related to the Fair Business Practices Act of 1975. So, as the bank commercial cheating services that target students and examinees, seeking a professional license as an unlawful, unfair and deceptive trade practice, driver definitions, driver statutory construction, driver later matters, repealable voting laws, and further purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Is there objection? The out of Jackson, Secretary of Finisher, the caption. Senate bill 213 by Senator Kropachik of the 32nd and others, built between Title IX and II, Article XV, Chapter 1, Title X, the Fishkin of Georgia, annotated related to the Fair Business Practices Act of 1975. And for other purposes, Mr. President, Senate Committee, I regularly introduce your easing utilities. Recommendants of this bill do pass, reflect, with minutes, and a Couser Chairman. That completes the order, Mr. President. Oh. Mr. President, Senator Kropachik of the 32nd and others, offered the following amendment 1 to amend Senate bill 213 by striking as an unlawful, unfair and deceptive trade practice, on lines 3 and 4 by inserting before to provide for definitions on line 4 of the following to limit enforcement to public enforcement by the Attorney General by replacing, without otherwise limiting the definition of unfair, deceptive acts and practices under this part, it, on lines 49 and 50, with it, by inserting between lines 56 and 57, the following, D, any violation of subsection B, of this Code shall constitute an unfair, deceptive act or practice in the conduct of consumer transactions, and for other purposes, that completes the order, Mr. President. I can ask the Senate from 30 seconds to speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. Senate Bill 213 is about commercial cheating services. These companies advertise that they will take your test for you, take your online course or licensing exam, do your homework or write your essay. This is a billion-dollar industry that has increased in recent years, primarily spread by word of mouth and social media. Four countries have passed laws to prohibit this, with legislation pending in a number of states. This activity threatens academic integrity and public safety. There are numerous examples that I won't go into, the hour is late. This bill makes it unlawful for any person, for a commercial purpose, to provide a work product, in a substantially completed form. The bill is in the unfair trade practice, as part of our law, with civil penalties outlined in the law, to be determined by the Attorney General. I do have the amendment that makes it clear that this is civil, rather than a private cause of action. This bill levels the playing field, and I would ask for your support, and I would be happy to answer any questions. You have no question, Senator. Thank you. Are you? Does any of the senator wish to be for against a measure? Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous question is ordered. The question is on the adoption of amendment one, authored by the senator from the 32nd, author of the bill. Is there objection to amendment one? Objection amendment one is added. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. And the main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill. As amended, all those in favor of the bill, who, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, and lot of machine. What's going on there? Senator from the 14th, you're on deck. And it is his first bill ever in the legislative body. The bill is on the passes of the bill. The yays are 53. The nays are one. This bill haven't received the reccement constitutional majority. Is there for pass as amended? I recognize the senator from the 14th. Mr. President, I would move that SB 173 be removed from the table. Secretary of the Cabinet. Senate Bill 173 by Senator McLean, before the bill is handed. The bill has been submitted. The president will be removed from the table. Secretary of the Cabinet, please. Senator McLean, please. The bill is handed. The bill is handed. Secretary of the Cabinet. Senate Bill 173 by Senator McLean, before the 14th and others, the bill is handed to amend Article 3 of Chapter 11, Title IX, the official code of Georgia annotated. The law of pleadings and motions has authorised movements to file notices of uncontested motions and superior court and state courts to write for uncontested motions to be deem granted to write for review by chief judge and any judge with two uncontested motions deem granted. Hello, pink exposure. Can you vote or should it have a point in order to gel with these zweiten questions? Uh-huh. The intent is not to hazel votes, but not to exhibiting them. The case is based on previous cases from EulissBL or Mercedes Bautzont Legislative Law for the and the Senate Committee on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass respectfully a minute, Senator Strickland-Cherman, that police should order Ms. President. President, I'm going to ask Senator for the 14th. Speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President and colleagues. I am honored to bring you SB 173. We talk a lot about judicial backlogs, about cases that fill the dockets of courts. This is only for civil cases and essentially what it is. If there's an uncontested motion, meaning a motion in a case that nobody objects to, no party, no valid intervener, that's been sitting around for three months, then it gives a party that makes the motion the ability to sort of tap the court on the shoulder and say, hey, this has been sitting for three months, then gives the judge a week to rule on the motion if the judge doesn't act. It's deemed granted. It's got the tiniest little tickle of accountability at the end about having the chief judge look at a judge's docket if this happens twice. Lawyers bringing bills to constrain judges even a little bit, usually kind of a scary thing for lawyers to do. The judges have been great to work with in this process. I've gotten great feedback from the superior and state court judges on this. So we're hoping to get this to the house where if they want to put some more stuff in they can. But that's basically the bill and I'm happy to take any questions, Mr. President. Would anybody like to question the Senator's judicial doge project here? So wonderful idea, Senator. Regan, I'm Senator from the 37th. Thank you, Mr. President, Jill and you. I do. Could you describe to me this tickle of accountability a little bit more detail? That's right. So on the second page of the bill, starting at number 20, if a judge has this happen twice, so it emotions granted automatically twice after that week long opportunity, then the chief judge of the circuit just looks at the judge's document management techniques and issues of a report. I don't think this is going to candidly change the behavior of the judges we're talking about in some cases, which again, the vast majority of judges do a very good job of timely, ruling on motions, but every attorney has a war story or a horror story about emotions that sits for a year, for two years. And so this is just a way to remind the court, speed up the process, to give them an opportunity to rule on something that shouldn't be controversial at all. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I have a few more questions, Senator. I reckon I was sitting from the 42nd. Senator, you. I do do the judiciary chairman. Senator, you just said the vast majority of judges basically aren't a problem, correct? Oh, and I wouldn't characterize the ones who are not in the vast majority as a problem. What I would say is that there are times when, you know, dockets get overwhelmed, judges need a little bit of help in, you know, paying attention to the thing that needs attention. Do you further you? I do. So which judges do you think need that extra help? Who are you referring to? You know, I have really adopted the habit of not saying any names from the well, and I think that's a practice that is good to extend to all members of the general public if you can help it. Do you further you? I do. So which circuits do you see this problem then? You know, I would never, I would never want to specify which circuits or which counties have particular issues. Look, my practice brings me to a lot of different counties, and in that process you get to see a lot of different things, Mr. Chair. Do you further you? I do. Which counties do you practice in? I mean, I practice throughout the state, I practice in Metro Atlanta, down I-16, down I-75 up in North Georgia, you know, I really, I mean, probably 150 nine counties. I could tell you the ones I haven't practiced in, taking them and think about it. Do you further you? Yes, Mr. Chair. Do you have an example of one county down the O16 corridor that's getting it right? Okay, I had this one motion, okay, I really mad about it. Look, I think that you know very well as a lawyer legislator, this is a touchy subject to talk about judges and the way that they rule on things, but, oh, you got the microphone back up. But I really have been grateful for the feedback from judges who say, look, we understand that lit against need practical solutions when their cases are dragging. All right. I've read about a senator from the 27th. Thank you, Mr. President. You're the last senator I'm going to yield to. I've waited a long time for this moment. This is a senator you. I do. We are carefully crafting an amendment back here. I would like to just know what your preference would be. We are working to replace all instances of either a superior court judge, a state court judge, a judge. I think that covers it. And we're going back and forth. Should we change it so that it reads in the event that Elon Musk fails to rule upon a properly served motion, or would you prefer something along the lines of, on line 17 perhaps, should Donald J. Trump continue to fail to rule upon a motion? Which would be a preferable friendly amendment to you of the two options? Mr. Senator, I am indifferent because you just gave our crack social media team the clip they need to keep time musk and trump together. So thank you again for that, Mr. Senator. Senator, do you continue to yield? For one final question, because I need to get out of the well. It's not a question, Senator. I do just want to say that I appreciate you rolling back the red tape. And I would like to commend you for bringing this bill, because it is a good piece of legislation. And I would look forward to voting for it. Thank you, Mr. Senator. Notwithstanding whether the further questions I yield the well. Wow. We want to highlight more of your disapproval of the judicial system in Georgia. I can't wait for the next judge that you appeared for right here. So we've got another amendment here. Is this a serious amendment? All right, we'll read the amendment. Now hopefully you'll withdraw the amendment here. Mr. President, Senator Hatch, the 50th and others off of the following amendment one to Senate Bill 173. By striking notice of uncontested with pile driver on line 16. Mr. President, I can't wait to you either. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to bring this amendment. I had a serious bill the other day and I realized that the Senateary Sponsors bill is a huge wrestling fan. And so to honor that, I want to do honor his bill by adding this amendment that he probably hadn't thought of and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. I believe the amendment's out of order, so we're going to just go ahead and put that all aside. I know it's awful, isn't it? Does any other Senator wish to speak for against measure? Chair here is none. I'm not recognizing him. Is there objection as the previous question be it ordered? Chair here is none. Previous questions ordered. Is there objection to agree to the Board of Committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. Board of Committee has agreed to. Is there objection as the main question be it ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill? All those in favor vote? Yeah, I'll pose nay. Secretary and lot of machine. Senator from the 48th, what purpose is he, Roz? Parliamentary and cream. Mr. Secretary. Mr. President, if we do look at Senate Bill 173 and we examine by word search lines 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 15, 16 on page 1, there are six instances where the word do is spelled in this bill. I was wondering if we could add a second Trump floor later to this body. I recognize Senator from 19th, what purpose do you rise? Parliamentary and cream. Mr. President. The Senate rules allow for us to respond to a ruling on whether or not a amendment is germane. I didn't hear you. What did you say, Senator? I saw it was French. You guys speak into the mic, Senator. All the passes of the bill, the a's are 49 and the a's are 5. That's bill hammer's seed, the constitutional majority is there for us. We're going to send it from the third. Mr. President, I move Senate Bill 245, be lifted from the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 245 by Senator Hodges of the third and others, the bill to be in town on the amendment. Section 19-7-3, the Fish and Georgia annotated. We'll add two actions by grandparents or other family members for visitation rights or intervention, revocation or amendment of visitation rights, appointment of guardian and litum, medigate, meditation hearing and notification to family members of child's participation and events derived from later matters to repeal public voting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Is there objection? Without objection, recognize the senator from the third. Thank you, Mr. President. Love to follow the senator from the 14th. Our colleagues, they give you Senate Bill 245. It is a bill that's good for families and grandparents. It allows grandparents who already have visitation rights granted by a court to go back to court to modify those rights. Current law allows parents, guardians and legal custodians such rights but not grandparents. This bill was brought to me by constituents. Couple of retirees on St. Simon's had a grandchild by their son and daughter-in-law. One died in his early 30s of a massive heart attack and my constituents thought that it would be in the best interest of the grandchild to petition the court to seek a change in their visitation rights. They found that as grandparents they had no standing under current law to petition to modify their rights that were established by an earlier order. As a matter of fact, their lawyer gave them a Georgia pellet court case from October of 23, NAMDAR versus NAMDAR, which found that grandparents who previously been granted visitation rights have no right to file an action seeking to modify the existing visitation order. This bill corrects that. I will just say that I acknowledge that Georgia law does and should defer to parents of children about their visitation rights. I really don't believe it right for grandparents to be shut out of the modification process under all circumstances. I would ask you to remember that a judge would still have to hear facts and make a final determination and that this bill does not change any of the standards of which such a judge would rule. And the ideal for questions. You have no question, Senator. Thank you. Appreciate it. Does any of the Senator which speak for against the measure? Senator from the 18th floor, George. Senator Mr. President, I'm going to be brief, but this is a very important bill. I'm going to thank the Senator and the third for bringing this. Grandparents are part of the fabric of families all across our state. And in many cases, they really provide the family stability in families that face them the greatest challenges. We've got a law that allows judges to determine whether visitation with grandparents is in the best interest of the child. And that seems completely natural. The law is not clear once visitation is granted whether or not those same grandparents can seek to modify the visitation that they've been granted. As recently as 2022, this chamber, I'm proud to say, voted unanimously to reaffirm that grandparents should be able to seek visitation rights in a bill sponsored by the Senator from the 42nd. Since then, I've heard from families in my district as I suspect that you have to, that you couldn't seek to modify their visitation because of this gap in the law that the Senator from the third is seeking to modify. I want to also thank the Smiths who used to live in making in my district, sharing their story with the Children and Families Committee and I offer my condolences to the loss of their son. All they want is to add a couple of days a year to the current visitation that they enjoy with their grandson. And that gap, as I mentioned earlier, means they cannot go back to court and ask for more days. So, let's close the gap. Thank you, Senator, for bringing this. I joined with the Senator from the third and I hope many others of you for standing up for Children and Families in this state. Thank you very much. I urge your strong support for this bill. I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Does any of the Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Has the objections to previous question be in order? Chair, here's an previous question as ordered. Is there objections to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's an unimportant committee, as agreed to. Is there objections to the main question be in order? Chair, here's none of the main questions is ordered. Questions on the passage of the bill? All those in favor vote, yay. All opposed, nay.

Thank you. Great. I'm Senator from the 8th. Thank you, Mr. President. Don't be quick. Senate bill 119 is a good affordable housing bill currently if someone buys a mobile home and they want to convert it into real property. They have to get signed off from the lender. The average median income in this state is $74,000. If you have to have it, I'm sorry, finance as child property. The best you can get is 15-year amortizations at 12, 13, 14-percent interest. If you can convert it into real property, you can get a 30-year mortgage at regular mortgage rates. And so anyway, good bill. Just do not want to get the sign off from the lender to convert it into real property. If you have no further questions, I will yield the will. You do have one question, Senator. I recognize Senator from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. With the Senator Yeal. I do. Isn't it true if you mess with the one you mess with the whole trailer park? That's a fact, Senator.

We've gotten out of this chamber a couple of times, we've fallen short over in the house. Hopefully we'll be able to get it through, but this bill allows the Department of Education to have a pilot program for outdoor classrooms in the state. They're a great learning opportunity for kids and I just ask for your favorable consideration. I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the bill.

Constitutional majority is there for pass by substitute. Recognize the senator for the 29th for a motion. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that SB 98 be taken off the table. 298 I think is what you mean, Senator. SB 298 yes sir. Secretary read the caption. Senate bill 298 by Senator Robertson of the 29th. The bill to be in title and act to amend Code Section 5-6-34. The OCGA will have two judgments in rulings named directly appealable.

Mr. President, that completes the order. Is there objection? Objects and secretary finish. Senate bill 298 by Senator Robertson of the 29th and there's a bill to be in title and act to amend Code Section 5-6-34. The OCGA will have two judgments in the rulings named directly appealable and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute or start with some minutes under Strickland Chairman. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Judiciary, I was following substitute to Senate bill 298. It builds me in title and act to amend Code Section 5-6-34 of the OCGA will have two judgments in the rulings named directly appealable. And for other purposes, Mr. President, they complete the order. We're going to send it from the 29th, speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is another opportunity to make our court system is more efficient. What this bill does is in all judgments, orders and rulings, denies are refusing to grant immunity based upon sovereign. Municipal official, qualified or any other immunity established by the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Georgia. What it allows for is that when the municipalities come before the court and ask for immunity, if immunity is denied, they have the opportunity to do an immediate direct appeal. Currently under the system, the case will be adjudicated and they would only be allowed to appeal at the end, which is a lot of time and a lot of money, especially based on the amount of discovery. What this would allow them to do is petition to the judge at the beginning for an appeal. They have one week to file that appeal and once the judge denies the appeal or a grantee appeal, they can no longer apply for another appeal in the process. So it makes the system work much more efficient. With that, Mr. President, I'll stand for any questions. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question to be in order? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered.

Mr. President, Senate Committee on Education Youth recommends that this bill do pass by substitute or strictly sub-minute senator Hickman Chairman. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Education and Youth Office of the following, substitute to Senate bill 93, bill is being titled act to amend. Code section 20-2-153.1 of those, the Georgia Early Literacy Act. So as to prohibit the three queuing system from inclusion and for other purposes, Mr. President, that completes the order. Record on the Senate from the 38th. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, 70% of our fourth graders are struggling to read on grade level and 69% of our eighth graders are struggling to read on grade level. The purpose of this bill is to strengthen the Georgia Early Literacy Act and a hard work of Senator Hickman and Representative Ballard to ensure that our students are not being taught using a flawed method. I is true. Oh, I'm sorry. Senator from the fourth. My apologies. To ensure that our students are not being taught using a flawed method of teaching reading known as three queuing. Of course, we're going to keep learning and building on our successes. As an educator, I've known for a long time that something had to be done to improve literacy, not only in Georgia, but across the nation. And I'm determined to make Georgia the number one state in the country for reading. That's why I came to the Senate, eager to work with the Senator from the fourth. I got it right. And strengthen the Early Literacy Act. The bill defines three queuing and ensures educators new and old are not given a flawed tool that teaches students to guess, not to read. Over a dozen states have taken this step, including my own home state of Ohio, which in many ways is ground zero for this technique. I've heard horror stories from parents who just want their child to know how to read. Many of these parents can trace their child's literacy crisis back to being taught students to read using three queuing. When I bring legislation, I don't just want to bring words on a paper, but the voices of constituents. And former Georgia Elementary teacher and mom, Missy Purcell said this. The math you entered school as a bright, curious learner, eager to explore the world through books. But instead of receiving evidence-based reading instruction, he was taught using three queuing, an approach that encouraged guessing rather than decoding. This method did not teach him to read. It taught him to guess, leaving him anxious, struggling, and believing he wasn't capable for this first five years of school. No child should experience that. As a former educator trained at the University of Georgia, I wish someone had told me and my colleagues that we were using ineffective and harmful tools. Decades of research confirm that skilled reading comes from decoding words, yet some universities across our state are still training future educators and debunk practices. Three queuing remains in our classroom despite Georgia's early literacy act and the dyslexia bill. As Brunei Brown said, clear is kind. Making it clear which tools are ineffective and even harmful does not limit teachers. It empowers them. Passing this bill ensures state colleges trained future teachers and evidence-based practices. Kids like my son Matthew are counting on you. Colleagues for parents, teachers, and kids like Matthew, I ask for your considerable consideration. And with that Mr. President, I would love to see your board as I yield for questions. You do have some questions. Brunei is from the 42nd. Does Senator yield? Yes, I did. I appreciate your bill. I have other questions for you. You're not the first senator to have your last name in this body. Are you? No, sir. In fact, I'm not. And the last senator to hold my last name now resides in the governor's mansion. Do you further yield? I do. So comparing the work that you're doing here as a senator with your last name versus the work, the previous senator with your last name did. Who's doing a better job? Senator, this bill has to go downstairs to the governor's office. So I'm going to defer to the current holder of that governor's mansion. Say he did a wonderful job in this Senate. Oh, it's a good answer. Congratulations. All I got. No more questions for you. Learning quick. We're going to have Senator from the 56. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the senator yield? Yes, Mr. Chairman. I do. Senator, I've read this bill. This has to do with reading. Is that accurate? It does. Do you further yield, Senator? Have you ever read our Senate rules? I have. Senator, how do we address people in this chamber? You know, Senator, I got so excited about working with the gentleman from the fourth that I just had to speak his name. I understand. Senator, you further yield? I do. Are you familiar with the Common Core methodology of teaching? Is that what you used when you grew up? No, we did not. Finally, we used to have a senator here, a great senator from the 53rd District. And he used to ask an important question to all incoming freshmen. Are you familiar with the words moral, liker, moral, I have quite a few bills from this well. Well played Senator, you're still my second favorite camp in the building. Freight on the center from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, are you you? Yes, I do. I know it's the Senate Bill 93. Is that the year you were born? It's a little, five years? No, it was not the year I was born. I'm sorry. You've lived a clean life. I was trying to do the math. Clearly this is not a math bill. It was a reading bill. Maybe we need to do a math bill next. Well, he's a lot older than you. He's a lot older than you. He's a lot older than you. He's a lot older than you. He's a lot older than you. What's Senator further you? I do. What's the previous Senator camp do in math bill? You say did he do a math bill? I'm not familiar that he did a math bill, but I do know that he started the equine association. Gotcha. Well, that's very important to your bill I can tell. The Senator, you'll just a little bit further. I do. A couple of questions. I noticed on page 39 you give additional powers to the majority party. Thank you for that by allowing the professional standards commission to adopt rules and establish criteria for the bill. Can you tell me the names of the members of that professional standards commission? You know, I don't know the names of the members of the PSC, but I truly enjoyed working with Jody at the PSC to perfect this bill. They were great partners and I really appreciate the work that they're doing and will continue to do to make sure students are taught. And teachers are prepared to teach students to read in the right way. Senator, you're extremely sharp. I want to ask you one last question though that I noticed you may have hidden in this bill. Probably something that if I would have thought of, I would have hidden in this bill. Will you yield for one more question? I will. I notice online 15 you make it very, very clear that you want to set English language arts and reading standards. Are you suggesting that we adopt that as the official language? Mr. Chairman, I'll let you be the judge of that. I recognize Senator for a 30 second. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, would you yield? Yes, ma'am. I'm looking at your bill and you know, we've had a lot of conversations about providing explicit material to young children. So I'm noticing in line 46 that you're preparing teachers to provide explicit approaches. And I just wondered if you could explain that. Madam Chairman, I'm just trying to make sure that kids are able to read clearly and understand what they're reading to know that I'm not speaking about explicit material in that section. You're not, sorry, would you further you? I further you. You're not speaking about explicit material then why does it say explicit right there on line 46? Because we want to make sure that teachers have clear cut ways that are going to work to teach our kids how to read. Thank you. All right Senator, this is moment in time when you yield the bill. Colleagues, we have a lot of work to do as it relates to making sure our kids are prepared probably to read and ask for your favorable consideration for this bill. Thank you. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous question is ordered. Questions on adoption of the committee? Substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee? Substitute. Here you none. The committee is adopted.

All opposed, nay. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. Senator from the... 34th. Your own day. Thank you. The bill is agreed to. The bill is agreed to. The bill is agreed to. The bill is agreed to. On the passage of the bill, the yay is our 50 and the yay is our 3. This bill has received. The right-side constitutional majority is therefore passed by substitute. Reconyze, Senator from the 34th. Form motion. Sorry? No, we got a new one. We got a new one, come for the wind. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, as will the unanimous consent for Senate Bill 236. We move from the table. The Senate has moved. Secretary Reed caption. Senate Bill 236, based on our weeks, the 34th and others, the Bill's being titled an act to amend Code Section 20, as true as 150 of the Fishercutter, Georgia, and Anteo, led to eligibility for enrollment on the quality basic education act. So it's a ride that certain students whose parents, or guardians are in active duty in the United States. Those are eligible for enrollment in the public school of the intended zone of which they intend to reside regardless of whether they've entered into a lease, purchased a house or otherwise secured housing within such a intended zone to provide for a later marriage to a group of looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Is there an objection? An objection? Secretary, finish the caption.

Thank you, Mr. President. And good evening, colleagues. I just want everybody to know that this is a Veterans Bill. And me being 830, your Army veteran, this bill would allow parents of military children to enroll their children into public schools with the intent of residency with their military orders. With that, Mr. President, I yield the well. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not how it works, Senator. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you'll be good and take a few questions here and there. We want to hear what that voice sounds like at yours, because you're so quiet in here. All right, let me recognize the center from the 56th. Thank you, Mr. President. Is the good Senator yield? I do. Senator, I just applaud your fantastic service for us in the military and bringing this bill. I noticed it's really an education bill. Is there a reason why I went through the Veterans and Homeland Security Committee and not the education committee? Yes, because the Mr. President assigned it to the Veterans and Homeland Security Committee. Good answer. So I notice in this bill, Senator, if you'll further yield, that you're allowing a student, if their parents aren't fully moved to that area, to go to the school of their choice, is that correct? I actually know what I'm saying is that me having dependence when I was stationed abroad, it just narrows it down to the duty station versus waiting on proof of residency. Senator, you further yield? I do. For one more question. So I think it states in your bill on line 19, if you've not entered into a lease or purchased a residence, they'd have a school choice to pick that out. Are you a school choice supporter now, Senator? Don't wait, Senator, just answer. Yes, no. Welcome to the team, Senator. Welcome to the team. With that, Mr. President, how are you doing? Oh, come on, come on. You can do a couple more. It's going to be painless, I promise. All right. Recognize Senator from the six. Are you serious? Thank you, Mr. President. Does the Senator yield? I do. Senator. Can you explain to this body why you just voted against your fellow freshmen from the 38th bill when you were coming up next? Right. So I explained to my freshman colleague the three musketeers why I was going to vote against this bill. And? It's an internal conversation. Chair, Mr. Chairman, I apologize. Would you further yield? I do, Mr. Chairman. Would you say I'm on a knee to no basis? That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Do you think the Senator from the 38th should vote for your bill? Yes, because this is a veterans bill. And with 14 million veterans out there that has sacrificed their life and the children because this is an educational bill, they want to make sure that upon receipt of their orders that they're allowed to register their children to the next duty station. One last question, Senator. If you would yield. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Can you name all the veterans that serve in this body and what branches they serve in? Thank you. Yes, Mr. Chairman. So I got the Senator from the 33rd. 43rd. 33rd. He was in the Army. Let's go to an easier question. I recognize Senator from the 37th. Thank you, Mr. President, to the Senator from the 34th. Do you yield? I do. I think you saw the display in your predecessor in the well, the Senator from the 38th was struggling to command this issue of district numbers for senators. I think you and your wisdom probably have a command of that. Isn't it true that none of us get here alone? There's those help get us where we are and you're here with the help of others. Is that not true? That is correct. That being the case, I see the list of distinguished senators that are your co-sponsors on this bill. Could you recite for this body the Senate district numbers of your Senate co-sponsors on this bill since they help get you here? I can. That would be the Senator from the 54th, the Senator from the 9th, the Senator from the 8th, the Senator from the 6th. Is it a great to come prepared? That is correct. Thank you very much. The last one, Senator. This is going to be a friendly one. I recognize Senator from the 38th. Does my sister yield? I do. I'm very curious to know if you may have accidentally pressed the wrong color button in the long, the last vote. I did press the wrong button and I owe you dinner. I ask for unanimous, favorable consideration and I yield the well. All right, Senator. All right, good job. Good job, Senator.

All right. That was well worth it. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objections to the previous question be it ordered? Chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Here none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the reporter committee which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none of the 40 committee is agreed to. Is there objections to the main question be it ordered? Chair is none of the main questions. Order questions on the past of the bill. My substitute all those in favor vote. Yeah, I'll pose. Chair here in line the machine. Senator from the 42nd your own debt. Chair here in line the machine. Owned the passage of the bill the a's are 54 and the a's are one this bill haven't received a right constitutional majority is there for pass by substitute. Senator from the 42nd. Senator from the 42nd. Ashen Amos consent that we left Senate bill 132 from the table. Secretary read the caption. Senator bill 132 by senator stricken over 40 second and others built between 10 and 9 to men part two articles six or chapter seven tell us 17 of the OCA related to insane the immensial capacity so as to acquire a hearing before a court orders and evaluation of the mental competency of an accused person to stand trial to ride for the release reports of such evaluations to establish different procedures in cases where the subject has been accused. Only of one or more nonviolent misdemeanor offenses including automatic dismissal in some cases subject to exceptions to ride for such different procedures and such exemptions to provide for later matters to prevent the date and applicability to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes that can be see what our mispresident is objection. Senator senator bill 132 this bill comes as a recommendation from the advisory committee on forensic competency from the Georgia behavioral health reform innovation commission the section that is chair by judge Gosling up in the hall counting and what we're doing with this bill is addressing the competency process is where someone is charged with the crime either the individual themselves their lawyer the prosecutor or the judge raises the issue whether or not they're competent enough to face the charges that they have the process that we have now has a big backlog we're trying to process individuals to have the initial determination of competency and then if you have to be restored to competency the process takes even longer so with this bill we are doing two different things in the front end we're requiring a hearing initially to make sure that we have some due process built in also some protection as a gatekeeping process when someone has the issue of competency raise as initial hearing is where not put you into that process. Second when it comes to nonviolent misdemeanors we're putting a shot clock a shorter time clock on the process the number of days that you have to be evaluated and also the number of days you'll be restored because what we have currently is individuals that are sitting in our system longer than they would if they played guilty for their charges waiting for competency restoration this bill comes not just with support from our Georgia behavioral health reform innovation commission but also from the D.B.H.D. NAMI Georgia Council Recovery Georgia Mental Health Policy Partnership all those that work on mental health issues here at the Capitol appreciate their support and their work on this bill. Happy to answer new questions. Yes, I have a question so ask for your vote on Senate bill 132. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure. Chair here's none is there objections to the previous question being ordered. Chair here's none the previous question is ordered.

Mr. President, Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute or circumstances and then walk or chairman. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor, our saline substitutes at 7.111 to build some entitlement act to amend, title starting 3 and 40 of the OCGA, will only do insurance and motor vehicles and traffic, and for other purposes, Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to ask Senator from the 16th. Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it. This is SB 121. It has to do with insurance limits for people with DUIs. Currently, other Georgia law, we have not raised our limits for 14 years. This kind of gives you at least a look of what's going on. Current limits are $25,000 for any one person, $50,000 for anyone accident, and $25,000 for the rest of the country. And $25,000 for property damage. Most of us drive cars that are more than $25,000 that are going on today. What this does is first defense for DUI would normally stay at the same limits. What this bill does for our first time offender, it would raise their limits to 50, 150, so that that would be there as an additional part. If they have a second DUI, they would then be required to raise that limit to one person. Most of the states around us are very similar except for Florida. Florida, in 2007, raised the limits to one hundred, three hundred, 50 for first time offense. They're required to keep the limits for three years. That's a requirement, and they're also required to carry proof that they do have insurance. That's part of the reinstatement of their license that's required. It's called SR-22 that's required. And I think that's the reason why we're doing this. The reason why we're doing this is because we're doing this to the required. And I think this is something we need to look at when someone is DUI, we need to have at least a little bit more limit on there. Because the fines they pay at the courts go to the courts, this raises the limit to protect the general public and to protect me and you if we have an incident with a driver who is DUI. That's it. Any questions? No questions. Thank you for your answer. Sorry. Senator from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, the Cinder yield? Yes, sir. Senator, I know you've got great intentions with this legislation, but other than DUI, your legislation also includes reckless driving. Is that right? No, sir. That was changed in committee. We were warning that, but we did not get that. So we decided we'd go ahead and take the DUI so we could get that and get that done. Okay, thank you for clearing that. Okay. Okay. Clarifying that. Thank you, sir. Senator from the 29th. The Cinder yield? Yes, sir. I was looking for you. Senator, could you expound on that just a little bit more as to why the reckless driving was taking out? When we were in committee, that was one of the things that felt like that because the reckless driving was a charge that was not necessarily DUI, that we would not move it and other states had not used that combination of DUI and reckless driving. So we just stuck with the DUI level. Thank you, sir. Yeah, no further questions. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your favorable consideration. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to their previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous question is ordered. Questions only adoption of the committee's substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute? Here, none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill. By substitute, all those in favor will vote yea, all those opposed nay. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. Senator, from the 22nd, your own deck. The committee's are two. This bill, hammer, seated. The rest is going to be requisite. Constitutional majority is therefore passed by substitute. Reganise the senator from the 22nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Ask the unanimous consent to remove SB204 off the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 204 by Senator Jones, the 22nd and others. The bill is going to be entitled to amend Code Section 17-7-70.1 of the OCA willing to trial upon accusations in certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea and guilty or no look in tendres. So as to allow for offenses that are not serious, violent felony, sexual felonies or other certain offenses to be charged by accusation of the district attorney to arrive for definitions, to arrive for a condition, to arrive for a related matter. So repeal, conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President, I completely order. Is there objection? Objections. Secretary, finish the caption. Senate bill 204 by Senator Jones, the 22nd and others. The bill is entitled to amend Code Section 17-70.1 of the OCA willing to trial upon accusations in certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea and guilty or no look in tendres and further purposes. Mr. President, the committee on judiciary recommends that this bill do pass or submit it to Mr. Trickland Chairman that please do order, Mr. President. Recognize the minority leader. Present the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. This is SB 204, basically an efficiency and transparency bill, efficiency and two levels. Number one, it allows the district attorney to be able to charge non-serious felonies by accusation and also non-sexual felonies by accusation. This also would not apply. Accusation process would not apply to a deputy that will be charged with a crime. So the police officer actually was charged that would still go through the grand jury process. With this allows the district attorney to be able to basically charge by accusation in certain non-serious felonies, non-sexual felonies. But it would not apply to a deputy that would still go through the grand jury process. Also, efficiency from the standpoint that is, many of your deputies right now are going through this grand jury process on these non-serious felonies and they're sitting for hours and hours and what they really need to be doing is actually out there in the street actually protecting people. Especially in your rural counties, they may be there all day and what they really need to be doing is in the process of actually doing their job. Also, this allows victim cases to be moved faster into the queue, whether it's being charged by accusation or it's being charged by grand jury. I'll make the note that actually 25 states right now make a grand jury optional. 23 states including Florida and Texas actually would be doing exactly what we're doing in this particular bill to where non-serious felonies and non-sexual felonies could be charged by accusation. With that message present now, I entertain any questions. You do have one question Senator. Recognize Senator from the 42nd. Senator you? Yes. I just wanted to ask you, I think you hit on at the end there. While this may seem like a big move in the law, isn't it true that this puts us more in line with the majority of states in our country as far as how we deal with the grand jury process versus accusations? That's exactly right. As stated, actually 25 states make it optional to do a grand jury accusation. And then 23 other states including such states as Florida and Texas, we will be following what they do, where says no grand jury for non-serious violent felonies and also no sexual felonies. And one other question if you will. Yes. I also hear in committee that with the grand jury process, we have a lot of officers that have to stay up after working shifts or aren't on the streets when they're having to wait for the grand jury process with your bill passing as officers to be back on the street or back home with their families. 100% they'll be able to go back home. You may have a deputy that's actually working a 7 to 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. He then or she has to go to court at 9 a.m. and yet also have to go back on to the road at 7 p.m. This allows them to basically get their sleep and as you take care of their family to miss that kind of process was not really needed. Any other questions? Without a yield of wellness person. No other questions. Does any other senator wish to speak for against a measure? Chair here is none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. Chair here is none. The other question is on the passes of the bill. All those in favor. We vote. Yay. All those opposed. Now you secretary on the machine. So you're going to have to go through the process to make sure that all of the members of the community are ready to go through the process. The last question is on the passes of the bill. All of the members of the community are ready to go through the process. This is the main question being ordered. Chair here is none of the main questions. Order questions on the passes of the bill. All of those in favor. Senator from the 20th, your own day. Prior to the则. Own the passed as the bill. The yeas are 51, the dais are four. This bill had received medicine. 這個悍還會是這樣. I can ask the senator from the 20th. I make motion, next boy. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask respectfully that the Senate bill 284 be removed from the table. Senator's move. Secretary, read the caption. Senator Bill 284 by Senator Walker, the 20th and others built to be telemetry. I'm chapter 5 of the 10 of the OCGA, the Georgia Uniform Security Act 2008. So, I authorized the assurance of orders by the Commissioner of Security, directing persons who have violated certain securities provisions to return to investors, customers, or clients, sums paid in connection with securities purchases, and for other purposes. That can be seen by the vice president. Is there objection? No objection. No objection. Secretary, finish the caption, please. Senator Bill 284 by Senator Walker, the 20th and others built to be telemetry. I'm chapter 5 of the 10 of the OCGA, the Georgia Uniform Security Act 2008, and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor recommends that this bill do pass, respectfully submit, Senator Walker, Chairman, and that committee see order. Mr. President. I'm recognized as a nature boy from the front of the 20th. There you are, Walker. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. I know the hour's late, and y'all are in hurry. I'm in hurry, but when I was a young man, I used to go see Mr. Wrestling Number 2, and they make in Coliseum. He wasn't there as entertaining or as dynamic as the nature boy. Mr. Ric Flair. I do have a couple of Ric Flair quotes for you real quick. He was often would say, to be the man, you got to beat the man. And some of you all might could learn from that. He was a style and profile in limousine, rod and jet flying, kissed Dealing, Wheeling and Dealing, son of a gun, Mr. Ric Flair. Senate Bill 284 has to do with security fraud and provides an additional penalty that can be used to resolve these cases. So in the event that a person is found to have violated chapter 5 of the Georgia Uniform Security's Act, under current law, the penalties can be a cease and desist order, denial, revocation or conditioning of the license to operate in Georgia, and or civil penalties that would be remitted to the state of Georgia and go into the general fund, and the civil penalties can be a minimum of 5,000, I think, up to 50,000 for a single violation, with a maximum of 500,000 for more than one violation. That all goes to the general fund. There's no ability to restore the laws to the defrauded citizens of Georgia. So Senate Bill and lines 26 through 32 add the ability to require the return of the invested funds to the defrauded investors. I thank you so good measure to protect Georgians and I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. The senator is yielded. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board of Committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the pass to the bill. All those in favor vote, yay. All opposed, nay. Secretary, on line of the machine. Thank you. I'll only depend on the bill, the yay's are feet before the nays are won. This bill haven't received recliction. Constitution majority is there for pass. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd ask unanimous consent to move Senate bill 129 from the table. Senate bill 129 by Senate Albers of the 56 and others. The bill to be titled on act to amend part one of Article 2, Chapter 5, Title 48 of the OCGA will lead to property tax exemptions. So it's to increase the amount of the statewide home exemption for certain totally disabled veterans to create new statewide home exemptions for certain partially disabled veterans and partially are totally disabled first responders, right for definitions, right for related matters, right for compliance with constitutional requirements, right for short title, right for referendum effective dates and automatic repeal to repeal the looking lots and rather purple. This bill is looking lots and rather purposes, Mr. President, I complete the order. Is there objection, objection, Secretary, finish the caption. Senate bill 129 by Senate Albers of the 56 and others. The bill to be titled on act to amend part one of Article 2, Chapter 5, Title 48 of the OCGA will lead to property tax exemptions and rather purposes. Mr. President, Senate Committee on Finance recommends that this bill do pass by substitute respectfully, Senate Senator House, Statler, Chairman. Mr. President, Senate Quinty on finance offers the following substitute to Senate bill 129 and bill to be entitled to amend part one of Article 2, Chapter 5, Title 48 of the OCGA will lead to property tax exemptions and rather purposes. Mr. President, fiscal notes, the Senate bill 129 has been attached. I complete the order, Mr. President. We're going to send it from the 56. Good evening. We've worked very hard today. We've had a bit of fun, but I'm going to ask for your attention on a very serious matter. Senate bill 121 is a way for each one of us to express our unwavering support. For all of us who've served this and our community overseas, the Georgia supporting those who sacrifice for service act. This legislation is not just a bill. It's an expression of the gratitude and respect we owe to the men and women who have risked their lives to protect our community and nation. Some of them serve and work in this very capital building. Specifically, this aims to augment the statewide homestead exemption for our totally disabled veterans and create new exemptions for our partially disabled veterans as well as our first responders. Our veterans and first responders have shown extraordinary courage and selflessness in their line of duty. They have faced danger, endured hardships, and made personal sacrifices that most cannot even comprehend. And when they return home from overseas or from their shift, it's our duty to ensure they are not burdened by the financial hardships on top of the physical and emotional scars they may bear. This proposal increases the homestead exemption for our totally disabled veterans as well as will ease the burden on those brave individuals who have given so much who are partially disabled. It also adds a new exemption for our first responders in the same vein. It is a small token to the immense gratitude of their service. By extending this, we recognize the sacrifices a broader group of individuals have made for us. They have defended our liberty and our freedom both at home and abroad. This bill does more than just provide financial relief. It sends a clear message to our veterans and first responders that their sacrifices are not forgotten. It tells them that we as a state recognize their service and are committed to their well-being. It also sends a clear message to those who are currently serving and who seek to service in the future that we will have there back. This bill also provides for a referendum allowing the citizens of Georgia the opportunity to express their support for our veterans and first responders. It's this type of a process that will ensure that it's a true reflection of the people. Let me be clear, this is not a handout. It is yet a way that the people of Georgia can give back to those who have given so much. It's a small gesture of thanks for the enormous sacrifices most will never comprehend. We must remember that they have paid a high price for their service. The Georgia supporting those who sacrifice for service act as a crucial step toward acknowledging and supporting our disabled veterans and first responders. It's a testament to our gratitude. Home properties have risen at an extraordinary rate over the last many years. And this is one way we'll be able to help have our veterans and first responders who've been disabled to buy that first home or be able to afford to stay in their current home. The Georgia supporting those who have been disabled to buy that first home or be able to afford to stay in their current home or be able to afford to stay in their current home.

There are 21,000 first responders who are suffering some type of disability from an on-the-job accident, representing less than two-tenths of 1% of our state's population. Currently there are 49,000 fully disabled veterans who have received a partial deduction on their homeowner's property taxes, which will go to fully. And there is a total of another 176,000 people eligible with a partial disability representing 1.5% of our population. So as you can imagine, this is a small percentage of our population, but no one more deserving, and it will be impactful to them to their family and ways that we cannot measure. Senators I'm going to urge each one of you to join me now in supporting this important piece of legislation. Let's stand together in backing this bill, affirming our commitment to our veterans and our first responders, and ensuring that Georgia remains a state that truly honors those who sacrifice for us, our heroes. With that, Mr. President, I'll yield for questions or I'll yield the well. You do have one question. Recognize the senate from the 26th. Senator Yew, I yield. Senator I understand what you're doing. Well, what is the, what does the future fiscal note look like for this? I'm sorry, Senator, could you read the question? I said what does the future fiscal note looks like for this? There is not a fiscal note because it does not impact state revenue, it impacts local revenue. As mentioned earlier, though, out of the 21,000 first responders that will qualify for this, that represents a little less than 2% of the Georgia population. And out of the current total disabled veterans, which number 49,000 have taken the exemption, there's a potential of 176,000 more that have a partial disability that could claim that, and that would be a percentage off of their home owner's property taxes based on the percentage of disability, that represents approximately 1.5% of the population. Senator, we can talk about population, but when you're dealing with taxes in New York County, or you'll see it, it has an impact. So, were you able to get an approximate, how much money it would cost? Senator, based on not knowing where every veteran and first responder resides today, we weren't able to get an exact amount. However, knowing the percentage is so small, I believe it is insignificant and also knowing what great community leaders and neighbors are first responders and our veterans are. We believe they'll be giving that back at least 10 fold. Do you have another question? We're going to have Senator from the, okay, she's turned off. You weigh Senator from 36. Actually, you weigh, you have no more questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, we did a lot of great things today. I think this would be a great way to finish our evening by supporting those who sacrificed us. Thank you. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair has done the previous question is ordered. The questions are on the adoption of the committee. Substitute, is there objections to the adoption of the committee? Substitute. Hearing none, the committee isων adopted. Is there objections to the agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair has done the board of committee has agreed to. Is there an objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute, all those in favor of vote, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, and a lot of machine. you everywhere. On the pass of the bill, the yeas are 56. May there is zero. This bill seems to be the constitution of the majority. Therefore, pass by substitute. I am going to ask the pro-tum for a motion. Thank you, Mr. President. I move to excuse the senator from the 48th for consideration of voting on the next bill on the calendar, please. I'm Jackson, sitting from the 48th Excuse. I recognize the senator from the 21st for a motion. We've set it bill 244 from the table. Secretary of the caption. We will do 24 by senator Beecher, 21st and others. We intend to enact a manor. We will do 17 of the official bill. We will do two general provisions regarding the assessment and payment of costs of criminal proceedings. We will provide for the award of reasonable attorneys fees and costs any criminal case to defend it. We will make a successful motion to disqualify the prosecuting attorney from his conduct and connection with the case to write for procedures for assessing and paying such fees and costs. We will do two general provisions regarding the assessment and payment of costs of criminal proceedings and other purposes. Mr. President, Senator Gishe, I recommend that this bill do pass or reflect its minutes on a striclin chairman. Mr. President, Senator Beecher, 21st, office of the following amendment number 1 to amend Senate bill 244 by deleting lines 23 to 26 by replacing D on line 27 with C by replacing E on line 33 with D. Mr. President, I complete the order. I recognize the senator from the 21st. Mr. President, I bring before you Senate bill 244. Basically what this bill does is if a prosecuting attorney is in a felony or misdemeanour case is disqualified for misconduct and the overall case is dismissed by the court system, the court of appeals or Supreme Court, then those individuals that were indicted are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and cost incurred in defending themselves in the case. The judge in that case will consider the request of reasonable attorney fees and cost and the fees will be paid by the county in which the criminal case was brought. That's all this bill does. I'll yield for questions, Mr. President, and I will yield the well. There are no questions. Okay, the senator from the 22nd will speak to the amendment. It's a friendly amendment which I agree to and he will speak to the amendment in my order. Thank you. The senator from the 22nd will speak to the amendment. So I speak to the amendment also to the bill, Mr. President, so on the bill as was stated, I know a lot of people may think they understand the genesis of this, but I want you to also think about this particular situation. We're up here at a young man, a woman who was charged with a crime, had to hire a lawyer for $15,000, $20,000. The prosecutor was basically removed for improper conduct. Case gets dismissed. What kind of resolution does that person have? They have nothing. They're out that $15,000, $20,000. What this case says is that what this bill says is if that situation happens, if you have that young person, possession of marijuana, whatever it may be, and the prosecutor has done something wrong, and if that case is dismissed because the prosecutor did something wrong, they're entitled to have their attorneys fees back. And that's actually something that we probably would have pushed many years ago. The amendment basically takes out line 23-27 because that amendment, that line says that if you still go to trial, no matter whether you're found guilty or not guilty, as long as you go to trial, if the prosecutor was dismissed, you still get your attorney's fees. Here's the problem with that. A person may go to trial, the prosecutor may have been dismissed. Whatever was wrong with the case got cured. They go to trial, the person is found guilty, they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of a crime, they then could steal them possibly get attorney's fees. So they are sitting in jail getting a government check because the prosecutor was dismissed, but at the same time, whatever that dismiss was based on, that got cured, the case went to trial, the person was found guilty. So we eliminated that part because the intent was if the case was dismissed because of the prosecutor's wrongdoing, a person should be able to receive compensation for that.

Today, I have legislation that asked the Georgia Department of Corrections to provide inmates upon release with relevant documentation to assist in inmates and their post-release employment. The bill asks for certain documentation to be provided to the inmates to assist them with obtaining post-release employment. The documentation includes what is not limited to notification to the inmate if he is she is eligible to apply for an occupational license or certificate. A copy of the inmates' work record or certified copy of the inmates birth certificate is so security card. A copy of vocational training, a resume, including any trade learned by the inmate document documentation that the inmate completed a practice job interview. The bill asks that the Department of Corrections coordinate with the Department of Driver Services to provide the inmates with a state issued identification card or a valid driver's license card if needed. There is a friendly amendment from the senator from the 50th that I have no problem with and I want to thank him for his help. And Mr. President, if there's no questions, I yield.

What it says is if a release requests these documentation, the Department of Corrections shall provide them. However, they have to be an eligible person.
