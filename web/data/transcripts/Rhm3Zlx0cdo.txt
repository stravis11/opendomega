TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well, thank you all first of all for being here today. I appreciate that.
In the 2026 legislative session, I will introduce legislation to take the Georgia State income tax rate to zero.
Let me repeat that for you one time. During the Georgia 2026 legislative session, I will introduce legislation to take Georgia's income tax rate to zero.
This may not happen overnight, but I'm committed to delivering on this goal in a way that protects
our state's core priorities, health care, education, infrastructure and public safety.
My mission is simple, eliminate Georgia's income tax and its entirety.
And over the next several months, I will chair study committees, work closely with my
colleagues, and of course consult with Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones to chart a realistic
and responsible path to eliminate Georgia's income tax.
Let me be clear, my role as chair is not to debate whether we do
away with the state income tax, it's to determine how we will do
away with the state income tax.
Georgia's state income tax was started roughly 80 years ago
during the Great Depression, and for a large part of that time,
it remained at 6% largely unquestioned.
It's only been in the past decade under Republican leadership
that we've seen that percentage rate finally begin to trickle down.
And while that's progress, it's just a start.
Because we don't operate in a vacuum, you see our neighboring states like North Carolina
and South Carolina are quickly working to reduce their state income tax.
And nine states in our nation have already completely done away with theirs.
And these aren't just red states and they're not just blue states.
You've got Wyoming, Washington, New Hampshire, Texas, Tennessee, and of course Florida.
And when folks mention Florida, the first thing they do is say, well, that's because of
tourism, but tourism doesn't explain how Tennessee did it.
And it doesn't explain how New Hampshire did it.
And while some credits will warn you that doing away with the state income tax will be catastrophic,
I want to point out that all those states that have already done away with the state income
tax, none of them are clamoring to create one.
You see, this is about competitiveness.
It's about economic freedom.
And above all, it's about allowing hardworking Georgians to keep their money in their pockets.
It's about you keeping your money in your pockets.
I believe Georgia can get this done.
And I'm not gonna stop until we do.
And I'm happy to take any of your questions.
Some of the things you mentioned
that I'll test it all so that I have a higher self-experts
that I can have in the hard work,
who is the one back of the other.
Yeah, I think that if you are moving from one text
to another, which again, I'm not gonna set that
as the premise yet of, that's what we're gonna do.
But if you are, you're obviously gonna be looking
that are you widening or broadening your tax base?
If you're bringing more people through,
like those who are traveling from Tennessee to Florida,
and they're helping pay Georgia's former state income tax,
I think that's a win for Georgians.
Well, if you do away with one stream,
you're making it less diverse,
but you're not doing away with all streams.
If you had nine streams to begin with and now you've moved to eight, we'll have to ask
the credit agencies how they feel about diversity that remains.
But again, I can't accept that as the premise when we still are in the process of developing
how we will get this done.
Yeah, a little awful in that number, it's $16.2 billion in revenue if you look at our
numbers.
You also look at our sales tax numbers.
It brings in $9 billion, right?
4% brings in nine.
You could be looking at those items,
but I think we're premature to jump out
and talk about that yet.
Remember, we've got a study committee that's set up.
We have a lieutenant governor
who's brought his ideas to the table.
So I think it would be a little unfair
for me to prejudice the committee
by telling you what the chair thinks that we should do
before we hear from the other members
of the committee to do that.
My thoughts on this process are well known.
I'm not new to the idea of doing away
with the state income tax when I was chairman of the county commission we reduced property
taxes every year I was there.
This is my positions are well documented and you don't have to look too far in the records
of your different articles to see this.
I don't think that 2026 is necessarily the year that you finalize it as I said I don't
think this happens overnight.
My goal would be that we move in this direction.
You've seen us move in this direction over the past three years.
I think that this is the year that we show that we are going to go to zero.
It's not a debate anymore about if we go to zero.
The question now is how we go to zero.
I think some people will make that argument, but I would go to those families who were
paying that state income tax and ask them if they could would be happy with a 5% increase
in just keeping their own money.
We could literally give them a 5% pay increase by simply allowing them to keep the money
they've already earned.
Yeah, I think the committee, the committee's work will start immediately.
There are provisions of Senate rules that don't require it to go away.
On December 15th, we set a deadline for the reasons that I think most businesses set
deadlines.
You know, you got a date to get something done by.
Now, I am glad for that deadline.
I know that there is an extension.
I don't want to have to hit it.
Well, clearly, we would want to hear
from the nine states that have already done this.
They're not clamoring to create one.
So they've done this in a way that was able to be
fruitful for their citizens.
We want to study their ideas.
There are national brands that are tackling the same issue.
This is not something that's even,
this just Georgia centric,
or even just southeastern centric.
I think it's a national odd movement,
and it's one that we'll be able to tap into.
So there's not seats on the bed.
For the probability that we'll go all the time soon,
being on sale today for the taxes to fall in the lower,
but the lower percent of the units
I think that if you're dealing with nine states, 20% of all the states in the nation that
you're going to have some on the high side and some on the low side, I don't think that
you're going to see, look at a state like South Dakota, I don't think anyone's saying
that their cost of living or their taxes overall are high and they've done away with their
state income tax.
Now, New Hampshire, Washington State, probably on the opposite ends, not sure we're going
I don't want to copy their ideas, but we have plenty of ideas to choose from.
I do think again that it's way premature for me to prejudice the committee about saying
the ideas that the chair thinks he supports.
You know those very clearly already.
I believe that we can handle this through things that you've already reported.
the members of the committee there on the committee for a reason to bring their ideas
and clearly also we want to hear from the lieutenant governor his ideas as he's obviously
made this a major part of his policy platform.
I think Georgia can lay out a plan to be at zero in 2026, a plan that we will reach zero.
It does not mean that the state income tax is zero in 2026, but the plan to reach zero
I believe can be finalized in 2026.
Is anything else? Thank you. I appreciate y'all a lot. Have a good one.
