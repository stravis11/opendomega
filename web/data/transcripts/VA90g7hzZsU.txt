Thank you, Mr. Chair, I asked that this House consider the agreement in agreed to the Senate
substitute for House Bill 865 and that LC number is 412549S.
Representative Skoggins has moved that this House agreed to the Senate substitute to
House Bill 865, the clerk will read the caption.
865 to be titled an act to amend title 53 of the Fisher go to Georgia annotated relating
to Will's trust and administration of the states to amend part 12 of article 1 of chapter
1 of title 7 of the Fisher go to Georgia annotated relating deposits of deceased depositors.
Chair recognizes representative Skoggins to explain his motion.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This bill is a Code Revision bill for wheels in the State Title 53.
The Senate made a couple of changes to the bill.
The two changes are the two changes that they made were that a 30-day notice be required
when notifying a trustee of a hearing.
The other change was they made a domestic relations and obligation to this title, which
would be like Alamone, each I'll support those types of things.
That's the only two changes they made to the bill.
The original bill was voted on back in March, and this bill just changes a few things.
The bill hadn't been changed since 1998, and this bill changed a little bit of the jurisdiction
with the probate judges.
This allowed non-article six probate judges to do DNA testing on bodies to determine
theirs. Article 6, courts which are attorneys and they can have jury trials. They already
had the jurisdiction, but we changed the code to allow non-logger judges to do the same.
If there's any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.
I do not think you have any questions.
I yield well.
On the gentleman's motion that this House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill
865, all those in favor will vote aye, those opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock
the machines.

So it's to provide for development of a statewide strategic transportation plan
chair recognizes representative
Carpenter to explain the Senate substitute
All right guys. Thanks for having me today. I can honestly say the Senate actually made this bill better simple bill
Basically, it streamlines government as far as reporting goes on the state transportation
plan that the GDOT does every year.
They added some pieces to protect billboards if they're moved in acquisitions or if noise
bears are put up in your community and it affects a billboard.
It allows a billboard to be able to be reset and then there's also a piece in here about
Protecting your businesses when acquisitions occur and I yield for any questions

Chair recognizes Chairman Dempsey for a motion.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
I move that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 993 as amended in
the Senate.
Our DEMPSE has moved that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 993 of the clerk will read the caption.
House Bill 993 to be entitled back to amend chapter 10 of Title 31 of the official code of Georgia and it's ended relating a viable record so it's to provide for viable record reports and data from the state registrar relating to child abuse reports.
Chair recognizes representative DEMPSE to explain the Senate substitute.
Thank you, HB993 left our house with unanimous support, a simple data sharing agreement
between the Department of Public Health and Department of Family and Children's Services,
Department of Human Services to share very important vital records.
When it left, the Senate added a measure to repeal the child abuse registry.
They did say because it is duplicative, and because with that, as recognized in their
budget and the one we will all see very soon, there was a line on them saving of $975,000.
This same information can be garnered through the SHIN system, which is an existing internal
administrative system.
It is supported by defects, by together Georgia, the prosecuting attorneys, and unanimously,
As I said, left here and was unanimously voted through the Senate as well.
If there are any questions, I'll be glad to take them.
If not, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable support.
Are there questions?
Seeing none on the general, on the ladies' motion that the House agreed to the Senate substitute
to House Bill 993.
All those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines.
