TRANSCRIPT
----------
268 as amended by the Senate, and we will agree to accept to as amended by the Senate.
I think everyone has that. Now someone recognize
Representative Persinger for a motion. Representative Persinger.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I moved the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to HB 268.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House bill 268 by Representative Persinger of the 119th to be entitled back to men chapter two titled 20 the fish go to Georgia and
it related to elementary and secondary education so as to provide for the safety health and well-being of students and school communities.
Thank you Mr. Speaker I know the hours late so I'll be brief and just go over the changes that were made.
The Senate substitute incorporates SB 17 known as Ricky and Alyssa's Law and its entirety that will require all public schools to implement a mobile panic alert system.
Much like the one used at Appalachia that we know saved countless lives and
prevented as much a much larger tragedy. This will also require each school to
be curi-digital mapping data to be shared with the state and local agencies
that respond to emergencies and school systems. The amended 268 also requires
GMA and Homeland Security to establish a statewide alert system to report and
monitor incidents of safety threats made against schools. It will also require
our schools to adopt threat assessment plans,
providing a structured and multidisciplinary process
to identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats
to schools while supporting the safety and well-being
of students and school personnel.
Bill also creates a qualified student advocacy specialist
position who's required to coordinate mental health
services for students in crisis,
and it also creates the grants to fund those positions.
Colleagues, after what we witnessed at Appalachian, this house committed to
champion legislation to bolster school security, mandate stronger
communications between our schools and provide critical mental health resources
to our students. That's exactly what House Bill 268 will accomplish and I ask
for your favor. Consideration is bill.
Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. Yes, sir.
Phil Yeild. Yes, sir.
Representative Roberts to your left has recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, just gentlemen yield.
I do.
I'm all for all of these security measures.
I just am curious on the, was it a listless law,
the mapping that is required to be implemented by,
I think it was July of 2026?
Is there funding in the budget for that
or those school systems?
I have no idea what they cost.
I just wonder if we're imposing an unfunded man
they don't have schools with quick turnaround time.
I think most of the mapping is already required
the school safety plans we did. I believe in 23. Okay. So it's just in addition to. Okay. Thank you.
Gentlemen, you are for another question. I do.
We're going to be in it.
To your left is recognize for question. Thank you with the gentleman you. I do.
You mentioned a mental health personnel. Is that per each school or for the school district?
I wasn't I couldn't find it in the bill. So it was originally in our bill as a behavioral
a health coordinator and that's going to be allocated based on population. I believe
it's 18,000, update 18,000 get one that we would fund through grants of 18,000 to 36,000
would have two and over 36,000 students would get up to three that would be funded by the
grants that we put in the budget. If they want to have more, they could have more. They
I've set the fund in themselves.
Participant.
Correct.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, you have another question?
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
Reps of the barns to your left is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Gentlemen, you'll.
I will.
As far as the school safety devices,
are they to be placed per classroom,
like the alert system?
That is the alert system that we use here at the Capitol.
Same thing as the alert bathroom.
Are we trying to place those in each classroom?
That's what I'm asking.
Wait, which alert system you speak?
Tell me about Alyssa's law or the one
that GEMA is responsible for?
I guess the GEMA's law that we're gonna implement
and put in each classroom.
Are we putting these alert systems in each classroom
or just in the school?
No, that's information sharing to make sure
that if there is a credible threat to a school system
that all agencies are involved in that communication.
That was part of the lacking in Appalachian.
So the other system that you were explaining
is the actual device?
Correct, the device in a list of laws
is the panic alert badges like we have here.
OK, and they will go to each teacher or something
like that or student.
Correct, most systems are using that.
I think if I'm not mistaken, we have about 80%,
maybe a little less than that compliance.
All right, thank you.
Yep.
Gentlemen, you hear from another question.
One more.
Reptility buttoner to your left has recognized for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
I will.
There was a great deal of conversation
after what happened in Winder and Appalachia School.
And one of the things that they were talking about
is that the student had only been there very briefly
and that the records from the previous school
that may have given an indication
of a potential problem had not arrived.
So when it talks about procedures
to meet the requirements and student's education records
in a timely manner, is timely mannered identified?
Within five days.
Okay, thank you very much.
Gentlemen, you yield or one more question, is he?
One more.
are rips that you sent you as is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, this is Jim and you.
No, will.
So the G3 databases removed from this bill
that would pass from the house or.
The S3 databases removed correct.
Okay, for the yield.
Yes.
But the bill still includes disciplinary records
following students if they have a disciplinary record
from school to school correct.
Correct, that's currently in a student's record now
and follows a student now just not,
there's not anything codified as to the time frame.
So we're codifying that a student's record, which currently exists, must be transferred
within five days.
Great.
Thank you.
Speaker, I yield the well.
Gentlemen has answered questions presented the bill and then you were the well.
All the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 268.
All those in favor will vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no.
Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
of
members voted, if so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machines.
On the Generalist's motion, the years are 154, the days are 12, and this house has agreed
to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 268, the School Safety Bill.
Congratulations, Rhapsody Perslinger.
Applause
Thank you members.
Mr. Clerk, well you read the caption to Senate Bill 199, 199.
Senate bill 199 by Senator Watson of the 11th being titled not to amend chapter 5 or title 21 of the official go to Georgia and attend it relating to government transparency and campaign finance.
So it's required that the State Ethics Commission shall not accept the reject complaints made against candidate 60 days prior to an election.
This bill em for the committee on government affairs that committee recommends this bill do pass.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I have for you Senate Bill 199, which provides
a much needed uniformity in terms of our campaign finance disclosures, and also streamlines
and simplifies some of our reporting requirements.
I want to thank Mr. David Amadi, who was in the gallery with us right now, our State Ethics
Commissioner Commissioner Executive Director for his input on this
legislation. This is a clean bill. No amendments. It passes in it without a single
no vote. I think you're like it as well. Let me tell you about some of the
key provisions. Local filings now done with city and county. Election clerks will
now be reverted back to the state starting January 1st, 2027. It makes the
deadline 60 days prior to an election to submit complaints against the
candidate for election, currently at 30,
changes campaign disclosure reports to quarterly every year
and provides uniformity of both election years
and non-election years.
And those days will be standard across the board.
January 31st, April 30th, July 31st, and October 20th.
And also changes reporting for PACs,
political action committees to those dates as well.
So uniformity across reporting dates.
It also requires PACs to have separate bank accounts,
much like campaigns. It moves financial
to closures reports to be due on April
first every year instead of different
days and a non-election year. Again,
making it clear find the situation
making it more simple. It also requires
our friends outside on the ropes to
make their reports once a month no
later than the fifth day of the month
and also simplifies lobbyist
registrations. One of the last things
I'll kind of talk about is also
restricts elected officials and candidates for office
homeless dress from public view.
So it does a good bit of things, makes things more uniform,
stand it across the board, Mr. Speaker,
I'll stand for any questions.
You have a couple of questions,
Representative Stacy Evans, to your left,
just recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield?
I yield.
I think there's definitely more good in this building,
but I did have a question I wanted to ask you about
online 5.72, I guess really starting on 5.71
where we are talking about financial statements.
Say, amen, when you have it.
Nobody got my job.
So, two.
What?
Yeah, no, I was I was are you there. I didn't want to start yet. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Garden in the thousand but not more than 2,500.
Well starting this that whole section starting online 571 through 581 where we are.
We're having this part of the bill appears to me sets out the requirements for.
and it may just be the statewide candidates
for their financial statements.
My question is, we've got a lot of compression
at the beginning when you're setting out,
when candidates are setting out their income
or what they might hold in something,
not more than 1,000, then we've got between 1,000 and 2,500,
2,500 and 5,000, 15,000.
Really tiny, relatively tiny ranges,
but then we are like 500,000 to a million,
a million to five million,
the greater than five million.
So I'm having a hard time understanding why
there's more interest in knowing whether a candidate owns
between 1,000 and 15,000,
but not knowing whether it was 5,000,000,000,
100,000, 200,000, 500,000,
we're just letting that go as high as the sky can go.
And I was wondering if that was discussed
and what perhaps was the logic there?
I can't speak to that exactly.
I just know that it was creating ranges
for personal financial disclosure statements
on a source of income instead of exact amounts.
That's secondized law can give you
in terms of the reasoning behind that.
Perhaps that's something that could be looked at
because I think from a transparency standpoint,
there's not a lot to be gained between the range of,
to me, 1,000 to 15,000, maybe even 50,
but there's a lot to know between 5,500 million
and we're leaving that to chance.
Would you yield for one more?
I will.
I understand the logic of not having the Ethics Commission
accept or decline a complaint during the 60 days
before an election.
I actually thought that was the law already.
But what happens to those?
Because they're very well maybe some wrongdoing
that needs to be brought to someone's attention.
And will those just sit?
or do they have to be filed again after the elections over?
I will find out, but the intent with that
is not to have a surprise, you know,
semi-logic complaint issue that close to an election timeline.
I think it backs that timeline up,
so we can have more time between those dates and the election,
but I will find out, get back to you.
Could you tell me though, well, not the logic in that,
I'm wondering what happens to the complaints.
The commission's not gonna accept them or reject them.
I see the motion from the executive director saying
going to go back to after the election. So you would have to refile it after the election.
That's correct. No, you don't. You don't have to refile it, but you could.
They roll over. So they're still heard, but after the election.
Understood. And I guess if you would yield a little bit further, have a little discussion
here. If one more question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I understand it's great logic not to
give a campaign fodder to say a complaint's been filed or the ethics commission is considering
this complaint and that goes on a mailer within 60 days of the campaign but are we actually
taking that away because if they file it and it's not accepted or rejected it seems
like it would still be accurate for the complaining candidate within those 60 days to say ethics
complaint has been filed against X, Y, Z. Is that would that be accurate if the
candidate said that? I'm not sure I can speak to that just I think we're just
trying to basically make some uniformity and simplicity to the timeline. Thank
you. Thank you. May not comply with state law but I bet you it'll be said about
somebody. Ripsney Bertchette. Whip Bertchette is recognized for a question. Thank
Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield to the whip?
Did I understand you to say that this is going to simplify our filing so that even in election
years and non-election years, we're filing quarterly, is that correct?
That's correct.
So we don't have this three days provision like we've got right now.
The alternate seven between seven and fifteen days are non-election years.
It makes it standard April 1st, I believe.
Thank you.
you. You want another question? Mr. Speaker and the voice of Deputy Welp, Mr. Speaker,
I will yield the well. The gentleman's yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here it none, the previous
question is ordered. Is there any objection to a green to the report of the committee which
was favorable to the passage of the bill.
Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to.
Shout this bill now, pass all in favor of the passage of the bill.
We'll vote yes, all those opposed.
We'll vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?

The Nays are one.
This bill, having you see the requisite constitutional majority,
is there for the past.
Members in your folder, your agree-disagree folder,
we have Senate substitute to House Bill 288.
So that's what we're going to take up next.
Representative Gaines is recognized for a motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute
to House Bill 288.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 288 to be entitled back to amend
Article 2, Chapter 6, and Title 5, Chapter 4,
Title 9, Article 1, and Chapter 18, and Title 15,
and Chapter 16, and Title 17, of the Fiscal Court of Georgia
and attended, relating to a public practice.
We're upset that Houston Gaines recognized to explain his motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
A House bill 288 in terms of the 288 did not change in the Senate.
It was combined with House bill 246, which was a bill that passed unanimously out of house committee here in the chamber.
These are both pro law enforcement bills that will help 288 is to ensure that if a district attorney accuses a law enforcement officer of credibility issues,
they have the opportunity to clear their name
and this morning the Senate passed this bill unanimously.
Ms. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer questions.
There is one.
To your right, Representative Jason Ridley
has recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, this is my friend, Yieldon.
I think so.
On the end of the line, 8 to 18 and 2 to 19,
could you explain to me what a jiggle-o list is
and why I'm not on it?
It's a giggly-o list.
Oh, giggly-o, okay.
Thank you.
We'll clear that up.
different string. I hope you're not on that other list, but
Mr. Speaker on that one I'll yield the will.
Sometimes I'm sorry I recognize people for questions.
On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate
substitute
to House bill 288.
All those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, were you in a lot the machines have all members voted
have all members voted if so miss clerk were you locked the machines all the
gentleman's motion the yeas are 152 the nasa port to this house agreed to
the Senate substitute to House Bill 288.
Back on the rules, calendar.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate Bill 201?
201.
Senate Bill 201 by Senator Walker, the 20th and others to be titled.
an act to amend Code Section 10-1-393 for the fiscal to Georgia annotator relating non-fair
deceptive practices and consumer transactions, unlawful examples.
This bill I've referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.
The lady from Lyons, Representative Hagen, is recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Friends, typically after a natural disaster, we tend to see the best in people, but sadly
on some occasions, we do see the worst in people.
Most recently, after Hurricane Helene, we saw scammers in the form of storm chasing repair
contractors who suddenly appear to make home repairs.
And I'm sure you've seen them in other instances
of natural disasters around the state.
They show up and claim to be ready to make repairs.
However, they often are praying on our senior citizens
and potentially others of us who are not particularly well
versed in contractual language.
So many people who are in a time of intense stress
because of the natural disaster sign contracts
for home repairs more quickly than they would have otherwise
without fully understanding what they're signing.
So this bill would do two things to address this.
First, it amends the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act
to provide greater protection for homeowners
in the 12 months following a natural disaster
to make sure that contracted work is performed
in a timely and professional manner.
And the second thing that this bill does is prohibit the assignment of insurance proceeds to contractors for a period of one year following the natural disaster.
So what it does is it gives homeowners who are in a time of intense stress the ability to cancel their contract if the contractor does not perform as they should.
It only applies within the 12 months after a natural disaster in a county that was included
in a state of emergency proclamation by the governor.
And right now this includes every county in the state because we have had these natural
disasters, state of emergency proclamations statewide for winter storms, hurricanes within
the past 12 months.
Although it was a concern, immediately following the hurricane and this bill did come out of those concerns.
It is written in such a way that it would apply to any county who has within the last 12 months been declared a state of emergency due to a natural disaster.
Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and I'd be happy to take some questions if there are any.
Lady has no questions.
Thank you.
I ask for your favorable consideration.
Ladies, yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here in another previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Here in another committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Here in another report, the committee's agreed to, shall.
This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill.
We'll vote yes, all those opposed.
We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
Have all members voted for what purpose does Chairman Deloge rise?
Power men are incorrect, Mr. Speaker.
Stay dead inquiry.
Since our friend from Tim's mentioned that this bill was particularly beneficial to old
people, should I ask to be excused from this vote?
You would be if you were old, but you're not old, but the next guy that matches button,
Chairman Hitchens may have fit that bill, but you don't.
So I think you're clear to vote.
Have all members now voted?
Youngies, you feel right, Mr. Chairman?
Have all members of the vote of this, though,
the clerk will lock the machine,
own the passage of Senate Bill 201-201.
The Yays are 163 and Mays 1,
the Bill Henry, the requisite constitutional majority
is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you be decaptioned to Senate Bill 130?
130.
Senate Bill 130 by Senator Hodges, the third to be entitled to amend Title 31 of the
the official code of Georgia Antietta,
relating to health shows to expand medical education,
funding, and the service,
cancelable loan programs.
Bill haven't referred to the committee on health.
That committee recommends this bill do pass.
Representative Townsend is recognized to present the bill.
Representative Townsend.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Senate Bill 130 increases health care providers.
That's the goal.
Increases number of institutions offering residency
and fellowship programs within the state.
At its final year, residents and fellows
to the Georgia Board of Healthcare Workforce,
Conservation Loan Program.
If this should increase real healthcare providers
in the area that track more fellows
and residents in that area.
Helps keep spine your residents and fellows in Georgia,
especially underserved communities.
This usually requires healthcare providers
to commit to working in the underserved areas
at least five years to repay the loan debt.
This applies to, of course,
PAs, physicians, dentists, and advance, or ends.
Mr. Speaker, that's just to the bill.
I can be glad to answer any questions.
Representative Park Cannon, do you live?
Does recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, do you yield?
Yes.
I'm looking at lines 103 through 105 on page five
Five of this measure.
Yes.
Was this provision already necessary for someone
to be a citizen or a US national?
Or is this new language?
From what I can tell, it's new language since it's underlined.
That's the best one I've read, this new language.
OK, and further.
You said 103 to 105, correct?
Correct.
Yes, that should be new language.
OK, so what's the legal reason?
What's the metric for making this be only available to citizens at this time?
I'd have to guess on that when the best thing I could say was to kind of
gear it toward the citizens of the United States of America at this time.
Gentlemen, ask no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you able to well?
Gentlemen, do you order the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
hearing none the previous questions ordered is any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill
hearing none the report of the committee's agreed to shall this bill now pass
all in favor of the passage of the bill we'll vote yes all those opposed we'll
vote no and mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine
have all members voted for what purposes represent the rice rise.
Parliamentary quarry.
State your inquiry.
Mr. Speaker, is it not true that Senate Bill 130 strengthened the storage of health care
systems by incentivizing medical professionals to remain in our state and serve in communities
that need the most?
The lady knows what she speaks, because that's one of the goals of this house.
Have all members now voted, all members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine.
On the passage of Senate Bill 130, the yeas are 155, the nays are seven.
This bill, having to see the requisite Constitution majority, is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, where you read the caption to Senate Bill 99, Senate Bill 99.
Senate Bill 99, Senator Roberts of the 29th and others to be entitled now to men code section 16,
one, three of the official code of Georgia and it's had a really definitions relative to crimes and offenses.
So it's to provide for a definition of a law enforcement officer.
This bill has been referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Her representative Matt Reeves has recognized to present the bill, representative Reeves.
Thank you Speaker Burns and members of the House I present to you Senate bill 99 the Law
Enforcement Partners Act and although this has a Senate bill designation this has house
language the House Committee on Public Safety worked on this this year twice once with
the House bill when the Senate bill passed 49 to one I talked to the Senate sponsor and
he agreed to work on our House version that the Georgia Sheriff's Association and the
House Public Safety Committee had made some revisions too so we had a second hearing and
the committee passed it out on a bipartisan basis.
George is one of two states,
Nebraska being the other one that lacks
a jurisdictional basis for the federal authorities
to work with our state authorities
in cases of disaster upon state requests
with a joint task force.
That was an inadvertent repeal five years ago.
This bill would fix it and I really appreciate
the House members and public safety working so hard
on this on a bipartisan basis to present this bill,
which I request your favorable support of.
and I yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker.
If there are no questions, I yield the well.
You have a couple of questions.
Representative Reese to your left and the back.
Representative Teddy Reese.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
There's the gentleman you?
Absolutely, from my colleague from Columbus,
who I've talked about this with a lot.
So you're gonna take my inquiry from it in, huh?
Absolutely.
Okay.
I do wanna thank you for bringing this bill.
And isn't it true that this bill will allow
our local sheriff officers to have the necessary federal tools
that they need to help them do their jobs within a jurisdiction.
Absolutely, I appreciate you speaking to the local law and force
around Columbus last year and this year,
and I'm glad it's here on the floor.
We're representing NEO to your left.
Way back here is to your, yes, is recognized.
Representative NEO, recognize for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, Representative NEO.
Is it not true that we strip this bill and put your bill
into the house version, the better version, the preferred version,
to make this a better bill.
Our bill, our bill, our house bill.
Absolutely, and I appreciate your work on it
in public safety and for speaking to federal authorities
to get in better shape.
Absolutely, thank you.
Thank you.
Rep. William is back on our last question to your right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
I had a question.
Do federal law enforcement acting under the request
of state or local law enforcement
have the same immunities as the state law enforcement.
The reason I ask is I'm concerned,
as I'm sure you know, federal law enforcement
are subject to bivons, which are far narrower
than section 1983.
And so if there's a differential in immunities,
it's possible that federal law enforcement
would act in a far less constrained manner
than state law enforcement would in the exact same scenario.
And I'm concerned that in that case,
is either one would point to the other
and either would avoid accountability or,
perhaps even worse, the state would hide
into the guise of the federal enforcement.
That is a good question, Representative Lamb.
And we got some questions answered in committee.
Number one, federal law enforcement.
They are prohibited nationally from moonlighting
and do anything in the private sector
like sometimes people do in Georgia.
So when they come to work with a state law enforcement,
they are doing it under a specific request.
Thank New Orleans on January 1st
when that terrible tragedy happened,
that kind of thing, if it happened here,
we'd want everybody hands on deck
and law enforcement, whether it's a state
or a federal issue going on.
And so the issue of immunity,
if they're doing their federal work on federal matters,
the federal law would apply and the state work,
if they're doing it upon state requests,
that would be governed by analysis
that we have in here in Georgia, I believe.
Mr. Speaker, if there are no other questions,
I yield the well.
have questions, but it's your choice.
I yield well.
You were persuaded.
General Magiore to the well,
is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here in none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
hearing none the report of the committee's agree to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the pass to the bill we'll vote yes all those opposed we'll vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine
Have all members voted all members voted
If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 99, the yeas
are 100 to 52, the nays are 11, this bill haven't received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 298-298?
Senate Bill 298 by Senator Robertson of the 29th to be entitled back to men code section 5-6-34.
The fiscal to Georgia and attended relating to judgments and rulings deemed directly appealable.
Procedures for review, judgments, orders, or decisions not subject to direct appeal.
Ms. Bill Ember for the Committee on Judiciary,
that committee recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chairman Rob Leveritt has recognized
to speak to Senate Bill 298, 298.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're kind of working on a theme here
during this portion of the rules caliber,
because just like the previous bill,
this is sort of a house bill language coming back to us
in the Senate bill.
Senate Bill 298, at least the House or the Rules Committee
Substitute that I believe you have in front of you,
was House Bill 531, in essence.
It provides that a local government or any type of
governmental any that it sued if they receive an adverse
ruling regarding sovereign immunity.
They have a right of direct appeal to that ruling,
but they've got to exercise the appeal only one time
and within 30 days.
During committee legislative immunity and then
legislative privilege has been added to that and it's also there's also a route
for direct appeal on a ruling relating to that whether it's a criminal or
civil case and there is no limitation because of course that can come up
multiple times within litigation during the course of discovery so that's
basically the bill mr. Speaker if there are any questions I'll be glad to try to
That's a good answer.
Gentlemen, has a question representing Miller to your left.
Senator, I'll represent Miller.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Just a gentleman, you.
Yes, ma'am.
Was there any consideration to giving citizens the right to appeal in adverse ruling direct
appeal?
In other words, if the trial court found that the municipality had some kind of immunity
that the citizen could direct appeal it.
My understanding is there afforded a right of direct appeal already because that'd be
a final order in the case.
Thank you.
And this is the, in the statute on direct appeals that are other than final orders.
So if it disposed of, just riddle me a second.
If it disposed of one party to the suit, the municipality, but there were other parties
who did not have the immunity, would the citizen be able to appeal even though the case
was still going on?
And that I cannot answer to.
If there's multiple parties, I'm not sure they probably would have to get a certificate
to appeal in that case.
Thank you.
Thank you for the question.
Gentlemen, there's no further questions.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, I ask your favor consideration of Senate Bill
298.
Thank you and I yield the well.

This bill ever further, committee unregulated industries that committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chairman Powell is recognized to present Senate Bill 241.
Chairman Powell, thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies gentlemen of the House.
tonight I bring you a Senate bill 241. This is a bill by a former member of the
House and to distinguish one of few distinguished senators, who is a member
long-term member of the funeral caucus. Now a lot of people named different
bills and I thought the appropriate name for this might be the buddy of the
Loach Organic Farming Bill.
You know, one of the great things about being on reg industries that we hear
about all of it, but funeral homes have had a lot of ways of disposing by these old-fashioned
ways to bury them, and then you got cremation that a few years ago, I thought I'd about
seen it all when it came up with this alkaline reduction about putting your carcass in a bucket
of acid and all of that.
Well now ladies and gentlemen, there's a new one in this called organic human reduction,
and apparently this is the most the latest and the best on environmentally friendly disposal.
human remains. I think you just basically and I don't know, don't ask me the
details of how you do it. I think you scratch a hole in the dirt and they put
your carcass in it and cover it up so the cats can't drag it out. But what
this bill does, ladies and gentlemen, it puts guardrails on this type of
behavior and it requires licensing and inspections and this protects the
families that choose to use this type of disposal. Now it's almost dinner time so I
caution don't ask many questions because you might get some answers you don't
want to hear before dinner but if there's no questions I'll sit down and yield
the whale. Well there's a question and I'm a little bit concerned but it's my job.
Yes sir. Mr. Smith. Representative Donna Hugh to your left is recognized for
question. The gentleman you? I certainly do. Said not true if this bill passes it
will help your dirt turn into worm farm and every worm farm will be productive.
Well I have no idea that you're right to your honor but I would say that once
your body has been composted and I would almost assure you you can plant it in
a tomato plant and it might add a little bit more acidity to it. Well there's
Because we have one more I want to allow because I want to have dinner and I have to get
over this for a few minutes or the caucus that knows a lot about this issue is represented
by Representative Patty Stenson and she's recognized the lady's recognized.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
It's a gentleman yield.
I certainly do for the lovely lady.
So this question is really to help colleagues in the room that really don't quite understand
our very important industry that really needs to be highlighted more in the state of
Georgia.
Is that not true that the funeral industry does need to be highlighted more in the state
of Georgia?
Absolutely.
And the funeral directing needs to be a part of the list of hard-to-career demands.
Is that not true?
Absolutely.
I agree with you, lady.
And is it not further true that we do need to separate the license of funeral directors
and in bombers on the state of Georgia, is that not true as well?
I would not if the ladies of states agree with her.
But back to this bill, Senate bill 241.
Is it not true that this bill is only for, is optional for families that are, that wants
to have this type of service, this cremation service, and it put guardrails in place to protect
the families as well as the environment?
You're absolutely right.
For those families that choose to use this type of procedure, you know, I think it may
in another year will be bearing them like the crows,
bearing them out west, we'll be putting them on scaffolds
and things like this, but it's just another way
of disposing of the relic remains.
But isn't it not further true that,
depending on the funeral home that you use,
you can probably get a really good deal
by going this route its way, all right?
Is that not true?
Well, I'm not sure about that.
They tell me that this is a pretty expensive way,
but we know high environmentalists are,
they'll pay a little bit more to get a little bit less.
But is it not further true that I have a deal for $3900 that I take care of everything?
Is that not further true?
So, ma'am, so.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I will be supporting this bill and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I would certainly encourage members to vote for Senator Williamsville.
And let's move on to some other subjects.
That's why you're a wise man.
That's all I was waiting on to get it cleared by the funeral home caucus.
The other one is not commenting so we'll just move ahead.
Is the gentleman's yielded the well?
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Hearing none, their previous question is ordered?
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to.
Shout this bill now passed all in favor with the passage of the bill.
We'll vote yes.

We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?

alert. We will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 241, the Yays or 157,

is therefore passed just...
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to members, they would be a little bit longer, a little
bit longer.
Senate bill 213, 213, Mr. Clerk, will you read that caption?
Senate bill 213 by Senator Capatric of the 32nd and others to be entitled back to a men
part two, Article 15, Chapter 1, and Title 10, the fiscal to Georgia and Tate are relating
the Fair Business Practices Act of 1975,
so as to ban commercial cheating services
that target students and examine
a seeking of professional license
this bill having for the committee
and regulated industries,
that committee recommends a dis bill do pass.
Representative Martin,
Representative Chuck Martin's recognized
to present Senate Bill 213.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And all my years down here at the Capitol,
I've never been dying to present a bill
much as I have after following Chairman Powell. Yeah, that didn't work either. No, I do have a simple
but important measure for you this afternoon. There are companies out there that are taking
advantage of our professional people and our students. Advertising that they'll have exams taken
for you. This is in college, our technical schools, but primarily where it's most damage is in
in the professions where these companies advertise
that somebody will take your professional licensing test.
And what we're seeking to do today is add that practice
with the new code section and then have that code section
alluded to in the Fair Business Practices Act.
So the Attorney General would be the person
that can prosecute that.
Our idea here is that these companies
that are praying on students and our professionals
in the state of Georgia that didn't get a license
because somebody else took the test
and are at risk of losing that license
if they're found out.
So what our Senator, Senator Copatric has brought us today
and what I bring to you in Senate Bill 213
is very simple.
It holds those companies responsible for cheating basically
to get a grade or a project done in school
or a professional license or test
and protect the people, the students,
the professional licensees, and the public in the state of Georgia.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll answer any questions.
The hour is late, and we'll move on.
Gentlemen, has no questions?
I yield the well.
As for the favorable consideration of the House
on Senate Bill 213.

discovery and then the prosecutor halfway through that period has to give 30
days of their discovery so that both sides have 30 days where they're worth
the discovery. There's a clarification code on a couple of links and then since we took
away the death penalty we added life without the possibility of parole and then changed
the effective date to the signature of the governor and that was it and I appreciate

Veterans retired military.
I think the speaker is a deep regret this morning before the start of the session.
I got a call from the garrison commander and forced to inform me that they had recovered
the bodies of three of the four missing military people.
The amazing part about it is they were in a six
65-ton technical truck and fell into a peat bog, which they really literally covered
the entire vehicle, could not be found when it was found, special equipment had to be
brought in, General Norrie also released a statement that certainly the hearts of all
members of the third goes out to those that is very doubtful that the fourth person
will be found alive, but certainly all of our communities around Hinesville, Liberty County
and Savannah and all of our veterans along with you, we certainly extend our heartfelt
condolences to the family and we ask that we give them more than one of the silence
these heroes. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Williams. Members, if you're

Hall County, the Gwyneth Police County Sheriff.

trying to find this young man.
He's young, and it's, it's heartening because,
and you think he was, he's nonverbal,
he was autistic, and they found him the day after
on that Friday.
So if we can just give a moment of silence
for the family because, again,
there's young people like that, that means a lot.

of these schools here for morning orders.
So if it's not clear, I love my schools, but I particularly wanted to single out the
parent instructional coordinators and liaisons.
They are the glue of our communities and schools approach in a cluster that represents the
plurality of Title I schools in the Gwinnett County Public School systems.

from these Devon Seaboss recognized for an eppin' order.
Representative Willis, you're next.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of this esteemed body.
I rise today to recognize a true treasure
in the heart of my district,
the crown jewel of Georgia's cultural landscape,
the Earl and Rachel Smith Strand Theater in Marietta
as it celebrates its 90th birthday.
Since opening its doors in 1935,
The Australian has stood as a place where generations of
Georgians have laughed, cried, and gathered for music, film,
and storytelling.
It survived the Great Depression, stood through decades of
change, and thanks to a passionate community effort was
brought back to life with a stunning
renovation in 2009.
Today, it's not just a theater.
It's a symbol, a symbol of what happens when a community
rallies around the arts, a symbol of preservation,
of pride and of purpose.
Whether it's a local high school production,
a classic movie night, or a sold out concert,
the strand brings people to the Marietta Square,
Phil's restaurant, supports small businesses,
and reminds us why the arts matter.
Please join me in honoring the Earl and Rachel Smith
Strand Theatre for his 90 years of cultural excellence,
and in recognizing all those who have worked so hard
to keep the lights on.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
Community treasure.
Hope it lasts for another 90 or so years.
Representative Willis recognized for an afternoon.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Arise today on the last day of Women's History Month.
Sonner, Mayor Emeritus of Atlanta, Shirley Clark Franklin.
Scripture states that with humility comes wisdom.
She is known for being bold, authentic, intellectual, brave,
and compassionate, and that she is.
She was elected in 2001 as the first female mayor of Atlanta,
and the first black woman to lead a major city in the South.
She was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
surrounded by civil activism and at an early age,
her father was a judge.
Her mother and educator, both of whom influenced
trajectory of becoming a staple in American politics. She's the second
generation Howard University graduate, an avid arts lover, and she married
David Franklin. He was an esteemed entertainment attorney and political
strategist. Fun fact, they met while she was a student at Howard. He was in law
school. He said he wanted to represent musicians. She said, please come meet my
classmates Donnie Hathaway and Roberta Flack, who became his first clients.
Last week, Mayor Franklin was honored with the street.
Three blocks from here in a park named in her honor
and she deserves it.
You should know that she despises praise and accolades
of this was no small feat.
She sent me a message thanking me for being there
and speaking on her special day.
I said, for you, are you kidding?
I'd run a marathon barefoot to show up for you.
Thank you for being a safe space in my childhood.
Thank you for being an inspiration to women in leadership.
Thank you for being exactly who you say you are all the time.
And then the spirit of being the music lover she is,
I leave you with this Donnie Hathaway quote.
Soul is about authenticity and feeling,
and I want to give people the real thing.
Thank you, Shirley Franklin,
forgiving Atlanta, Georgia, the real thing.
We acknowledge you today as a dynamic and courageous leader,
and with that Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Congratulations to former Mayor Franklin
on the nice honor having those spaces named in her honor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I rise today to speak on behalf of our three-in-a-fellow member, Representative
Civilian Wakeer, a wakeer of District 64 in Douglas County, right back there.
Representative Baker was recently involved in a car accident just outside the Capitol,
where she was re-ended by a martyr bus.
She is suffering with a lot of pain, however she's doing her best to keep up with her legislative
work.
She's currently under Dr. Sorder to rest and recover.
Rep Baker asked me to thank all of you for your kindness and to let you know that while
she won't be returning for the remainder of the session, right now she is focused on
healing and continuing to serve in every way she can from afar.
Please keep representative Baker and your thoughts and prayers.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
Thank you for reminding us.
Our colleague is certainly not doing well,
so let's keep her in our thoughts and our prayers,
and let her know we miss her.
If you're watching, we do miss you,
and we hope you'll be back soon, but if not,
we'll see you down the road a little bit further.
That completes our afternoon orders, Mr. Clerk.
