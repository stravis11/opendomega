Well good afternoon, hope everyone had a great weekend.
Super Sunday yesterday.
Once again without an Atlanta team.
So we will begin our day though with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which
we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 72nd House District,
Governor's floor leader, Representative Josh Bonner, Representative Bonner.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
It's my pleasure today to introduce you to my friend, Dr. George Dillard.
George has been the senior pastor of Peachtree City Christian Church since 1993.
He is a husband, father and grandfather, and his family roots go back to the 1700s here
in Georgia.
He's the author of three books, has opened the U.S. House of Representatives with a prayer
on seven occasions.
The U.S. Senate wants, and our own Georgia House and Senate on numerous occasions.
And in what I can only assume to be an attempt to become even more like Jesus, George is a
gifted carpenter and has built dozens of beautiful pieces of furniture for family and friends.
He's been wise counsel for me and so many in our community and it's my pleasure today
to welcome the Reverend's Dr. George Dillard.
Thank you, Josh, I wish my mom would have been here to hear that introduction because
she would have believed it.
I want to share something with you this afternoon.
I'm basically a storyteller but I have good company because I think that's one of the methods
that Jesus used quite a bit, but I grew up in the city of Fairburn, Georgia.
It was a lot different back in those days, and my dad owned a hardware store there, that's
where I learned my carpentry skills, and he was also the assistant fire chief for 26
years of the volunteer fire department.
It was a different time and a different day.
I started fighting fires and riding fire trucks when I was 14 years old.
And as most of you can probably understand by the time I was 16, I was pretty sure I had
that thing lit.
And so I got in the habit of riding on the back of the fire truck without holding on, because
I was that good.
In one night, as we were going to a fire, my dad was riding beside me.
I was standing on the back of the fire truck, not holding on.
And we were going down Highway 29 and we hit a bump.
When we hit a bump, I went up in the air.
As I went up in the air, the truck kept going.
And I looked, it was almost like slow motion.
The truck was pulling away and my dad was looking at me with that look like I told you so.
And within just a second it had to be, as the truck was pulling away, as I was contemplating
my time in the hospital, my dad reached out and grabbed me by the collar of my turnout
gear and pulled me back to the back of the truck and saved my life, I'm convinced.
And as I stand before this body today, that event reminds me of something that the Apostle
Paul once said, when I was a child, I used to think like a child and act like a child.
But when I became mature, I put away childish things.
You know, the only difference between the two George Dillards that was riding on the
back of that fire truck that night was wisdom, discernment, understanding, and maturity.
And I am so thankful that he had it, even though I didn't.
We live in a difficult age, and we need men and women who are dedicated to the principle
of putting away childish things and leading this state with wisdom, with discernment,
with knowledge and with maturity.
And it is my prayer that that is the community of representatives, that the great state
of Georgia has sent to this room today. Would you join me in a word of prayer?
O, mighty God, creator of heaven and earth, we praise you because you alone are worthy
of our praise. Father's your word teaches us every good and perfect gift comes from you,
and so we give thanks. And so, Father, I pray today that you would bless the men and women
of this house, that you would bless the leadership, that you would give them wisdom beyond this
world, discernment beyond this age, knowledge that expands beyond our horizons and father
maturity as leaders, strengthen us, prepare us and help us always to remember that every
one of us is your child and your love covers us in Jesus' name. Amen. Would you join me in the pledge?
Our pleasure, allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you so much, good to see you, good to see you.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

in the sexual harassment awareness in the workplace
online training course.
And then it goes on to state that this training is mandatory
and it said that you have 21 days to complete the course.
Now, my notice came on January the 26th.
I would assume most of them went out at that time.
If you have not completed the sexual harassment
awareness in the workplace online training course,
Please do so as soon as you can.
If you have any questions about this,
you can get in touch with me,
or you can call Donald Cronin,
who is our human resources director,
and he will help you.
But please, please be aware of that
and get it done.
It is mandatory.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Rhonda Taylor
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
and good afternoon. I rise today to present our Black History moment, which features William
Bill Powell, the first African-American to design, construct, and own a professional
golf course in the United States. He was a black man in the mid-1960s who was not allowed
to join or play at the local country clubs. So he built his own course and taught the
neighborhood kids got for free.
Power grew up in Ohio and worked as a caddy as a youth.
And he played golf for the Wilbur Force University team
prior to serving in World War II with the US Army Air
Forces.
When he returned home, he encountered the discrimination
and bowed to one day on his own playing field.
He, along with his wife, carved nine holes out of farmland
while working nights at the security guard.
This is the only course built on and operated by an African-American.
Clear view is now a national historic site.
And thank you.
Thank you again, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes Representative McLeod for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and big up to my colleagues.
Saying Black Lives Matter doesn't mean
blue lives, lives doesn't matter,
or anyone else's life doesn't matter.
It simply means Black Lives Matter too.
During the summer months of 2020,
Black people and others who joined them to protest
the brutality captured on camera for the world to see,
they did so to demand that our humanity must not
and cannot be set aside.
not one Black Lives Matter protestors stormed a state capital or the U.S. capital.
They certainly did not commit insurrection. Never in our country's history has the Confederate flag
entered the U.S. capital until Tuesday, January 6, 2021. The treatment of Black Lives Matter
protesters can be measured in numbers. From May 30, June 2, 2020, there was 427 protestors
basically put in jail, and only 52 protestors were put in jail for the storming of our capital.
Unity does not mean dismissal of accountability.
It means that we acknowledge the truth and equity to achieve oneness.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Hobson for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On this 8th day of Black History Month, I rise today to honor someone I admire for decades.
And that would be Dr. Sharon Nayota Tucker.
Dr. Tucker is the first African-American woman
to graduate from the University of Georgia,
Georgia School of Law.
A native of Dublin, Georgia, Dr. Tucker,
during her junior year of high school,
joined six of her fellow classmates from Oclonie High School
and the integration of a previously all-white
Dublin high school.
Nyodo went on to earn a bachelor's of arts degree
and political science from Howard University
before becoming the first African-American woman
to receive a Juris Doctorate degree from the University
of Georgia in 1974.
I won't go through all of her wonderful accolades,
but in addition to the wonderful things
that she's been able to accomplish,
she was also my professor at Mayama
Modern Albany State University.
And she served there for 34 years before her retirement.
Dr. Tucker was recognized on April 13, 2019
at the University of Georgia School of Law, honoring her legacy
by unveiling a beautiful portrait of her, which now stands on permanent display in the
UGA School of Law.
Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and commending the
beautiful Dr. Sharon Nayoda Tucker for her commitment and contributions to our community
and to the State of Georgia.
