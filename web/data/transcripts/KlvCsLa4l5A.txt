There's no comments or questions. I would look for a motion. Motion do pass. We have a second.
And it's LC number one seven two seven four seven two seven two eight yeah
little rusty and flip to the wrong page there we go thank you it's LC
Number 472728S.
All in favor, raise your right hand.
Any opposed?
Bill passes unanimously.
Moving on to SB 208.
That's Senator Dolezal.
Thank you, Chairman.
We have a central QA, which is an enabling legislation
for Senate Resolution 189, which we'll take up next.
which would be a constitutional amendment to allow counties in fast growth,
I'm sorry, boards of education in fast growth school districts to choose to
levy impact fees for capital construction.
Senator Still and I both represent for
South County, which is the fastest growing county of the state.
And we have seen significant burden placed on taxpayers to essentially fund
the new construction of capital projects for schools.
We currently in law allow the collection of impact fees for roads, for park and wreck,
for libraries, for 911 and fire, but we do not allow the levying of impact fees for schools,
which is oftentimes the largest expense borne by a community that is fast growing.
High schools now are pushing AD to $100 million a piece.
So, if you're not familiar with the impact fee laws in the state of Georgia, this comes under those,
But it's quite the process to, if your municipality to get to levy and impact fee, you have to form an impact fee committee.
It has to be made up of largely members of the development community.
They make a recommendation after a study is done.
And then essentially the county, and in this case the Board of Education, can levy up to new developments, pro-rata share of the bird and their placing on the infrastructure.
So, when it comes to the types of things that we have fees or taxes around, this is probably
one of the most fair ways that we collect revenue in the state of Georgia because it's
directly tied to studies and has limits on them such that they are only funding their
pro-radar share.
One thing that I think is worth pointing out in the enabling legislation, this is not
a statewide mandate.
This would only apply to fast-scrolling school systems.
The key to that is on line 41 to 45.
We have two separate triggers of what defines a high growth system and needs to have had
a 20% or more growth during the immediate 10-year period, which right away limits the vast
majority of school systems in the state, and then the second one narrows that and
tailors that even further to those that have had expenditures of $250 million or more
of capital construction during the same proceeding 10-year period.
So with that, Mr. Chairman, I'm happy to answer any questions.
Do you appreciate the committee passing this out last year?
And hopefully we can do the same today.
Any questions, comments for the author?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator, how many districts across the state with this impact?
And second question, did the school boards
ask for this because you're using it based on
population of that particular county, right,
or school district.
Growth of the district, yeah.
Growth.
Correct.
Okay.
So we can't do population bills, as you know.
So this looks at those systems
sort of having hyper growth and hyper capital outlays.
To answer your question, my home district
of Forsyth County, the Board of Education Pass,
you now have this resolution in support of that,
they actually came and testified.
The first time that we heard this last year,
I know that the chairman I've had a conversation,
this is something that Gwyneth some districts
within his area are interested in,
I know Cherokee County, his express interest in this,
I know Henry County, his express interest in this as well.
We really only have a couple pockets in the state
that are growing that much and spending that much money,
so this will be pretty narrowly tailored to just those.
I'm not worried, Savway's joy.
We're shrinking with that, we're hoping to get you the point
where you need this one day.
I'll be dead and gone.
That's how I'm feeling.
I should not say that.
But so only a few, have you had any feedback
from any of these counties that may be included
or have they come to ask for your assistance with?
We were saying like if we were to broaden it
and make it apply to more.
No.
The ones I mentioned before have all either one off
or collectively as a collective board
passed resolutions in favor of it.
But you've not had any negative responses
from those potential.
Correct.
The only negatives that I've heard,
I think we heard testimony of this,
was from some developers and some members
of maybe the apartment association.
I think may have came and testified against this
if my memory serves correct.
But I don't know if you caught this the first time I said,
I think it's worth saying it again.
I was part of the formation of road impact fees
in Versailles County back in 2015.
I was appointed to a commission
by a county commissioner to look into that.
But that committee had to be made up
of at least 50% members of the development community.
So the resolution that we passed
was essentially the people that worked
in the development community,
either developers, road builders, home builders, et cetera,
past a resolution in favor of impact fees for the roads because they basically said look
we got to fund this infrastructure we're going to kill the golden goose.
And so it creates this tension that ultimately tends to usually not land at the maximum
out that would be allowed in a lot of be charged but usually falls somewhere underneath
that but does still provide a revenue stream to fund capital construction to ensure that
infrastructure keeps up.
But this is something we see in a number of states around the country that allow local municipalities to pull that lever if they wish to pull it.
Thank you.
Any further questions or comments?
And I've seen this Senator Sims even in surrounding counties to my home county where they've had to put zoning moratoriums and other things in place.
on schools that come in just because they, you know, completely run out of room to put
trailers in and move students around, so it would become the real issue in Metro Atlanta.
With that, if there's no other comments or questions, would entertain a motion?
I'll make a motion to pass.
Second.
All in favor, raise your right hand.
Passes unanimously.
next LC-49-1280.
Moving on to SR-189, it's also Senator Dolezal.
And this is just a constitutional amendment to put this on the ballot to allow the voters
of Georgia to decide whether we should allow the collection of impact fees for schools.
Any comments or questions from the committee?
Seeing none, would Chair would entertain a motion?
We've got a motion in a second.
All in favor, raise your right hand.
Motion passes unanimously.
Moving right along to SB 147, Senator Steele.
I'm going backing up to the previous one, the LC number on that was LC 491675S.
No backing up to the previous one, it was LC 491327, now you're all set to go to the
senator
We had to make sure we had the right LC number, which we do.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, fellow education committee members.
I come to you today to bring again for your consideration SB 147,
the Boundless Opportunities for Georgia Students Act.
Last year, as you can recall, this bill received passage in this committee and
in Senate rules did not make off the Senate floor table prior to crossover.
Bring this on behalf of my constituents in Fulton, Quinnett, and
Forsyth, which I share with three of the folks here on this committee.
This legislation is simple, it allows toward families to seek the best public education options for their child.
A child zip code should not be the deciding factor in determining their future.
That's why this bill is called boundless opportunities.
County and Sydney boundaries should not determine educational opportunities or outcomes for our students.
This is particularly true in Metro Atlanta, where moving even one block can place a child in a different school system without the parent ever realizing it until they go to register.
for the upcoming year and discovered their student
can no longer attend the same school.
Current law says that a school or school district
cannot receive state funds for a non-resident student
unless the residency district permits it.
This bill simply clarifies these important
often life changing decisions regarding a child's
educational future should be left up solely
to the discretion of the family and the enrolling district.
In other words, the district of residency
should not be able to hold a child hostage
and refuse to allow state funds to transfer with the student.
There are several things this bill does not do.
It does not take any money out of the public system.
It does not take any money from a local school system.
All local property tax revenue, including the amount paid by the student's family will
remain in the residency district.
It does not leave the residency district worse off.
The bill before you ensures that no money will be transferred if it would result in a residency
district being left with less than $10,000 per student.
that's the floor is $10,000.
It also includes a cap on the tuition
that can be charged by the enrolling school district
for providing only virtual instruction.
This is a small but important step to empowering students
and parents who should be the primary decision maker
when it comes to their education.
Right now, a parent's public school options in many areas
of the state are limited unless they
have the resources to move to a higher performing school
district or pay for private school.
In discussing this bill in the off season with my local delegation, which I share with
Senator Dolezal, I've learned that Forsyth County's highly successful virtual program is
now available to enroll out of district students if this bill receives final passage.
This would be a game changer for students in other regions of the state who currently
have little or no educational options other than Georgia virtual.
In closing on a reiterate, this bill is a win-win.
It keeps public money in the public education system.
While also giving parent a greater voice in determining the best school for his or her child regardless of residency or zip code.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I'm willing to take any questions.
Any questions, comments from the committee?
No number three.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Senator, for bringing this bill.
I was in a, we had our pre-legislated breakfast, and I remember hearing how excited our superintendent
was over this bill, and I'm wondering if you could maybe just give us an example.
Hypothetical example, you know, Johnnie's in South Georgia, maybe they don't have a great
STEM program.
Forsyth County's got one of the best in the state.
Johnnie wants to enroll virtually in Forsyth's STEM program.
What happens in terms of flow of funds and what would happen should this bill pass?
Thank you for the question, Senator.
Let's take a full spreadsheet of every county here.
Let's take Clayton County, just going off an example here.
Clayton County receives on their FTE local $3,463.
Their FTE state is $6,942.
Their equalization is $1,064.
So the total cost to educate that child
between state, federal, and local dollars
is 10,406 and 50 cents.
Because of the $10,000 floor on this,
the family would be able to use $406 and 50 cents
towards the total cost of that full-time virtual transfer
leaving $10,000 in the residency district.
And there would be no additional expense
to educate that child.
and then the family would still have
to cover the difference on that,
but at least it's giving them a small amount of money
to use towards that virtual transfer.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Any further questions, Comments?
Yes, sir.
Question.
Go ahead, Senator Sims.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Okay.
So how do we, give me again,
How do we determine the validity of the transfer of the students with the tax dollars,
with the money flowing with them?
How do we make that determination?
Who makes that determination and how do we do it?
The receiving district sets the tuition rate.
The residency district superintendent and the receiving superintendent would have to
agree on that so there still have to be an agreement between them on that and then nothing
would transfer below. So if we were to use an APS as an example where it's over $20,000
to educate a child compared to less than 10,000 in Forsyth County with drastically different
outcomes. The tuition fee would still be set. Superintendents, superintendents. So if
a child wanted to transfer from APS to, again, just using foresight as the example, if
that number was, say, $5,000, then only $5,000 would be transferred out of that equalization.
So if a parent comes to the district and says, I want to be transferred based on the formula
that you gave me. And also based on the scores, what are you going to use to say what's good
and what's bad? Are we using test scores? Because you're saying that they are transferring
from a low-performing school or not necessarily. They're just anywhere they want to go.
where they want to go.
Any further questions, comments?
Senator Settler.
And to the author, is this limited to online learning, or can this be a bricks and mortar
transfer?
This is just a virtual.
Virtual only.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
So in that, which makes it simpler and gig, okay.
Is the, does the language you've added online, 75 through 79, that limiting language, is
that, does that exist anywhere else in code, I mean, is that, is that limiting to a certain
percentage, I'm on 1675S, the charge to extrude shield non-exe 2 thirds, just explain what
that means, I'm just trying to understand.
It's just essentially saying that we're not going to drop
below the $10,000 threshold on the floor.
So there's always going to be an amount left behind
of the residency district.
What we don't want to do is cripple low-perform to the
center sense point.
I don't think we want to do anything to take the local
dollars out.
And so this is just saying that the amount of the tuition
such local unit of administration may charge,
shall not exceed two thirds of the total revenue.
Less the federal, it's just giving us a formula
to work off of on the federal dollar contribution.
Okay, so the receiving district can't chirp some premium.
It's gotta be essentially take the $10,000 out
or whatever that amount is.
And then it limits what they can charge.
So they're not asking for, you know,
for example, if the students,
I'm district or in $14,000 you keep $10,000 behind they have $4,000 to bring with them the receiving district can't charge them 10,000 to get in
Because you're correct. It's it's putting some limits on where they can go without okay
Thank you. That's all right
Any further questions
comments
Chair would entertain a motion
We've got a motion and a second due pass all in favor, raise your hand.
Any opposed?
Passes four to two.
And as all we have on the agenda today, I think this is probably the quickest education
committee hearing I've ever had and probably ever will have with these bills that already
passed through, but with that we are adjourned.
