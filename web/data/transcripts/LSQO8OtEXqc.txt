The hour of convening having arrived, all members will please report to the floor and
take their seats, all members will report to the floor of the house, the clerk will ring
the bell.
All members will please report to the floor of the house. We're about to have the morning roll call.
We're going to have the morning roll call. Now, all members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
keepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well good morning. A lot of energy
in that. I like that on a rainy day. We're going to begin our day with Scripture reading
and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
you're in for a real treat this morning with our chaplain. Let me say a couple of
things that he's not. He's not a minister. He's a lay minister or is he and I
refer to him? He's ministered light. But he is a he's a he's a great human being
and he and I became friends. I met James West last summer in Blue Ridge and you know we don't
get very many professional football players that visit up there and I was having dinner one night
and somebody said that guy over there was a pro football player. I said what's his name? I don't
recognizing. They said his name is James West. I said never heard of him. He had never heard
of me either. So we visited and then we did what people do in the 21st century. We went
off and googled each other and read everything there was to read and then we still became
friends. But he has been, he has become a friend that I feel like I've known for life because
he is one of the most positive people. He's a person of encouragement and strength. And
I can't tell you how much I have appreciated knowing him and being his friend. He was
born in Fort Worth, Texas, but was raised in Houston. He attended Texas Southern University,
very played on the TSU football team, but that wasn't exactly a smooth road. I'll let
him tell you about that. But after he finished his studies at Texas Southern, he went on
to play in the NFL for the Oakland Raiders and for the St. Louis Cardinals, but he also
played for a number of years in the Canadian football league with the Calgary Stampeaters
but most prominently with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.
Who could not like a team called the Blue Bombers?
He is a led them to the Grey Cup, which is like the Lombardi Trophy for the NFL, and was
inducted in 2016 to the Canadian Football League Hall of Fame.
When he finished playing, he coached, it stops around the country, including Oregon State
University and Clark Atlanta here.
And today he has found his real calling in life.
He is a spokesperson, servant, and minister-lite for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
And I can tell you that the work he's doing with young men and women around Metropolitan
Atlanta is truly amazing.
He's joined today by his lovely wife, Gina.
Gina, please stand and let him say hello to you.
They have one daughter and four grandchildren,
and they live in Buford.
Please make welcome, Mr. James West.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Ooh, man, I'm so excited about being here, man.
Y'all gotta slow me down.
Wow, I'm 64 years old,
but I still got this enthusiasm.
I'm excited to be here just to express
what I actually feel today.
I actually realized that during the course of the time
that I actually been invited here,
it's actually been like a struggle ever since
because it looked like the forces of the enemy
wanted me not to come here and not to spread the message
that I know I need to talk about today.
As recently as last night, I had a message
and I had it all ready to go,
but today I come to you knowing that it wasn't me
for to speak that message today,
was something that's pretty much just actually from God.
And so, I realized the day that, you know,
along the way, I've had some people
and some characters just like this gentleman.
And just like that gentleman there,
that's Mark Ratchet.
People like the Speaker of the House, David Rauston.
I love fellowships.
And I love personalizing.
I love being around people.
The good people in your life are those
we actually love or be around.
One of those members also is my wife,
that's Regina, and she's been introduced.
So today, as I changed this subject,
let you know who you are as representatives, as a recommendation. What I
decide was to tell who you are in an area of a acronym. Is that all right with
you? Okay. Now you told me five minutes, so I'm trying to make it through this
fast. So let me know if I'm going too fast. So as an acronym, as a representative
who you are, you are relational, encouraging, purpose driven, relatable, even
minded, sympathetic, eager, neighborly, tangible, amazing, talented, ingenious,
valuable, encouraging, service. That's who you are. That's what a representative is.
I thank God for my place. All the stuff that he talks about early sounds very
impressive, but the most impactful thing was about how much damage it was getting
there. Laws of dad, when I was 13, continuing to lose family members over and over again,
I realized that when you jump in your car in the morning, you have a destination and you
want to take in. What happens alone the way is it's bad drivers and difficult is to get
the place you want to get their own time and then you want to jump in front of somebody
then you start having anger or the disconnect that actually takes us to the place that we
don't realize it. We need to go. It's all about timing. All things
work together for the good of those who love God and according
and call to His purpose. You in this house are called to a
purpose. If you're here, it's your purpose of be here. This is
not by accident that you are here. You're here for a reason. But
it takes timing. And as much as I wanted to be on time, it looks
like I was not going to make it. And I realized that I needed to
have the kingdom to come down to me to remind me that he's here
with me. And as that clock kept winding down for me to get
close, it looked like more and more and more that I was going to
be late, late, late. And as a matter of fact, the last time
they looked at it on my GPS, which is God's position in
system, which takes us to places that we otherwise wouldn't
rather go. Took me to a place that where it seems like
everything was dark at that moment. We want to get in a smooth
place. And we wind up getting that GPS star going down and down
down and down and down and I'll say look at him changes this message must be
you know relevant to what we need to do and it's close to we got here we got
here at nine twenty five nine twenty five my attention was be here at nine o'clock
but we got here at nine twenty five that wasn't the end of the journey we
actually couldn't get it to the driveway in the parking's parking place but
listen this is what God did he prepared a place for us he prepared a place for
But it was one pocket spot in the hall and this is all this pocket spots over there.
One pocket spot left.
It was one.
And as a matter of fact, I jumped around the curb.
I wasn't garlic right then.
I turned that curb, be on my wife's wishes, and I turned the corner, and it was soon as
I turned the corner, it was a pocket spot right there.
Right there.
It was right there.
That's the text.
It was right there.
nothing but God. So in the midst of all the stuff I realize is I need to have a
kingdom perspective on my life believing that anything happens we got to
realize that kingdom needs to come down to us and what happens with that the
thing that changes that for us all is it's being a being mindful of that we
have got to put God first. Seek you first a king of God and all this
righteousness and all these things would be added to you.
Matthew 6 and 33, Seaky first, first in everything that you do.
The reason why you hear is because the conversation about us being connected is
basically because you're somewhere in your life.
If you're not a believer the day in this house,
or somebody in your family has been, somebody has.
The reason why you hear it is somebody else connected you to the Almighty living
God and that's the reason why you hear.
We hear the change lives.
We hear the restore families.
We here to reconcile cultures,
we here to connect community and to impact the world.
That's what we do.
We're here for change.
Like that brother right there is,
I finished this conversation.
That brother right there is Mark Ratcher.
Mark Ratcher went down to Texas Southern University
where he hung out with a brother that didn't look like him.
We called it the Chitlin' Circuit.
And that brother, and I gotta finish this conversation
real quickly because I don't wanna make up your take up
your time? When I came onto that university not, you know, getting, you know,
missing out on every opportunity before I got to take a Southern,
take the Southern as well, started my really my football avenue because every
time I tried out for a team, I got cut. Every sport I tried, I got cut. It was
more than three times. I got cut multiple times. I got cut at least eight
times before I made a team. As a matter of fact, my last opportunity to go to and
have an opportunity to play any sport was going to take a Southern, try to
for the football team. I went out for the team and you know what happened. I could. So I went out
there one more time and I actually got saved as something I never thought I would be doing in this
ministry. And so the thing that saved me, FCA fellowship of Christian athletes, impacting the
words of Jesus through the influence of coaches and athletes, it's something that I'm doing. It's
a calling. You guys are here in the calling, but y'all have an amazing calling. Y'all can impact
the whole entire world with your combinations of people who don't look like you.
Will you come and you embrace them with the love that they actually have that
brother right there? If me and him don't make a connection, it's over thousands
upon thousands. When I'm telling you, this is really serious. Thousands of people
at lives have been impacted because me and that man right there are friends
of this day and I love him. I love that brother. I really do. You can do it too.
As a matter of fact, you have more time being more authority to do it. So as I
close this, I want to thank you guys for realizing that if you realize that you
want to be connected to the kingdom, you got to ask the kingdom to come down here, because
we ain't ready for it. We're ready to go up there. We got to ask the kingdom to come down
and be able to attack this thing in terms of the enemy when it takes us away to a bad location
or it's in like we're in a spot that we're going to be late or somewhere where we got
to get around and make things happen. You got to do that, but we still got to circle
our way back around and map to 63. Seeky first, the kingdom of God and all this righteousness
and all these things would be added to you.
Thank y'all for your time.
I appreciate you.
Let me pray for, is it okay if I pray for us this morning?
I actually try to steal some prayer this morning,
but I want to be sure God said this.
As a matter of fact, I asked him,
I said, Lord, when I come here today,
I want you to be in the talk.
So I hope the visible appearance of me,
the visible appearance of me would be invisible
in terms of your real life.
This is a God's message, it's not mine.
So let me pray for you right quick.
Thank you, Lord, as we welcome you here today,
we value and honor your presence by the way
of the Holy Spirit.
Your ambassadors are here to listen to your place
on the throne, the one of righteousness.
Today, they submit their harsh minds and gifts
into you like that of a child.
Today, we decree and declare that your name would be glorified.
Allow us to the waiting of you in this place.
So today, we decided to step aside and ask
that your wisdom rule and reign in this house,
transform all that has the ear to be changed.
share here and feel the presence of you here also.
After what's left was only memories of the kingdom
upon us here to date in this house
and we thank you for it in Jesus' name.
Now, we all enjoy me in terms of the pledge and leeches.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands.
One nation under God, the indivisible,
the liberty and justice for all, thank you so much.
I can lose it now now.
You

now to morning orders, morning orders.
We have a lot of business to attend to this session.
This house has adopted for many years rules that govern our procedure here on the floor.
40.1 sets a maximum total time for morning orders of 20 minutes total during the
first 20 days of the session and 10 minutes during the remaining part of the
session. So we're going to allocate that as best we can but keep in mind at the
into 20 minutes. It's over and so you can come see the messenger and sign up for
tomorrow. Chair recognizes for a morning order the majority leader of the house
leader Burns. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, good morning. You know for the
The seventh consecutive year, our state Georgia has been named in the number one state in
the country in which to do business.
Largely because of conservative, common sense, business policies initiated and passed by
this house.
Georgia has become the ninth largest state economy in this country, doing no small part
again to the efforts of the Georgia House of Representatives and of the Georgia Chamber
of commerce who both advocate for job creation and free enterprise.
We now currently rank 7th in the nation for the share of women-owned firms and 3rd in
the nation for African-American-owned firms.
We are blessed to have Hartfield, Jackson, Aaron National, airport, most efficient and
busiest airport in the world.
The port of Savannah, the fourth busiest container port in the United States, largely due to
the funding appropriated by this house for deepening of the harbor.
Our population in Georgia has nearly doubled in the past 40 years as we have attracted,
welcomed, and cultivated talent here in Georgia.
The Georgia Chamber of Commerce has worked with this house hand in hand for over 50 years
now. And specifically, over the past decade, the Chamber has worked on over 2,500 bills
in this house, helping to save Georgia taxpayers money and impact in our economy to the tune
of billions of dollars. Additionally, the Georgia Chamber recently
lights a center of rural prosperity that is working consistently with the House Rural Development
Council to ensure that Georgia's growth benefits all all Georgians. Now I think
all of y'all know this but tomorrow morning at 7.30 a.m. that is in the morning
Casey the Georgia Chamber will be hosting this annual eggs and issues
community and business leaders from across this state will be in town for
the event and I encourage you all my colleagues to join me to hear the
remarks of our speaker, the speaker of the House, David
Rolston, as he makes his remarks tomorrow morning and that
event, and continue to support the businesses around this
state and the great work this House and the Georgia, Georgia
Chamber is doing for the citizens of Georgia. How you the
well, Miss Speaker, thank you.
So, gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have, I forgot to
allocate the time so we're going to say three minutes each on the morning
orders till we use our twenty minutes and then we will go on to other
business chair recognizes the chairman of the House Rules Committee for a
morning order chairman Smith joined by the dean of this house dean
Dean Smiley, representative Hugley, and representative Buckner, and representative Vance Smith.
House will be at order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On January 2, 2020, the Armble Tom Book passed away.
On January 2, Georgia lost a statement, the likes of which we never see again, and that
was a quote from someone who knew him well.
Tom Buck, a Democratic representative,
first elected to the Georgia House in 1966,
retired in 2004, 19 consecutive two-year terms.
During his 38 years, he served as chairman
of various committees such as retirement,
appropriation, ways and means, the university system.
And I guess the best compliment of someone
about someone is a quote that someone who knew him well said.
Whenever you're talking with Tom,
it's like sitting in a graduate level government class.
Please join me in a moment of silence for Tom Buck.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Carpenter
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So it is the annual Dalton Day down at the freight depot and I'm going to unleash the carpet
that you guys so much enjoy to see.
This year we're going with the Atlanta Braves.
We'd love to see you tonight at four o'clock at the freight depot.
I have a little fellowship and talk a little flooring industry.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes representative Kendrick for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
So I am giving you your first black fact for this session.
I think every day is a day for black history.
So I was doing some research and some interesting black facts.
And I found the stated belief of the black Panther Party.
And I wanted to share that with you.
So here it goes.
When and the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bans,
which have connected them to another, and to assume among the powers of this Earth,
separate and equal station by which the laws of man and nature's God entitle them,
a decent respect to the opinion of mankind requires that they should disclose the cause which
impale them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they have been endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights
that among these a life-liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the right other people to alter and abolish it.
And to institute a new government,
laying its foundations on such principles
and organizing its powers in such a form
as to them shall seem most likely to affect
their safety and happiness.
You will notice that it's also the preamble
to the Declaration of Independence.
Thank you, that's your black bag for today.
Chair recognizes representative Al Williams for a morning order.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
It took me two minutes to get up here.
I'm going to use the majority leaders three minutes
that he didn't use.
I just wanted this morning to rise and thank those of you
that attended the EC Tillman Prayer Convocation on Sunday
when a grand time, it was a great, great spiritual moment.
I just wish more of you next year will come
because it is a unique experience.
And this year, we honored Chairman Powell and Chair
Senator Kurt.
So it was a very good day.
But especially, and he doesn't know I'm going to say this,
but the majority leader does not know.
We need to thank him because he always steps up
when we ask for his help.
Those itchings are very, very expensive.
And we thank you.
Thank you for what you've done.
And thank the speaker for his participation.
I don't remember the last time he's missed one.
He's always there.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Next year, we look forward to seeing you.
Thank you to never one of you.
Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise to say thank you on behalf of me and my family eight months ago yesterday, a
remarkable wife, a super mother, and an outstanding
naval officer, transitioned from this world.
God bless me with 31 years.
So I would like for you all to join me in a moment of silence.
And again, thank you on behalf of me and my family.
For everyone under this go dome came out
and support it, me and my family.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Silcox
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
I am here to let you know
that the Georgia Department of Transportation
is going to be here today.
They are starting their public information
open houses here at the Capitol.
They are having a drop-in today between 12 p.m.
and 4 p.m. in Capitol Room 417.
And they will be discussing the top-end
perimeter express lanes.
If you are in the Decap, Fulton, or Cobb delegations,
I would highly encourage you to attend.
This will affect everyone in Metro Atlanta,
and I appreciate your attention.
Chair recognizes Representative Drenner
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to take a moment out of our day
to pay tribute to and to wish my mom a very happy,
happy birthday.
As I thought about what I would say, first I would like to take a minute and acknowledge
the losses that each member has experienced this past year.
Mother's wives, brothers, daughters, aunts, uncles, losses of a loved one is by far the
most difficult experience that anyone left living can endure.
Last year my friend, my chairman, and fellow West Virginia, chairman Don Parsons, lost
his mother.
His words resonate with me as I speak today.
He said, enjoy them while you can because when they are gone is too late.
So today I am celebrating my mother, June Laverne Watson's 80-second birthday.
She was born in Boone County, West Virginia.
She was number 8 in a family of 11.
Her dad and three brothers all worked in the coal mines.
She spent 57 years of her life working in government at the municipal and state level.
She retired at 77 and for the last several terms, I have had the pleasure of working with
her during the legislative session.
It's a rare gift as an adult to get to work with your parent.
And I am very grateful for that opportunity.
However last year she fell, and she's not here today.
But you can't keep a good woman down.
She still reads my emails.
She keeps my calendar, and just like in a high school, she still regularly reminds me about
being on time.
In closing, Mom, I want to say thank you for teaching me the values of honesty, of integrity,
the belief in the Almighty, and for continually encouraging me to do my best despite the obstacles.
Whatever God's plan is for our future, Mom, let me say this to you, there is never
a day that I am not thankful for you.
Happy birthday.
If I had a glass of shardonnay right now,
I would hold it up.
So here's to many more.
I love you.
And Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Okay, here's the situation. We're almost out of time, so we have two more morning orders.
I'm going to ask that you be mindful that we're about to turn on the red button, chair
recognizes representative Stovall for a morning order.
Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We say educators and support staff are
important in Georgia because of our children. But it isn't dependent upon if they
are a traditional schools or charter schools. In Georgia, if charter schools
open and they have less than 50 employees, they are penalized and can't get state health
benefit plans on insurance for their employees. They can't participate in the huge discounts
that are offered. They can't utilize the freedom they should be able to do. If they decide
to go get outside insurance temporarily, they won't be eligible to receive the state
health benefit plan ever. There are educators that are uninsured and
Georgia right now who were employed at charter schools.
But in actualality, they could qualify,
but the bureaucracy is prevented.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you're the will.
Chair recognizes representative Bernal for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yesterday Delta Sigma Theta sorority incorporated,
celebrated its 107th Founders Day.
On January 13, 1913, 22 young women studying at Howard University
founded Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated.
At the time, they were seeking to create an organization
that would not only benefit its members, social status,
but would also make a positive impact on the black community.
Since its founding, Delta Sigma Theta has grown into an organization
of over 300,000 members, spanning more than 900 chapters
around the world.
We've walked the halls of justice
using the power in our voice to advocate
for equality, champion health disparities,
impacting our global community.
Work to close educational achievement gaps
and so much more.
For these endeavors among many more,
I wholeheartedly believe that our 22 beloved founders
would be proud.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
That completes morning orders, Chair is going to ask all members of the House to please
take your seats and come to order.
All members, please take your seats.
That means that the conversations that are going on all around the chamber, if you would
and suspend those for just a few minutes.
Just on a time there was a tradition in this house many, many years ago that every session
the mayor of Atlanta would come in and greet members and welcome them.
I don't know where we got off the track with that, but it was way before my time and certainly
way before this mayor's time.
But I'm just very honored and pleased that we have with us today a great leader here,
only in the city, but in the state. I have enjoyed coming to know Mayor Bottoms. We have
had many, many discussions. I can tell you that we have a great relationship in terms
of respecting each other's point of view. We don't always agree.
But we respectfully disagree sometimes.
But I will tell you this, that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is a hard-working, tireless advocate
for this city and for the state of Georgia.
She is a great mayor for Atlanta and is a great partner working with the state.
And I'm honored that she would come today to bring greetings to the House.
to make welcome the Mayor of Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
Thank you very much for your very warm and gracious greeting.
Speaker Ralston, a speaker, pro-tam, Jan Jones, majority leader, John Burns, minority
leader Bob Tremel and the Dean of the Georgia House, my dear friend Calvin Smirey, I appreciate
all of you all here and I am grateful that you have allowed me to bring greetings on
behalf of the city of Atlanta. I know that yesterday you took a moment to acknowledge
Representative Jay Powell, who was such a valued member of this body and I joined you
and being grateful for his servant leadership to our great state.
I had the great honor and privilege of greeting your colleagues in the Senate on yesterday.
And I share with them that sometimes, Mr. Speaker, I struggle between bedside baptists and
actually getting out of the house, getting to church, not because my heart is not there,
but it's just sometimes a challenge.
But on Sunday I fought through it and God led me to a church near my home that I haven't
attended in some time and when I got there I was late and I continued to push through.
But as I walked in the minister was beginning the sermon and it was from the book of Ruth
which was my grandfather's favorite book in the Bible.
So I knew that I was in the right place.
And then the minister talked about divine companions.
And I took a lot of notes because I needed to hear that sermon on Sunday.
And if you all are familiar with the book of Ruth, what I shared yesterday is my grandfather's
favorite scripture in part says, where you go, I will go.
And your people will be my people.
And the minister spoke about how impactful companionship is and that we aren't created
to do things in isolation, and not to neglect the people that God has given to you and your
life to make you better, and divine companions often lead you to solutions.
And another point that he made is sometimes you only need one divine companion that we
often lament not having many, but sometimes it's about having the one on our side.
Well, as I am here today, what I see in each of you all is divine companionship.
For me, my roots in Georgia come from the peaks in Crawfordville, Georgia, the shields
and Madison and Winder and the Robinson's and Athens.
And when I look at each of you all, I know that you have come from near and far, but we
are here together.
And I can tell you in these divine companionships that I've found in my two years as Mayor Falfrenz
like Speaker Ralston, who to my surprise, when I met him, the first thing he said to
me was, I loved your daddy's music.
I could not have been more pleasantly surprised, because you see sometimes our divine companions
don't come in the neat packages that we have put in our heads as to what they should
look like and where they should come from and how they should appear.
But what I can say to you is that as mayor of this city, I know that my people are your
people.
And I know that although we may not always agree as Speaker Rossin has said, we want the
best for the people of this great state of Georgia.
And together we've been able to accomplish so very much.
together, I know that we will continue to do that. And I'll just leave you with a story
I shared on yesterday that in my first years, I went around meeting different people in
the House and Senate, I had a very productive meeting with someone that wasn't you, Speaker
Austin. And when we finished the meeting, he said, now you better not go out and tweet
about it. Because he didn't want anybody to know that we had a great meeting. So what
But I'll say to you, if you don't tell, I won't tell.
I know how to keep a secret.
Your secrets are safe with me.
So let's have some public great meetings.
And we can have some secret great meetings.
But at the end of the day, I know
that it's for the good for the people of Georgia.
May God continue to bless you.
And I wish you a successful session.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
