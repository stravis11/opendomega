TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everyone and welcome to Wages and Waivers Day. It's always great to see you
here at the Capitol. It's so important that you make the effort to get here and I know
it's hard to get here. Here's why it's important to be here today. It's been nearly 25 years
since the Supreme Court homestead decision,
which said that people with disabilities
have a right to state funded services
to live and thrive in their communities,
rather than being forced to live in institutions.
And it's been nearly 16 years since our state entered
into a settlement agreement with a Department of Justice
and committed to giving Georgians with intellectual and developmental disabilities the support they need to live in their own homes and lead productive lives.
Since then, it's been a long, slow road and truly to truly give this community what it needs to thrive.
I first became involved in this issue when I served in the house,
fighting to end the waiting list for Medicaid waivers,
and when I came back to the Senate 14 years later,
the Medicaid home and community-based services waiting list
was still there and was longer.
I always tell my constituents that when they want something
done in this building, you've got to be loud.
We've made some progress in Georgia with IDD issues in recent years because this community
has shown up and been loud and because you've been loud, we increased funding for waivers
from approximately 100 per year to 500.
We passed Senate Bill 610 to make sure Georgia did reimbursement rate studies every four
years so that wages for our service providers kept pace with the markets.
Senator John Albers and I co-sponsored a Senate study committee on Georgians with intellectual
and developmental disabilities and we heard from hundreds of advocates, parents, caregivers,
experts and service providers all over Georgia about what we need for our
states. Thanks to the study committee, we now have a road map to finally deliver
on the promise that Georgia made 16 years ago to build on a comprehensive
network of community supports. We know what to do.
So we all have to get the work done.
It's a simple, three-step process.
One, we need to pass Senate Bill 198,
a Georgians with intellectual and developmental disabilities,
Innovation Commission.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
This is modeled on the successful Behavioral Health Commission,
made up of experts and advocates that will roll out their sleeves and work on updated
solutions to the long-term challenges of Georgians with IDD and the challenges they face.
They'll tackle issues like supportive employment, housing, manage care, and more.
The commission will help more people with IDD gain independence and help them contribute
to their communities.
Senate Bill 198 passed the Senate Health and Human Services Committee last week.
Now we need to get it to the Senate floor and through the House.
Number two, we must fully fund the Service Provider Rate Study
in the FY2425 budget.
We have been losing ground with our talented case givers.
We're losing them to other paying jobs, better paying jobs
in the marketplace.
So even if we wanted to end the Medicaid waiting list today,
we wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand.
D.B.H. D.D., Commissioner Tenor-Capt, Kevin Tanner estimates that this rate study could
increase our provider rates by as much as 40%.
These service providers give so much of themselves.
We need to take care of our caregivers.
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Finally, number three.
We need to end the waiting list for now in comp waivers once and for all.
That is now within sites.
Thanks to the work of Commissioner Tanner, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental
Disabilities and the support of my colleagues, this is now a very real reality.
This is a work that we still have left to do, and this is why we need to keep showing
up and why we have to be loud.
Do we have any legislators here this morning?
I don't see any.
Okay.
I now want to introduce members of this community who are going to speak about why getting
this work done is so important. So first, we have Dorothy Harris.
Hello. My name is Dorothy Harris. I'm the official torch. I'm a state and
It's aerial, self-advocate with the United for Change.
We are a grassroots network of self-advocates or calls the state.
We support people with international development and disability.
I am passionate about self-advocacy and have been a part of people first of Fitzgerald
chapter for over 20 years and a member of the Georgia Council of Development
to Disability. Today, I would like to talk about how important it's in the bill
198 for South advocate. It's important because there has to be a group of
other students who learn and listen and better understand what we need so that we
could grow as a contribute citizen in our community. A commission will give us a
place and a government official to discuss our hopes and dreams and issues like
transportation, marriage penalty, wear employment affordable housing so we
don't have to live with four people if we don't want to. We need to be at the table because
we are registered voters and we vote in our voices count. It's also important that the
governor provides the funding that is needed for our direct support professional or DSPs.
DSP is the person that's been the most time with us
doing our daily activities and support our teams.
We need the DSP to make a little bit of wage
just like anyone that worked at McDonald's in Burger King.
We have relationship with our DSP and we trust them and listen and know that our label
or IDDD is do not make us in the finals.
They listen, we all have gifts just like you.
The self-advocation for the United from Change
are guaranteed to know their status better.
So we can be seen that's our responsibility as advocates.
We will continue and advocate and rise up and speak out.
Thank you all.
Thank you, Dorothy. Well said.
Next, we have Diane Willis, founder of the Service Provider's Association for Developmental Disabilities
who has been a tremendous partner in this work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We all have a little bit of time, right?
Good morning, everybody, and thank you for the opportunity to share with you,
kind of reinforce what our Senators Harold mentioned to you,
which is we really must pass Senate Bill 198.
We operate in an antiquated system and a highly complex,
somewhat inefficient system.
It is very challenging for families and individuals to navigate,
and we surely can do better.
So, to that end, we need passage of SB 198 in order to assure we move IDD services into
the 21st century.
The next thing I want to point out is we must, we must pass the rate models and the funding.
We are super grateful to the governor for taking the bold step and putting it in his budget,
which since I'm an old dog and been here forever, I can tell you has never, ever happened before.
So this is a milestone step and a critical one in order for us to provide supports and
higher caregivers, direct support professionals, to do the important work and
support individuals. This is the rates where the first time there's been a
comprehensive study of the funding of this system since, believe it or not,
1990. We can do better. So we must pass the budget. And finally I want to talk
about the waiting list. Again, as Senator Harrell mentioned, this has gone on
entirely too long. Individuals are waiting for supports and services that are
so vital to avert crisis to support people in a way that they should be supported in their
local communities with their families. It occurred to me last night when I was preparing
to be here that telling a family to wait for IDD support services to wait for a waiver
is like telling a hungry family to wait for food stamps.
This is sustenance.
These services keep families together and avert crisis,
and we have to stop making people wait.
There's no reason to do this.
So, all that said, I appreciate the opportunity
to share a provider's point of view, and thank you,
and let's get this done.
Thank you Diane, everybody on those steps. I know it's hard to stand there. Keep it up.
I've been on those steps a number of times.
Thank you. Next up we have a Kaiser, a parent advocate from Johns Creek.
Good morning. My name is Tais Kaiser. I am a mom from John's Creek and I have raised
three beautiful sons. My oldest son Isaiah is 22 and has autism. Intellectual disability
and he struggles with a mental illness.
I am here on behalf of him and for unlock Georgia,
a broad-based coalition whose mission is to expand
and enhance home and community-based services
to fully support Georgians with intellectual disabilities.
My son, Isaiah, has many daily struggles.
He's challenged what daily living skills.
He needs support to dress himself appropriately.
He doesn't grasp the concept of time, money.
His reading level is at a kindergarten level.
Isaiah needs help with the simplest things, like pouring milk.
He needs long-term support for the rest of his life.
I am one of the parents that is here advocating
to get my child on the now-encompassed.
I applied four times and I was denied four times.
The last resort was to sue the Department of Behavioral Health.
After spending $60,000 in expenses, I won.
Woo!
Woo!
After years of fighting, Isaiah was finally deemed eligible for the now-income waiver services.
It was emotionally, financially draining for me and my family, and that was just to
get my son a spot on the list.
Technically, we do not have the waiver.
For families in my situation, this is a fight that they can't afford.
Families with autistic children are reaching out for help.
They need and deserve only to be met with a system that is working against them.
I will never, ever stop fighting for this community.
Today I'm here to support the three key advocacy initiatives for the season.
which is the 2400 spots for the now in comp waivers we want a reduction at
least a reduction on this list eliminating the current list has 7,000 people
waiting my son being one of those individuals higher wages for direct
supporting professionals advocate supporting the addition which it comes to be
about 79 million from the Department of Behavior Health's budget for the 2025 fiscal year
to implement, that was implemented on the IDD rate study services.
Third, the passage of the Senate bill 198 that was established an IDD commission establishing
would create a forum for comprehensive discussions aimed at better supporting individuals with
ITD, critical issues, including Medicaid, waivers,
employment, opportunities, housing, accessible health care,
it's in need of attention.
By fostering a dialogue in collaborating,
the commission wouldn't hence an understanding
of the unique supports and need required
for individuals to thrive in their communities.
I want to improve the current system,
and I'm here to help.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.
We have a legislator who has come and I'd like him to say a few words representative
Long Tran.
Thank you Senator Herald.
Good morning.
My name is Long Tran.
State Representative of House District 80 and it's an honor to be here this morning.
As we continue to talk about how great the state of Georgia is being the number one state
to do business and trying to become the number one state to live, we have to become the
best state, the leading state in which we have no waiting list for our family struggling
with IDD.
There's no reason why we can't achieve that while being the number one state to do business
and we have to pass Senate Bill 198.
And so thank you for being here this morning,
continue to advocate for your families.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative Tran.
And to those of you on the steps,
we'll take a few questions and you can move, OK?
We would like to take any questions.
And if my experts can come up and join me
so that the person who has the expertise
the issue can respond. Questions? Okay, I guess we made, oh, okay.
Okay, the question is that the Commissioner of DBHDD has come up with a plan for serving
900 people getting them off the waiting list each year.
The commissioner has, I'll let other people address this too, but the commissioner has been
very friendly to all of the recommendations that were made for the study committee and
has, in fact, been working on a number of those items even without a commission.
And one of the things he has worked so hard on is improving processes within the department.
So I think that is very, 900 is very doable.
I personally think we could do more than that.
Oh, thank you so much.
Hey, thank you for the question.
I'm Darcy Robb with the Georgia Council
on Developmental Disabilities.
I agree.
We really appreciate our partnership
with Commissioner Tanner and his team.
And I am confident we are moving the system
in the right direction.
We're gonna continue to move it.
But frankly, GCDD stands 900 a year.
we need to do more, the wait list has hovered between 6,000 and 8,000 for over a decade.
GCDD put together a chart that shows both the new waivers and the attrition and we've
been treading water on the waiting list for at least 12 years now.
The other piece of the waiting list that I need to point out, two pieces, number one, Georgia
has a very high bar for qualifying for a now or comp waiver.
In many other states, including our neighboring state Tennessee, more folks are eligible for
waiver support than they are here in Georgia.
So Georgia has a high bar.
The other thing I think it's important to note, not everyone eligible for a waiver is
on the waiting list.
And one of the ways we know that is that when people are abandoned in emergency rooms,
which is happening to individuals with developmental disabilities, it is a crisis and that's something
Commissioner Tanner and his team have been working on, but when those folks are
abandoned in emergency rooms they fall into three groups. One group is people who
have a waiver and have had a crisis. One group is people on the waiting list, the
third group is people not even known to the state of Georgia. So we want to
end the waiting list full stop.
In Senate Bill 198, the commission is, it's planned for the commission to meet for five years.
I think it would be reasonable to make a goal of ending the waiting list in that five years.
Yes.
Okay, the question is, what are the wages for our Dex service providers?
What are they making now?
What do they need to make?
And how much do we need to bulk up the workforce, and I'm going to have Diane Willis answer that
question.
Thanks for the question, because it's super important.
The most recent data that we have is that Georgia exceeds the national average in the turnover
rate of direct support professionals, as we call them DSPs.
Our turnover rate statewide average is about 43%.
We don't have the most current data that is 22 data, that we should have the new information
very shortly, actually.
I think that the information is that the average range is around $13.
The waivers without this rate model fund wages at $10.63.
So that's the reimbursement, that's what's built into the funding.
The new weights will bring that wage to $16.70 and again we are so
very grateful for that positive change. However, I will tell you, that's like a
down payment. Wages need to be at $18 to $20 an hour in order for us in order
for us to recruit and retain high caliber staff in these positions.
organizations continually churn people for that first year or so because it's
such a challenging and difficult job but so very important and valued. We can do
better. So rate models passing that will be one part and then we're due thanks
to Senator Harrell to have another rate study in two years and we need to
address wages again we can't I don't want to hear that well we already gave you
money this is the first money really since 1990 so there you have it other
other questions?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, yeah, because I'd like to look at this.
So the observation was that the wait time
on the waiting list is like four years
and what are we gonna do to reduce that wait time?
That's why we're having this advocacy today
because it's going to take both funding more waivers
each year and increasing wages
so that we can get rid of both waiting lists,
one for waivers and the ones for services. So that's why we're here today and
that's why we're developing this commission to keep track of this issue to
make sure we're moving forward on those goals. That will reduce the weight.
Any other questions? Yes?
Okay, so the observation is that we have a lot of doctors here today.
And so the question is, what can you all do to help us serve people with developmental
disabilities in their communities would anyone like to speak thank you thank
you for your support yes
would you like to speak don't know about the way this but we are committed to
mental health we are working with Kevin Tanner you'll hear a little bit more
about this, but we are very committed to reaching out to our patients in Georgia, addressing
these mental health issues, starting with our young all the way up, you'll see more
and more of us activity out there.
So thank you.
Okay, so the question is how do we address the workforce needs for the direct service
providers in the rural areas of the state. Again, it's a wage issue. It's simply a wage
issue. If we had adequate wages, the recruitment of people, even in rural areas, would be far
much increased. I don't think even when you have a thinner population, that if you have
a wage that's commensurate with the work and the value of the work. I don't think that
recruitment is as much of a challenge. Make sense?
Also one of the recommendations from the study committee was to take steps to professionalize
direct service workers careers through maybe some sort of certification process.
I should have mentioned as well to give some credit to the Department of Behavioral
Health because they are piloting a credentialing pathways so that direct support professionals
can receive a credential at a one, two, three level, which would then add income.
So you'd start at a base rate, and then if you got credentialed, you'd go up in a credential
two, three, and so forth.
They are using ARPA funds to fund three projects throughout the state.
One of them is through UGA.
One is with the Department of Labor, and one is with United Cerebral Policy.
So that also demonstrates their commitment to this wage issue.
They want to build a credentialing process into the rates.
So that is huge progress and very meaningful.
Okay, I had a question from behind me about the commission and the question was, who is
going to be appointed by the commission, what type of people, and by whom.
Senate Bill 198 spells out exactly the kind of experts and consumers who need to be brought
into the commission.
The appointments will be made by the Lieutenant Governor, the Governor, and the Speaker of
the House.
And specifically, it was asked, how do we ensure that people of color are appointed to
that commission and I would say we're going to have to be allowed again and as we as a community
think about who needs to be on that commission we're going to need to think about diversity of
experience being represented and make recommendations to those three elected officials to make sure they
are in the appointments are inclusive. So again it's part of being loud. Any other questions?
The question is, do I have a sense for when the bill will get a vote in the chamber?
I will say it passed unanimously out of health and human services.
This is a very good sign.
I will be going to rules today to ask the rules committee to move on the bill and bring
it to the house floor so I'm hopeful that might happen before crossover day.
else. I see another legislator here. Representative Viola Davis would you like to say hello? Okay let's just
recognize that she is here supporting us. And I see another representative would you like to come
up and say a word? Hello everyone I'm Representative Teddy Reese from Columbus Georgia and I have some of my
constituents here today? This is a worthy cause I just implore you to continue
to fight, continue to stay in the fight, stay strong, and this is where it gets
done. You have to show up. If you're not here being an advocate for yourself and
I'm sure Rep Davis would agree with this, then your issues will not be heard. So
this is a very important step we're glad to have you here today. Talk to as
many leaders as you possibly can and make sure they understand what's
what's important and what you're passionate about.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Representative Reese.
I know these people on the steps are getting tired of standing.
Any other questions?
Okay, thank you all for coming.
And a special thanks to the Georgia Council on developmental disabilities
for their partnership and for organizing the wages and waivers advocacy day.
Thank you everyone and go be loud.
