----------
I don't know where to get a replacement one of those. So we will call this meeting to order. Thank you all for being here. We've got a fairly robust agenda this morning. So for our speakers, we're going to just ask that you keep an eye on the clock and on the slides and committee members certainly want to leave time for all of our questions. So I'm going to call on you've got number three, right, representative Townsend to an open and simple error, please. Thank you, heads. Dear Father, thank you for this day. Please bless this committee and help us make wise decisions for the students of Georgia. And thank you for everyone being here and please allow them safe travels away back home. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Thanks, sir. So if we will, members, as we have always done, just especially for those in the audience who may be new and those who are at home watching online, if we could just go around with brief introductions before our speakers start. And I'll try to get all of our numbers accurate. So representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. I'm Stacey Evans. I represent House District 57, which is parts of the city of Atlanta. Representative Bethany Ballard from Warner Robbins, House District 147, which is Warner Robbins in Centerville. Thank you. Morning. I represent the Rick Townsend from District 179 St. Simon's Island, Brunswick, area and I'm glad to be here. Good morning, Tiffany Taylor, with the Georgia Department of Education.

And I'm Matt Dubnik from Hall County and I represent City's Gainesville and Oakwood and share the K-12 appropriations committee in the house. So we'll allow for some other introductions as our members come in. But thank you all for being here. We have, and I'm going to kind of leave it to our folks from DeCab County to split up the time and the order, but we'll jump right into the program. And so we have three representatives from DeCab County from the school district as a whole, the early college academy and the career tech and ag ed. So to Miss Gunter, Mr. Conner and Dr. Sals, thank you for being here. Again, the microphone is now hot and you are free to begin your presentation and we'll dive in with questions upon completion. All right, thank you very much. All right, first of all, before we get to introductions, just a quick word of thanks to house members and senators and there's a lot of other people that didn't introduce themselves. I'm sure they are doing fine work on behalf of K-12. My name is Edward Conner. I am the super proud principal for DeCab Early College Academy. Good morning, everyone. My name is Dorian Gunter and I am the director of Career Technical and Agricultural Education for DeCab County Schools. Good morning, everybody. My name is Norman Saas. I serve the DeCab County School System as area superintendent for high schools. Thank you for having us here today. All right, as far as DeCab Early College Academy, it opened in 2006 and I have been fortunate enough to be its principal since 2013. We are one of seven early colleges in the state of Georgia where they are the second oldest carver in APS opened up in 2005. So as I like to say on Twitter, they are the oldest but we are the better of the two. As you will see, we are far and away the most successful version by any qualitative or quantitative metrics. And that is a whole team effort including ed policy all the way down to the classroom. So as far as early college model, again, Ms. Gunter will speak to any questions regarding CTAE, but as far as early college model schools and some of them are 612, there is about 250 in the nation. Some of them are 612, most of them are 912, some of them are housed on university campuses so they just walk across the quad if they are strong in literacy. And then they come back to the high school setting. Hours is located in the Central Office of Stone Mountain and our college partner is Georgia State right off of Memorial Drive. The main mission, the moral mission that is baked into early college is maximizing exposure to higher ed to underrepresented populations. So in our building and most early colleges, it would be tons of first generation college goers. Lots of low income families because we are a Title I school. Our demographic as far as population, it is 3-4 female to male and we have an abundant representation of people of color with about 70 different languages being the primary one at home. With early college and the funding part in all 3 funding models that the state is engaged in, the goal here was to compress money and time. They are getting dual credit so when they are in college chemistry, they are earning that Carnegie unit to get a high school diploma. And with some of it being funded or all of it having been funded in the past, that is a scholar who maybe thought in middle school they weren't going to go to college, walking out with an associates and 60 hours that are transferable within the university system of Georgia. The other awkward thing about that is they get their associate diploma two weeks before I hand them their high school diploma. So they think it doesn't count but the grandmother and the third row screams every time. It counts. So how you get a ninth grade are ready for college in half the time is focus on content but mainly focus on what is it like to navigate a college environment, a university setting. They all are smart and they all are driven but it's a trick to have to advocate for yourself. So we call our teachers professors so they start to get into the habit of going to office hours and what have you. A quick snapshot of de Caberle College you've already heard some of this before. We have about 300 scholars. The ninth and tenth grade is it's one wing of the AIC so that's we can take in about 80 90 students per grade level. Two thirds are free and reduced lunch. It's not this magnet gifted program. I mean our average numbers of gifted scholars are about the same. We're actually just looking for first generation has the grit and determination to do something that nobody else in their family has done. Our multi-language learner percentage is low because by high school they're either on monitored status are gone but as more people come in particularly in the Clarkston area with the refugee population. That's a pipeline from freedom middle school to us and that gives you a breakdown as well as far as black, Hispanic and so on. So this is sort of the brag slide. I really would say it I mean I know my my area superintendent is like five feet from me but it's actually something that I would want you all to see because of the work that you have done with the Gates Foundation at the very onset of early college model schools that had to be some conversations with the state. So I just wanted to thank you because you have a hand in this. We were recently named a national blue ribbon school of excellence by the state by the US DOE for high performing schools. That's book ended at the bottom that we were a Georgia school of excellence in 2012 and all the stuff in the middle is the stuff that parents like. But the kids my scholars would kind of glaze over they like the real experience of we have been a top four high school in this state since 2012 and obviously with CCRPI being on hold during the covert years. I don't think that would have stopped but it obviously we're going to pick that back up again. So far as federal funding we're a title one distinguished school and have been since the early 2010-2011. We are always recognized by US News and World Report. My boss just whispered that we are in the top two percent of all high schools in the US so I'll have to acknowledge that. The US News and Report breaks it down by district by state and by the US and we are one of the top 600 schools in the US so you think how many high schools are in the US and that gets us to 2%. A lot of people think we're just high performing but the stuff that I take the most pride in with GOSA we are always recognized for both greatest gains and highest performing because again it is not a gifted magnet program. There's an application process we're actually kind of looking for some they always in the interviews say hey I got in trouble and when you talk to them about it something happened in seventh grade beyond a preteen or teens control. So I look at you and say I want to go to college that's usually the point that I stop and say welcome. That's a lot of quantitative stuff if we had more than 15 minutes there are a thousand stories about the scholar journey that are far more interesting. If you get your associates and your high school diploma at the same time a scholar could graduate from UGA by 19 graduate from law school by 21 or 22 and be a district attorney in Decap County and that's actually a true story. If you have your associates by the time you're walking across the high school stage and all of those credits transfer in the university system of Georgia or the tech side of Georgia they are halfway home to a bachelor's degree depending on the funding model with minimal or no cost. That's the real story there the numbers are intriguing but what scholars do is why I get up every morning and why I'm thankful that you let us come today. So what you're looking at here is a graduation rate comparison the one in the middle that is blue that's the state high school graduation rate from roughly 2012 and the ones haven't been released yet for 2023. That's amazing heavy lift from you all and state superintendents and every other superintendent that blue line is continuing to trend in the upper direction so again that is not something to take lightly. The orange one at the top is our high school graduation rate. It has never dipped below 95 percent. Weirdly when you get a scholar prepared for college in half the time high school becomes a breeze. I never talk about in of course testing I never talk about CC RPI I always talk about in a semester you're going to be sitting in college chemistry or intro to ethics are you ready to read and dissect the cipher text like that. If you trained for college the other stuff just comes along for the ride. Now the other line you see there is probably the reason why I'm here today what you're looking at there is weirdly a history of the three funding models for dual enrollment. I'm here to talk about how great the three in the middle are that spike up because that's when it was fully funded anything I can say today to get you to think about walking beyond 30 hours for a traditional college setting. I would be eternally grateful my parents would be eternally grateful. So what you see with that gray one is in the early days title one families paid roughly $1,400 every semester fall in spring of their junior year fall in spring of their senior year maybe some overload semester or they paid a little extra in the summer to get to the 60 hours to get an associate's degree when it spikes up to 61. So that was the second funding model where things were fully funded. Would you like for me to pause so they can introduce themselves? No? Okay. That's a teacher I just called you out for being late that's totally my fault. So the three in the middle the 61% the 96 and the 83% that was the second funding model everything was fully funded. And yes our associates graduation rate was higher than or equal to the state's high school graduation rate. But the big dip down to 9% you can't attribute that to the change in funding with House bill 444 a little bit but that's obviously COVID. And then in this new funding model where 30 hours are are free to families you can see that it's trending back up but it will roughly stop at the same as the first funding model. So anything I can say to you today to walk is somewhere close to more funding means that that will spike up at my school and every other high school that has a real sense of dual enrollment the other early colleges and the number represent a kid that's well on their way to being a productive citizen of Georgia. So there are a lot of ways to actually implement that. How could you sustain and build on dual enrollment one you can increase the funding for just early colleges. That seems to that's too limited if I walked in here and I had an opportunity to speak to you and say hey just my schools but it's an idea. I want to have more enrollment opportunities for the tech college system of Georgia include more pathways which you've already done with Senate bill 86. So I'm here to talk about traditional colleges you could set up a parallel structure to the hope career grant for a more traditional university. I know Miss Gunter would have a ton of parent stories about thank you very much because that's 30 hours and then the tech system it doesn't matter. If you don't want to build that kind of structure that's parallel to the hope career grant you could tap into traditional hope funding. Hope pays for 127 semester hours. If a scholar took advantage of the 30 that's already in place they have 30 to go to get an associates with all the parent scholar acknowledgement that I'm dipping into this early if they use 30 hours of that in high school to get an associates. They still have 97 credit hours through traditional hope in a higher ed setting. They only need 60 more to go to finish. So they have two years to go but a little over three years of hope funding if they stay in Georgia and all the credits transfer. Any tech alumni in the room yes you have to retake math that has to have that seal of approval. But rebuilding something that looks like hope career grant or don't bother building that and tap into what's already in place would get those numbers and that line graph back to where it should be. So I stand here to tell you that college writing this is doable in two years in an early college but I've had some leaves my school and go to another to cab county school and their parents advocated with a counselor we had to leave for a reason beyond our control but this is what I want to do. You can do college in high school at the same time both very successfully. And it's equitable. I mean the moral mission is already baked in somebody that would not have it exposure to that in the right structure of school parents and willing kid and ed policy pushes children to places that I could never ever dream of. The conversations in ninth grade counseling to what they whisper to me when I hand them a diploma I couldn't imagine what they were saying to me. So again I know you have a row bus agenda you might have some questions for us. I just want to again say thank you for giving us the opportunity this is the pathway between CTAE and traditional dual enrollment. If you want to wave of smart engaged voters taxpayers Georgia citizens this is the leg up for that thank you. Do we have any questions from the committee. Representative Townsend. Thank you more and thank you for the presentation my wife actually taught her early college academy I guess back in Brunswick before they closed. What you guys are doing are a good job and appreciate what you're doing and please keep it up. I guess a couple questions first on the dual enrollment hours and suggestions. I think a lot of people in this room what happened back in the day. Too many school systems abused the dual enrollment hours where they were taking every course they can think of bringing the instructors into the schools and really took courses they didn't need. I think that's what hurt overall hurt the budget and we didn't want hope to go away is before my time here in the house but I was a practitioner education myself. That's why the reasons for the change one of those I think down the road hopefully we can have discussion with would be something similar what you said I'm not sure if you're going that direction or not. But that first 30 hours we know does accounting is their hope credit when they get hope scholarship doing enrollment when they get to college. But is there a way to start that time clicking while they're still in high school knowing they eat at the hours but at least they're still they're just doing it a little bit earlier than normal. I don't know if that's a question we have down the road. So I kind of understand what you're saying second would be if this is so successful the Calb's a huge system. I actually graduated from the Calb myself I went through a watch worth elementary and my Thonia high school. My question is if this model is working for cab county you have to worry about your community. The Calb's big enough to have a couple of these it's not three or four but at least two have y'all thought about expanding. All right as a humble principle I will save the second question for somebody higher up the food chain but as for your second idea if it really is a matter of some of your constituents being worried about wasteful text dollars. When you tap into hope and you have to have parents sign that I'm already accessing something that's supposed to be post secondary. You would make the catalog restrictive core content and world languages. If it's just that they wouldn't be able to say you're taking a course that is irrelevant. Everything I just mentioned is going to fall into a program of study for some associates degree. So when you work after the 30 and tapping into hope the language would just have to be clear. Only these courses this part of the catalog is allowable and then it would be up to us and high school counselors and our college liaison to finish that to an associates not just taking random classes. As for the why don't we have more of them. Good morning I'll speak to not just the early college campuses that we have but in the cab county we do also have to technical high schools if you will that partner with Georgia Pete might technical college and other some online technical colleges as well. And those two campuses we have several CTAE or technical school pathways that students are able to complete and leave with those those industry credentials they're able to push into the workforce which is essentially what we want them all to be able to do whether they're leaving early college or whether they're leaving one of our technical schools we want them to push back into Georgia particularly in our district the cab and provide. Good citizenship to the community give back as good citizens as well and so in addition to the early college campuses we do have to technical high schools and then on a third campus that is for students with disabilities as well. Any other questions from the committee. So just out of curiosity if I could you mentioned 299 scholars that are in attendance at your school now how has the domain been through the last let's just say the last couple of years last five. Is that number been about the same or up or down or well when you factor in that the district went full virtual for about a year and a half. That sort of the numbers post covid were families wanting to stay in the same feeder pattern for the most part so it probably dip to two seventy but pre covid with the trends you saw in the school before I got there and I just picked up the baton and kept it going it was getting larger and larger at one point we had three hundred and thirty five students and that's really that's a fire marshal capacity at that point in the ninth and ten. It really is one hallway up in our central office so I can't take more that speaks to his other question about do you have more of them or you have one that's just bigger but again I am not in charge of the cab per strings but the numbers have ticked up every year after covid because we go out to schools and we promote even beyond just the school choice fairs that the district holds. Thank you all very much appreciate you being here. Thank you again. Thank you. We'll take this. Okay. So for the rest of our agenda we're going to be centered more around conversation amongst the committee and took the our senator parents suggestions as I value her opinion and she is certainly willing to share. And I love her for it so but it actually was very good idea we're going to the rest of the rest of our agenda we're going to we're going to spend the next thirty minutes or so. Talking amongst the committee and discussing recommendations and ideas and during that I am going to have a panel that will be available for us as a resource to ask questions. That panel can also if they have some suggestions you are more than welcome to make those as you're recognized and and then we'll take a little pause in about thirty minutes or whenever the conversation ceases and we'll allow the public to come forward and make some recommendations as we just had from our de cab from our de cab county there in the early college academy they made some suggestions so if there's anybody else in the public this present today that would like to make some suggestions recommendations that will be the appropriate time to do that. Then we'll come back and we'll come back in the committee will kind of will start to finalize our recommendations and what we want to put in our final report and then we will adjourn will have lunch available as usual right we got lunch we'll have lunch available for committee members as usual. And then we will come back for a fifth and final meeting to vote out the report or vote it down however the committee decides. But that one we will as long as the rules allow we will if you want to we'll have a virtual option for that so I know some of y'all drive a long way and so we will give you the option to not have to do that. So that's kind of the the where we're at and so committee or panel our panel experts are going to be Irene on mark with log and if y'all I guess come up to the podium and their seats there and and we got Chris Hatcher and Nathan Oakley. Yep there's yeah I mean whatever y'all do whatever we're easy. Does anybody have these just me in the committee okay all right. Okay and just for committee members committee members for your reference. Yeah let's take um Senator Williams. There's a lot of things going on there and then move. Leni move your stuff over and then there's an extra seat. There we go. All right so committee members there is a little outline in your folder that already has some some recommendations there and so that'll kind of give us a good starting point. Let's let's go through these point by point again the panel is here for questions so starting with number one if that's going to be the sunset on the current law current law being Senate bill 86 we put a three year sunset in that law and so you know the ideas if this program is going to work if we

can tighten it, tighten up, you know, these lists potentially get it down to one list instead of multiple lists and that's also on here as well. We can discuss that later, but you know, if we have a sustainable program, you know, the first ideal would be to remove that sunset. So does anybody have any thoughts on that? Yees, nays, pluses, minuses, represent towns. Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. One number, ye. Three. Okay. Got it. Go ahead. I do totally support that. I know in the first year may be hard, but if we do, minimally, that would be the go, I think to remove the sunset. I think we've heard enough evidence to see this would be a successful program. We want to make sure we're getting the right return on investment port, of course. If that's not possible, first year to make sure it's comfortable with it, then I would recommend that at least we extended a year to make it a roll over at least one more year and make it another three years based on high school counselors and they start advising kids. And they're great. We have some really good counselors in the state. They're going to be a little conservative on their advisement, right? And probably need to let Jill speak on this. Miss Oldham with her background. But they're going to be a little conservative and they can see all of a sudden this program going from three years to two year to one year. They're not going to advise any student to take advantage of this, afraid it's going to go away. So we'll have to either grandfather people in once they start it as a sophomore or make sure we roll it over if we don't approve this, if we don't approve the do away with sunset. So I do want to make sure we add this caveats in there. As we start talking about it, we don't do away with sunset in general. Then let's put some things in place to protect those students in there and give that make sure the counselors have the confidence to advise those kids. This would be a viable program for them to finish high school with. No, it's a great point. I think it would be hard to advise a child to go down this path if it's going to end in three years. Would you comment on that? You're certainly more than qualified. Thanks Rick, because that is my background and that's what I've done forever I think. If you cannot remove the sunset, then at least look at extending it three more years. Because during that time, my bet is that there's going to be a lot of conversation about restructure and reorganization of how we utilize the gifts that we've been given from dual enrollment and perhaps we would have time at that point to clean up and make it a little more fluid. But you're right about the advisement piece because you do get a little antsy when you're not sure if you're going to take a student part way and then the rules of the game will change or the whole game will change. So consider that. Okay. So I think when talking about a sunset, anytime we talk about a sunset, we need to sustainability is the key component. Scott and Mark, we've visited, you know, Y'all's programs. We've visited the nursing program in Chris down in Albany and then we visited the manufacturing program at the College of Encry Academy in Newden. Can y'all kind of talk to the sustainability? What do you see in your programs? I mean, is it paying for itself? Is it a good investment? I mean, we all know it's a good investment, but can you kind of maybe help us understand why it's a good investment? I'm not sure our microphones are working, so just speak loud. Mark, if you want to come up to the program. So I think from the standpoint in Albany and healthcare, and Chris can certainly speak to, with the gear funding, that's really allowed us to jumpstart the program and there's been a tremendous amount of growth and excitement amongst the high school students. We've got 17 seniors in the program, 36 sophomores, and more than 36 juniors and more than 70 sophomores. And so there's a whole bunch of interest in the program. The flexibility that it provides, and this will provide, and there's more behind that coming. So there's a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of momentum, and I think for our health system, we've got 250 nursing openings today, right? And we'll, new nurse coming out and these students can get their CNA by the time they're finished up with their junior year. We can employ them as 17-year-olds. If that's something that they want, they'll be halfway to their RN degree by the time they graduate high school and need one more year. They'll be 19 years old coming out. That's a bit frightening anyway, I haven't a 19-year-old, but they'll be ready for a job paying them $65,000. When the average income per capita income in Southwest Georgia is less than 25. And so this acceleration, hopefully it's a responsible acceleration of the programming is going to allow us to invest different dollars, our system to invest those dollars that today we're spending our contract labor for people that live in Frank-Quite-Frankly, live in other states. They're taking that income back that we pay them close to $100 an hour to take that somewhere else. And we're going to impact lives of people that live in Southwest Georgia, change it for their families in big ways. You can imagine coming out with full benefits and $65,000. That is going to do remarkable things for their family. So, family. So, I think we've already seen some early returns of it. And keeping that momentum, which I think number one eliminating that sunset would allow us to do that. So, of those, and Chris, you can speak to this too. Of those 17 that are in the program now, I mean, do you anticipate all of them either walking into a job or going to further their education? I mean, we probably talking about 100 percent there. Yeah, if they have the desire to stay there, which again, they live there. So, we're competitive. And if they can pass their NCLEX, they're going to have an offer. We've basically told them that. You get through the program and you pass your NCLEX. Phoebe Butty will have an offer for you. We'll take every single one of you. And it's Chris, you want to talk to your seniors? Yes, absolutely. And there is a lot of enthusiasm for this group. And just to clarify, eliminating these barriers, the gear funds did it precursor to SB 86. That was a governor's funds that just said, hey, let's put some money there in a pilot program to see if this can have impact. And then we moved to Senate Bill 86. And those two things are what calls this trajectory, just removing that barrier, removing student confusion to go from 17 to 36 and now to 71. Lots of enthusiasm. 100 percent of those kids are working, the 17 are working right now. They have their CNAs as seniors. They're working towards their 30 hours of dual enrollment. So, once they finish high school, they'll have 30 more hours towards their RN. And you heard the numbers, 250 nurses. They're open right now at an average salary of $73,000 a year. So, this is big time impact with very relatively small tweaks to this dual enrollment piece. Mark, what about from a manufacturing standpoint? What are we seeing there? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Of the 132 students that we had yesterday morning in accelerated career, half of them were in manufacturing related programs. We're seeing more and more manufacturers come to the table and not just in County to County. They're coming from counties surrounding when you all were at CEC. We had four counties who were represented who are looking for these students to a person. Every one of those executives said they would expand their operation if they could find the talent. One of those companies sent their talent leader, globally, from Germany, to speak to this committee. If there's any sense of what the need is, I think those kinds of numbers suggest that the need is greater than we can currently produce. Companies continue to come to the table. We work very closely with Georgia Tech in their manufacturing extension partnership. Georgia Tech tells us there's even more ready to come. We know for a fact that, for example, Frayer, $2.57 billion to be invested in County County. A part of the presentation was the manufacturing program. Any members, do you all have any questions for any of them? All right. Well, let's go down to the next point. So the next point is increase ability to gather data on high demand careers and determine a more efficient way to move keep with the times. Irene, you want to kind of tackle this one for us? Thanks. I love that question. Super quick history lesson around the idea of what you'll hear about the high demand career initiative started with Governor Deal. And the outcome of the high demand career initiative, and this is the best of my knowledge. I'm going to defer if I say something inappropriate to Technical College and Georgia student finance, but Governor Deal properly thought about how do we attract people into these critical workforce needs. I mean, CDL is the great example. So let's give them hope grant dollars and let's put a kicker on top called hope career grant. Why we decided to use different terminology between high demand and hope career grant. I'm not 100% sure, but that's truthfully what you guys are doing. So this definition of the list of high demand careers that are hope career grant funds extra money to pay for things over tuition costs. And they're critically important. And I'm thankful that Commissioner Dozier is here too. So jump up here and create me if I'm wrong. But if I'm going to be a welder, I have to have personal protection equipment. That calls me about $150 to buy boots in the shield and the gloves and all those things. Those are not covered by tuition costs. So there are extra expenses and the idea of bringing in additional funds for those individuals is just critical. But with the policy decision around what is in Nathan and his excellent ed folks call it high wage high high skill high demand. So that's your state your policy that's going across this country around those three the three H's or whatever they call it. But so a lot of states are thinking about what really are those. And and then just practically speaking y'all determine how do you determine what those are because you're giving extra money to incentivize a student to go in those programs. What we like to do at our college and career academies is always ensure that the programs that are being incentivized are those that are going to have high wage high demand jobs at the conclusion. Because our goal is to not let people just we want people to have jobs that are in the region's workforce and the the very structured program that puts them into that. So there is no doubt we just need to think about the strong policy conversations from the past and then bring them up to today's world and today's workforce need. And and there's a huge and I think our friends from Metro Atlanta Chamber did a great job of giving you the data around where those huge job openings. And if the truth of the matter is we probably got well over 400,000 current job openings today that require two years or less that are high skilled, how to man, how wage. Then you've got plenty of job openings that require a four year degree, but I'd suggest most of those are in the healthcare space. And so that's where you know we're we're trying to design these very strategic pathways to get to the jobs that are critically needed. And even to the point there's so many conversations that have been had you know with Phoebe how important it is. I think our friends said something about people go to four year university and 40% of our are those students are going out of state and don't stay in state. The desire is to ensure that these folks stay locally. And if they're in these very strategic strategically designed programming then that's where that's where they're end up or that's the purpose and the go especially if the employer is standing and walking with that student as they go through that path. So that was a long conversation. I got on a soft box a little bit but going back to the policy of that you guys probably need to think about are how do we what does it look like in 2023? What is high demand career initiative mean? What does hope career grant mean? What does hope grant versus hope scholarship pay for and just bring that into kind of 2023 and the workforce needs of our country of our state. Did I answer that? I think so. You did get on a soft box say you answered a few things. You answered some future questions. I'm sorry. Because you did touch on number six on these initial findings and recommendations on clearly defining high demand which I think we all agree that that's and one thing I've learned during this is that certainly I'm going to need to be done. I want to kind of back up a little bit around the gather data. When we were crafting SB 86 part of it was gathering data and one thing I learned during that process thanks to President Riley over here there was some data that was already out there that we weren't capturing and we were about to make her start capturing something that the technical college system already had. I'll take it a step further. We need to figure out a way for more data sharing and maybe one central location. One thing I do fear when we're doing we're talking about policy and a lot of what we do with the legislature we're putting down we're not putting down but we're forcing our you know we're forcing the system to do more work and so we've got to be very careful number one not to be replicating work not to be duplicating work and so I think it would be nice if we could figure out a way for this data sharing to get it into housed in one area and where that is I don't know and that's probably something we'll need to work through with the through the legislative process but I'm you know this if anybody has any suggestions now would be a great time. Commissioner Dozier we appreciate you being here if you if you have any comments were you have an open mic so at any point you want to jump up and comment you just stand up and I'll we'll get you recognized so and if you would I'd like you to be here's a resource for the committee to ask questions to you should should they have any so one thing to add one thing to add to that and then I'm going to for sure defer to the state agency heads that are sitting here but who's not here is the governor's office student achievement they do have the longitudinal data system and the data they are and again I'm looking at Leon here that y'all probably know better there there's some good data in the longitudinal data systems and so that there is a resource so as you're thinking about that does exist. Well that's good to know I mean I guess the other part of data is educational peace for us as policymakers because I've never heard of that so so that's good to know it's got it Chairman brass I was reading recently this the Georgia chambers new the new Georgia economy I don't know if you've seen that but it would it be okay if I hand out one page from that absolutely the committee and this one page or just sort of speaks to and granted data right depending on where it comes from it can be changed or manipulated or but I'd like to think the Georgia chambers just put it out there and and this speaks to some of the high demand and a bit self-serving health cares number one but you know but what it shows is what we've heard right health care manufacturing it talks about what 2023 2028 and then 2020 2030 making some sort of projections and current openings across the state and anyway I just wanted to I thought that those two slides and it showed sort of the ROI what degrees are providing ROI's today I was a bit shocked that that 37% don't have an ROI the definition of what ROI is and on here and I'm trying to work with chamber to better understand what that means is that in two years five years 20 years but it's a good report and as we talk about demand and high demand it could be just another indicator or an arrow of where we're headed with it well and I think to your point of understanding where where do these you know lists come from you know I think that's kind of what we're trying to get to is clearly defining it and then putting some metrics around it to define it because I mean look Georgia chambers very reputable and does great work but they may have had their five top engineering members come to them and say hey put us on the list and I'm not saying that's what happened but I'm saying that that that potential is always there and so you know we as a committee and then eventually we as a legislature and policymakers we're going to have to you know less clearly if we if we truly believe in this program and we we've got to make sure that it is sustainable and the first thing that can happen for something to become unsustainable sustainable is for it to expand without reason without without true data backing up why there's an expansion or you know it may just be somebody you know office says might have a buddy somewhere it says hey you know throw me on the list okay you know I mean that's those are the things we've got to figure out a way to to prevent and that's kind of what I'm charging all of us with is today and through the course of this process is what I would like to issue a report that makes suggestions to make sure we get a grip on this this program to make sure that it lasts for for attorney representative Evans um one thought that immediately came to my mind and stepping back and saying whatever's in the government governor's office of student achievement that's great I didn't know about that either but my thought immediately goes to what tcsg I understand already does which is every degree program they have has an industry advisory board and that industry advisory board reports and says we need more hay slow up we need less so that way that's why they have such a great graduation to job pipeline because they don't graduate people that are not in demand and not to get up on my slipbox for two seconds I think everything tcsg does is hide demand and so I don't even know why we do this but if we're going to have a high demand list I think tcsg board should be in charge of that personally and I think that we could codify that and have them do a report every year every two years and I think it they could also give us why are we taking this off why are we putting this on how many people have utilized this I think they could certainly not to throw work on them but I think they sort of already do a lot of this and so we might as well take advantage of it okay noted that's an idea yeah Commissioner you want to comment on that you want to tell me any time and that's the call back obviously as we navigate how we do handle what is high demand and not it's it is I think everybody's going to say that there's so much that it is high demand we do having an industry advisory board for each program at each college so that the local service areas are represented and specific needs are identified and I do think that is something tcsg implemented so many years ago that has been so critical to each of your communities is that we have a standard program that then matches a specific need to that local environment to make sure the person coming out is job ready so as we go forward just a reminder I don't have an answer for how you want to set up who identifies what a high demand job is obviously we do work with everybody and we have a good fill for that but also it is very difficult because right now with the low and the low employment and the great job opportunities in the state it seems like everything we train on is high demand in tcsg and so very very difficult but I am very proud that this body along with the governor your right Irene governor deal set up the 17 areas that we have been focused on for so many years but this body and the governor expanded that to 18 just a couple of sessions ago which included criminal justice and law enforcement academies and so I believe as we continue to look at this that is something that as we identify how to identify what's in high demand you know it's going to be hard to shrink it versus grow it it's just something that we would love to be part of we would like to sit at the table whether we're the lead or whether we're part of it we do think we have some expertise in that area thank you thank you commissioner I mean I do think I agree with you it is it is going to be harder to shrink it which is actually why would I think it's important that we come up with a way to to truly measure you know these high demands because you know if you know if we add something every time you know the political wind shift or or you know you know the AJC's running something in the paper you know all of a sudden we want to add something well at some point yes sir it's not going to it's not going to be sustainable anymore and things do shift as you're looking as we you know as we have different types of industries coming in things shift so I think it's very valid to have some group that's looking at that absolutely thank you yes sir yes sure chairman and I would agree with you both and I think one of the challenges is for those of you who know me you know everything in my life I want to be in a spreadsheet based on a formula right you put good data in you you make good decisions based on good data and I would love to to sit here and be able to say let's define it you know from a formula standpoint but I also think that that then can create a buzzsaw right right and that could create whiplash effect and I agree with representative Evans completely on what she said and and so I don't have that answer either but I think maybe the challenge is to Irene's point if there's data out there if the collective we sitting around this table you can't tell me we don't have the data to do this but in a sustainable way to to chairman brass's point and there is mr. chairman there's a ton of data and we do I think it was insinuated a few minutes ago and it is fact before we expand our open a program we not only work with those local industries we also run it against NZ data to see how many job openings are out there and that helps us determine to kind of yours we don't have the spreadsheet but it's kind of given us that spreadsheet of do we expand this class do we withdraw this class or bring it down so as we make those decisions it could play right into the high demand what what job openings are out there what's the turnover how's it going and I'll just end with this mr. chairman and I'm sharing the story with a couple of folks earlier you know my predecessor sat in my seat for 22 years went to work for linear tech in my district and he completely and utterly opened my eyes with one two hour visit with where my dad was with me as well and and the simple statement was there's not it and I think that's to to Scott's point here there's not a singular career or career pathway for for everyone but if we just use that statement and and tell them jump in the water yeah it doesn't do good whether you need our answers or you so the more clearly defined we can we can make things the more guardrails we can put there the opportunities that we clearly defined not not just this not just high demand but we we make these pathways easier I've referenced it before we went to noon and you put this this slide up there of how to navigate some of these programs were discussing I couldn't I could not walk my own child through it right let alone a constituent who were to call and say what the heck did you all do so I just I think there's a better way to you know mr. chairman when you're saying that and it plays a little bit into it but it may be a little bit of a rabbit I'll be quick you know we don't want to have a lost decade on anybody and that's kind of what we say is there's two things we want to be a first choice like any any of the institutions in here we want to be a first choice but we also don't want to lost decade if somebody's pathway matches to the job skills we train on we want to find them early in the process get them plugged in so that folks like Scott and others have that workforce at an early stage versus a 10-year loss where somebody then finds their way back to Scott that'd be perfect thank you thank you commissioner you know for I want to reiterate to the to the committee here you know we don't we as a committee and for our report we don't necessarily need to get into the weeds on what is the definition of high demand we don't because the truth is we're going to issue this report and then you're going to have 236 very opinionated people decide what kind of policy is going to move forward and and then one other very opinionated person is going to ultimately sign off on it or not sign off on it so you know so for sake of time and for sake of sanity you know we're we're we're going to make very high-level recommendations you know what we think should should take place we just don't necessarily need to get into how we think it needs to take place you know do we think data should be collected on high demand and that go into helping to find it that could be a recommendation but we don't necessarily need to jump into exactly what data unless you I mean if you want to if you've got some thoughts on that certainly share it and you know we can make that part of it but just for sake of you know we're not sitting here racking our brains you know because we could work on this for the next 24 hours for the next three years and not figured out so just wanting to throw that out there all right so I think we talked about that we talked about defining it if if no one has any other stuff the third comment here third recommendation says

is reporting that it's difficult for them to get work because companies are hesitant to employ minors. This is most likely because of the scheduling challenges and you're going to be the rest of that. So I certainly think that is you know, worth discussion. You know, I don't know. I guess the ultimate discussion there is what role does government have in that and marketing that, you know, if we in my mind, if we have you market the program and you know, not necessarily and then it would really kind of be up to our local, local partners to get out in their communities, which I think we pretty much do a pretty good job of that. Can we do better? Absolutely. I think part of that education is educating our local counselors at our high schools and middle schools and we can certainly do better at that at educating them and that is the role of government. And so, you know, and I don't want to get in a philosophical debate after the role of government but certainly feel like this deserves discussion and would love feedback from the committee. So yes, for represented baller, we eat four. Because I did, I talked to some kids and you know, if you're on the tech side of dual enrollment and you're, you know, getting a training for a trade, you've got your internships, you've got all this. But if you're, you know, using that your dual enrollment is to get ahead in college, you're not necessarily getting those internship offers. And I just thought it was worth talking to the kids who are out there that are kind of dealing with this. And that's just what they have reported and I don't have an answer to that. But I thought they deserve a voice. Right. And also the next one, as it was mine as well, from what I heard from the kids, they would like to be exposed to some of these career fields and career pathways even in middle school, like having more interaction in middle school so that they feel like they can make more informed decisions when they get to ninth grade. I mean, when I was in middle school, I was thinking about a job or a career pathway necessarily. But these kids are and they really do want to make some inform, be able to make informed decisions. And as we've talked about, it's a little complicated. And so I think that that's, that's really important. And that's just, I just wanted to report what my kids in the district were telling me. Okay. Are there any, do we know of any policy hurdles for exposing some of these middle school kids to, you know, to say a manufacturing plan on a field trip? Or I know there's probably going to be some issues with, you know, them getting in specific parts of the, of the manufacturing floor, but are there any other? I would say hurdles, no. I think we've been doing a lot of work that we also encourage the committee to consider around exposing students to career fields earlier on. We've started with, as we mentioned, at the last session, I don't think about things like construction courses and career courses in the elementary grades, just exposing them to what those options look like so that then they can start looking at courses and, and options for pathways even in middle school as they're thinking about their high school trajectory. I think another thing that you can consider as you're thinking about sort of this space and option for how do we expose students to careers and give them options, maybe thinking about something like a summer work-based learning incentive, our component for students, our work-based learning, a sentiment component whereby students are either getting credit or there's some sort of a grant or funding to incentivize the students and the companies for those work-based learning considerations and options that then become a part of their experience while they're in school. I love that idea of summer-based, summer work-based internship, things along those lines. That's great ideas. Is there any, I mean, panel, do y'all know, are we doing that anywhere or is anyone doing that? Chris. Just a couple of things. First of all, on the age, the 17-year-old, I mean their employers at the local level can make a lot of accommodation for that. I mean we've got students in the manufacturing industry that are working at 17 certainly at Phoebe, they change their rules to allow for certified students at the age of 17 to work on the floor. So there is a, I would encourage your students to talk to the folks in the school system, to talk to their local industry. There are some accommodations. I know there's a fair amount going on. I'll let Mark speak to that in NUNIN. As far as the other piece in just exposure, I mean we work closely with CTAE, you know, at the middle school level as well as a high school level, we love that piece of this education puzzle and that's a great time to explore at the middle school level and in fact our relationship with Phoebe, they have requested that we utilize our students to push down into the middle schools and to expose younger students to careers in health care and we're also doing that in other fields too. So I think CTAE affords a great way to really get that word out to our younger students. So I know you want to talk about 18. Mr. Chairman in the in the manufacturing sector, again working with Georgia Tech, which has an OSHA liaison. We were able to provide support to our local manufacturers to show what students can do, what they can't do. First of all, we've got great policy in Georgia in our State approved work-based learning program through CTAE. Dr. Wall has a tremendous program. We've got a tremendous registered apprenticeship program through our technical college system. We've got those structures in place. Now with that expertise from people like Georgia Tech, our employers have learned that students really as young as age 15, if we get the proper support from the US Department of Labor, can be in the manufacturing setting and have been. Manufacturing and mining probably the two most regulated and exclusive terms of age limits on students getting involved. But we've had students as young as 15 in manufacturing. It's worked well in that apprenticeship program. Thank you. Nathan, you traveled other states frequently. What are you seeing around what are they doing to educate the kids, the industry, and you're really connecting all the partners together. Are they doing any other states do anything with middle school kids to expose them to what's to come. And then some of work-based internships. Can you kind of comment on those jerseys items around other states? What you're seeing out there. So a lot of the points that you've touched on this morning are what we're seeing in other states. I'll give you a couple of examples. In the Northeast part of Mississippi for about the last six years now, there's been a partnership between Toyota Well Spring with the Toyota Plant and Blue Spring Mississippi and the Create Foundation where they deployed career coaches into high schools and those coaches were working primarily with middle with high school students. But there is some reach in the state down into middle school to help expose students to careers. But as a part of that, they're doing kind of long-term work-based learning experiences, particularly for students in career tech programs. But they're looking particularly for summer learning opportunities on the job in a local doctor's office or in a local law firm at a local manufacturing facility. Getting students exposed for a longer 8-10 week period in that particular career field where they may be interested. Before they end up in a two-year, four-year post-secondary setting. As a part of that career coaching model, they are also bringing local business and industry into the schools to visit with students to help them understand what the career opportunities look like in their particular region or community in the state and what career what education pathways are necessary to get there. So, both during the year as well as summer learning or our big components there, you've got to find solutions that work with the school schedule to your point earlier. And solutions that work to meet government regulations. There are some places that are looking at third-party temp staffing agencies who can carry insurance or workers' cop to eliminate some of the business or company concerns of those students or temp staff employees. They've found solutions that are workable to make that happen for students. I would also share in Tennessee back to the scheduling question companies and concerns about scheduling folks in for work. I'm familiar with at least one school in Tennessee where they have students that are near in the end of maybe their manufacturing program for instance who are in a focused program that includes half day of classroom instruction and a half day of work-based learning. And so essentially you've got two shifts of students. You've got a shift of students that start their school day at 7 a.m. and go to class until 11. And then they work in the afternoon and you've got another cohort of students that start working at 7 a.m. and then go to class in the afternoon. So essentially for every two students the manufacturer entity has a full-time employee in that space. And so there are some unique approaches. Many of these are not necessarily prohibited by any kind of policy but have just required people to think deliberately and creatively of how to create those opportunities for students. The one other thing I would mention for you on the middle school side is there is an allowance within Perkins funds now for those to be used down into middle school grades. Fifth or sixth grade I think can reach down that far. It's a limited pool of resources but another potential funding source for the state to say if we're really focused on exposing students in younger grades then do we have funds to do that and how do we do that more deliberately either through coaching advising a deliberate planning process not just to check the box kind of fill out the form and my student got exposed to careers but what does that really look like to be meaningful for students. Thank you. Any questions? Yeah. Kind of go along with that. Really the local school system really has to buy into it. The state concept of program or options it's kind of like U-science. Some people bought into it, some people didn't. The people are really gun hoe and successful by trying to get kids experience or trying to make sure that students in middle school understand the different career paths. How do we get some of these female students to understand what engineering is all about if they're not exposed to it or I understand that's a strength of their background and so we can send up things from the state but it's also a local responsibility to really buy into it and run with it. So as we go through this we just have to make sure we stain our lanes and support the local schools but that local control is so important and they really the local board's got to buy into it and fall through. Well and I think to your point too you know I think our role from the state level is to help educate the local systems on what is available you know what's working what's not and I've got a question maybe Tiffany you can help me with this one Miss Taylor I should say. Is there the local counselors is there like a continuing education credits that they have to get any kind of CE's or anything like that? For keeping their certification yes they obviously continuing learning credits for their certification. I think the four counselors in schools the issue is less of I think a wants our desire or understanding as it is capacity so even here in Georgia if you remember we just last year the governor put in the 25 million to fully fund school counselors and that just means that they're now funded at 450 students to one counselor so before that we were not funded at 450 to one which means we had a larger amount of students that were assigned for every counselor and hopefully now we get closer to that 450 you want. 450 students to one counselor is still a lot when you're talking about navigating both their whatever their K-12 experience their social needs their behavioral aspects their scheduling and now I'm talking about the career aspect of it as well so when we're talking about career coach option and maybe bringing in career coaches that focus just on that career aspect to then that also a freeze up those school counselors to focus on those school counseling needs and those career coaches to focus on those career aspects that are so necessary for the conversations we're having right now. So going back to those continuing education credits that they've got to get for their certification or does the department ed y'all set that? That's the professional standards professional standards commission because I'm just kind of thinking out loud here since this is the proper time to do that is you know what if there was a continuing education credit they could get to where we had someone a representative from TCSG come in and I guess in higher ed and really all the players around dual enrollment and kind of discuss these types opportunities I mean would that be helpful do you think? Well I think you know you could certainly be something that you consider I think our counselors also I mean they do a professional learning around dual enrollment regularly throughout the year they participate in professional learning both with we have a dual enrollment specialist at the department that works with them but also with our partners who are with us today that meet with them regularly as well so again I think it's that their exposure to the information I think it's more about their capacity to it but again an increased exposure does not hurt. Okay. Are the middle school counselors are they being exposed to this just like the high school? They are being exposed to and not to the extent as the high school counselors but they are. Okay fair enough. Hey Chairman if I can add to that you were talking about the PC earlier and I made it for a jail but from what I remember when I had counselors as a principal and CEO back in the day they didn't have specific things like you're talking about for the career in tech build the local school system did have areas where they could up their game as what you're talking about giving those people inside the schools with TCSG always and says the worst system Georgia they were very good about coming out of schools we invited a man this had to be invited in half the time and then a lot of systems now are started to teacher extensure externship programs where the teachers in the summer are getting a stipend to go into the industry whether it's healthcare it manufacturing. Exactly. That's great. And that's something we can really somehow incentivize that'd be great from the state to push it. I know they talk about it at different conferences like CTAE I know they do it. Dr. Walsh talked about it plenty of times others have to again it goes back to the local decisions of some people buy into it and they support it others just say not for us. Well and I think going back to earlier point Irene when she was on her soap box I think just simplifying it could help get more buy in you know it's hard to it's hard to buy into something you don't understand and you know we're around it from a policy standpoint we as legislators are around it and then you know to Chairman Dubnex point we look at that chart and have no clue what that I mean I don't I don't fully understand it and so I do think simplifying the process will be a huge component of of more more folks having when when they are exposed to it now they're going to understand it because it's simplified and I think that could help the marketability of the whole program as well. All right let's get down clarity in the system actually we just discuss that you know I think and we've discussed this in previous committee hearings about you know simplifying maybe going down to to one list instead of what three I think we have two we got two lists right now if we could maybe simplify that down to one that's one piece of that you know Irene maybe I'm going to bring you back up let's get back on your soap box here what other suggestions you know you you mentioned simplify it we got hope career grant we got hope to talk a little bit more about that for me. Number one is making sure that you understand are you talking about the traditional high school path or you're talking about accelerated career because there's two ways to graduate from high school and now there are three different funding sources to pay for dual enrollment you have dual enrollment funds which is cash that's wonderful because it's cash that y'all are sending down then you have hope hope grant and hope career grant so that's what kind of makes it confusing and the idea the policy conversation around what y'all did do with dual enrollment was wide open anybody could take whatever class and we had random acts of dual enrollment what our college and career academies would like for you to do if it is have very strategic workforce driven high demand high wage high skilled acts of dual enrollment that lead to the jobs and so if you were able to fund those very streamlined clear paths that are funded by dual enrollment or hope grant dollars from the state level so a ninth grader who knows are going to step into the feebie health care path there's never going to be any issues about funding that comes down I have a clear path into an orange job at the age of 19 at VB Putney Hospital that's easy it's just easy this is a program that we have at foresee academy it's easy and that's where we would love for y'all to drive to these very clear high demand paths and this is our recommendation around where CTAE is the foundation of exploration that leads to a two year associate degree and that every parent and ninth grade student knows that if they do want a college path of four year degree that's available to them and they are the ones that decide to get off into a well paying job not somebody making that decision for them and again when you're counseled at the high school level you only you very much only see short term gains you only see high school diploma and don't know what's next or you see a strategic technical college path and not really sure what's next you really don't see that I can go all the way to a four year degree if if we choose because we have silos and and again we have random acts of great partnerships they're fabulous would it would it help and would it even be possible if we simplify the funding I mean it seems like that could be causing issues if in a in a way but that's a big big big lift for y'all to do and well that don't scare me okay well in our ask and our recommendations are based upon working with what we have right what we have is a very smart doing romance scheme in house built 444 that was the smart smart smart thing y'all could have done 11th and 12th grade very focused on core academics and then access to technical path Senate Bill 86 using working with what we have is the last frontier on using what we have to fix what we would love to see as it relates to a traditional high school path in an accelerated career path but in the big huge scheme of things very strutty and I some some say is the chicken or the egg how do you incentivize and this is one of our recommendations strong CTE lead to two plus two arrangements and right now we have pockets of that when it's locally driven decision making but there's no real overarching guide and if I got friends here y'all don't like what I'm saying jump up but there is you know there's it's just they're not the air their pockets and it depends on where you are and who your counsel is and what program it was or how active do you have a strong you know who's your strong post secondary partner there's there's there's three legs of every stool in the decision making strong high school CTA secondary strong post secondary and even stronger business community sitting there designing that program that's what a college and career academy does for you at the regional local level and and all of those best practices CTA has regional advisory boards local advisory boards technical college has advisory boards locals have these advisory boards and everybody's working with different tools so you tell me we don't need to recommend another advisory board no yeah okay all right well anybody have any questions comments yes I mean it seems kind of like if we were really going to take a look at it and I love you throwing out big ideas like all right let's you know the system grew up in like fits and starts and pieces added over time I mean it kind of seems like certain things are within our committees ability right now and certain things that may be very worthwhile may require a study committee number two right to just sort of do let's talk about this piece of it we've got you know as I said all these things that kind of got layered on top of each other and and they they work very well in some areas but they're not accessible in other areas and they're very confusing on top of all of it and I'd love to see us try to take some steps to at least have the you know on number five I like how it says at least make it as user friendly as humanly possible with what we have right now and maybe do talk about is there are there ways that we could especially if we get some of this ROI data then that could be a catalyst to look at improving the system and the funding streams and the accessibility more broadly okay any you kind of give me another thought is you know three time with any program or anything that we do around here it develops and I'm speaking specifically from a policy standpoint might start in one code section and then through the years you've got different laws throughout all different code sections and so from a fundamental standpoint maybe it would help simplify things if we start to unpeel that and then house it in one code section maybe that's something I mean from a policy standpoint that's something we could do you get it under one code section and then at least you know what you're looking at and then you can start to simplify from there so that's just the thought but but I know we've run into issues with other other programs and other laws that is just it's all over the it's all over the code book and you just it's so hard to to you know really dig in and figure out the problems when they're when just within the law they're all over literally all over the book so just a thought all right so I think we've covered that number six define high demand I think we've covered that number seven safeguard ensure that if students can use dual enrollment K through $12 they do before using any hope grant dollars I'm gonna say that again safeguard to ensure that if students can use dual enrollment K through $12 they do before using any hope grant dollars is that who made that recommendation that was me and I may have been using the wrong language but my my concern came my hello my concern came because I know there are some things that you can't use maybe general budget dollars is a better way to put it and so you you counsel the student you counsel the parent hey you're using a limited pool of hope grant dollars but and maybe it's already there but just that if anybody accidentally sends something through to the hope grant side when we know the system knows it could be coming out of general fund that that that's just in the system it's not something that a student or a parent or a counselor has to catch that's that was my it's sort of a technical bank account maybe issue I don't know unbelievably valid and thanks to the technical college system of Georgia and the high school coordinators that work with all of these programs every program across the state they now have this very strategic spreadsheet that starts the countdown of 30 hours of dual enrollment and then access to hope grant and so it's up to a good counselor but you have multiple counselors looking at that and ultimately those funds are going to the post secondary partner and so they're kind of like the final step to ensure that that that is used appropriately but that is probably that is so true and it's but it's also not my concern about the way you said it though is the fact that the whole purpose of Senate Bill 86 was to ensure you can grab the technical before you relax this 30 hours because the and again if you have a very strategic plan if you're doing random acts of dual enrollment then who knows what kids are choosing but if you have a strategic pathway that's designed like the foresee or the or this into high demand jobs we know exactly what is used for academic and we know exactly what is used for technical and there you've gotten rid of the concern about 30 versus access to hope grant and one of the other things that we're making a recommendation on the protection of misuse around going against the hope cap that we're not asking for that to go away because we want students to be unbelievably strategic and understand that we're not out here for you just to grab our or so that you can just pick whatever college courses you want we're here to get you highest level in post secondary education into the workforce and you got to design that very strategically so that's that is what we'd love to drive through where you see every single high school student have access to it here's the health care pathway that gets you fast here's the the skilled trade pathway that gets you here's the timber management if I'm down in coastal here's the this here's the that that's strategically designed CTA E2 plus 2 yeah I still would like I think it's an IT solution to be honest and because I think about it used to be that you couldn't that Pell and hope would cancel each other out luckily that change but I know this this is a long time ago Irene back when I was in college because I had both and they're and and if they if they both covered like for example I had hope so I literally lost some Pell dollars because they covered

Same thing, that doesn't happen anymore. You can use the hope dollars, or you can use the pelle dollars for other things, but the point is, if pelle can cover it, there's something in the system that makes sure it does. And then you get the other money on top of that. So there's a way to do it. And I think if a counselor or somebody or a student has decided to go in this pathway, and it's just a mistake, and they've started using this, what I view as one of the most precious piles of money that we have in the state, which is the hope grant. And somebody knows, or the IT system, knows that those dollars could have been coming from this other system. I just want to make sure it happens. That's all. Yeah. It's weird now. Yeah. Sure, absolutely. So to me, this, if it's not something that we heard about until today, so I hope I'm not jumping us down a random path. But I am curious about the suggestion from to Cap or like college saying, hey, we're not really going to be able to get above whatever it was going to be, like 55, 65% of kids getting their AA because they can't access the hope dollars, student enough. And I don't know which is kind of the problem we were addressing in 86, right? So I don't know enough about that. But I mean, what is the, and would like to learn more, but about why that gap then opened up, especially if you are taking things in a streamlined fashion so that it is pushing you toward we want to get you this, this associates to agree before you graduate. You're not just doing it for random exit or enrollment. What are the downsides of that type of, of looking at that type of arrangement as we're looking at allowing it for the career side? Do we know? I mean, when we did 44, 44, I was bothered because we were making those decisions without data. And I understood. Sounds like you got another study committee going. Well, I mean, I don't know. I got you up between now. I don't know if it's that detail, but just in something for us to consider, you know, thinking about. Right. Now, I mean, my nori leader met a great point, you know, that is one of the purposes of this study committee. And one of the reasons why I think the recommendation of simplifying the system is important. Would you like to further touch on that? Madam leader? I don't know. OK. Ah, that was a great comment. Thought it was a great comment, and I thought it was worth sharing with the world. So it's out there. All right. All right. So number eight, make the program's permanent. Again, that's talking about the sunset on 86. I think we've kind of covered that. You know, yeah. So I'm guessing we want that. Somebody wants that sunset off. So all right. Recommend funding for more TCSG instructors. Better pay because there is a shortage. Commissioner Dozier is over there grinning. Did anybody who made that recommendation would they like to touch on it, represent Ravens? It was me. In the thought being, it sounds like, and I was surprised to learn this coming in this committee, that the dual enrollment is more utilized on the academic side to sort of get some courses out of the way before you go to a four-year school. But for our, for as a state, we know that we have shortages in areas where you get trained to do those jobs in technical college. And we need to encourage more students to go to technical college than we currently do, than it's currently happening. But the problem is, once we do that, they're going to get there, and there's not going to be enough instructors. And the only way to make sure that the technical college system, I think, is ready for hopefully the demand that we should start pushing to them is better pay. Because if you're an instructor in a high, I mean, this is sort of the chicken in the egg, because we want them to teach kids, because it is a high demand area. But because it's a high demand area, that instructor can go get a much higher salary out in the marketplace. And so we've got to account for that, if we're going to try to flood the market with more workers. Any other comments from the committee? Questions? OK. Number 10, placing a definition of high demand career that is automatically updated into code, or referring to a regularly updated list generated by an agency or state board. I think we've kind of covered this as well. Is there any other further comments on that? It sounds like there's multiple folks that want this, myself included. Number 11, take steps to simplify and streamline a complicated set of options for students and ensure seamless movement between K-12 College and Career Academy. It's TCSG institutions and USG institutions. I think we've kind of discussed that as well. Is there any other further comments, any suggestions, on how we could simplify? Of course, I think that's, we've talked about maybe simplifying it just simply within code. Potentially simplifying the funding. And then certainly some other options as far as policy around what is dual enrollment. I think number one, I think defining it, having one list is going to be some fundamental things we can do to help simplify any other suggestions on that. Certainly now would be the time, but that's one of those things we can let kind of work through the legislative process, work with our agency heads and determining how we're going to do that. It's sure, Jill, go ahead. This is actually one of the reasons I suggested not just eliminating or getting rid of the sunset, but extending it for a number of years, like three. Because right now we have a collection of entities all with their own purpose and their own rules and their own goals. And until we can back up and get the clarity piece, we're never going to see any improvement or any change. We're just going to keep running the same track around and around. And we'll be back to have this very same conversation again. Unless we change our actual approach from the ground root up, there's really no point in continuing with the same circus. If you don't step back, and I love the ROI thing, because when I was in the school system, I really tried to get some of that for my own school. I wanted to see how to make it better, how to make it go, how to make it great for kids. And we searched a number of entities. We looked at SREB. We ended up with, went to model schools. We did a number of things, but the truth of the matter was, I could have done all of that, but nothing changed policy-wise. Nothing was different outside of my building. So unless you guys are ready to really have the conversation, push the funding down the road for a piece, and then decide about your study committees that apparently happen. I don't understand what change we're thinking will be affected. Maybe Nathan, is there some policy things you're seeing in other states where dual enrollments, simpler process, than the way we've gone about it? Is there, I'm not to put you on the spot, but you're on the panel, so I'm putting you on the spot. Thank you. So streamlining the courses to ensure that there's articulation is a good first step. Are the courses that are available do the articulate from K-12 to all the two year, to all the four year programs? There's a consistency and a guarantee of the articulation for students. And do those courses count regardless of the program the student is taking, or in the overall majority of the courses students are taking. The pathways that students may take. That's one way to try to rein in the cost and to improve the benefit to individual students. To use the term we've heard several times this morning and repeatedly in other states, to minimize random acts of dual credit. Students get enrolled in courses just because that's where the counts are. Put them without any sense of how it's going to help you down the road. So ensuring that the courses that are funded, that the courses, if they count on your state accountability model, if there are benefits to those or incentives for those that you rein that in, that's a good first step. The other piece of it that came up in the question, the discussion last week, was, do those articulate not just within the community college system, but they're accepted within the four year system as well. So that you've got one of the students, if we've talked about moving down a pathway, I completed a two year program, and then maybe ultimately completed a four year degree. Well, well, the courses that I took as a part of that two year is there a guaranteed articulation into a related pathway in the four year system. You will get into accreditation questions and all other kinds of topics there, but those are two places that I would look closely as you're trying to consider dual credit. Great points. So Derek and Art, we got four year to year, talk to us about what is the feasibility of making that? What can we do as policymakers? What can the legislature do to make that happen other than just mandate? Y'all do it. Like, how do we make your job easier to where we can make this happen? Sure. And there's a lot of that good work going on already. I mean, between, it's on really started at the local level. There's 35 agreements right now, the two plus twos that Irene kind of talks about whether students take that pathway, starting in high school through TCSG and then transfer to that four year institution. So there's the work going on. I think it's really from our end kind of helping kind of create those conversations on either bigger statewide level, or also like I said, in really helping us target where these key areas need to be of focusing on certain pathways. If we, if y'all look at and as you talk about identifying here's what's in demand, helping, like I said, align those so that we can have those conversations of listen, we're all going to be on the same page, moving forward. So we create more of those two plus two options for students that may come to us and then decide, you know, at midway through how I'm going to continue on, how can we help kind of move that along? Let's figure out what some of those key areas might be. So. I've just echo what Derek was saying. And my understanding is that there is a conversation happening between the chancellor of the university system and the commissioner of TCSG. I guess I have to go behind me, but you're doing something to confirm that. And also to Derek's point that, you know, in preparation for our last meeting, it was clear that there are excellent articulations in place that are models. And it may be a matter of looking at them all at some data that was tossed out to me after our last meeting was the number of students that transfer between TCSG and USG. And the opportunity, therefore, to dig a little deeper and look at that process, how well is it working for students, what does that articulation look like? But especially to look at the ones where we know it's working well, where there's strong relationships between CTAE, TCSG, College of Career Academy, and the USG institution. There's great examples of that. Commissioner Dozier. Yeah, great. Appreciate, Art, making sure I got up here to speak. So I'm a kid and I always appreciate the chance to speak, especially on articulation. I think that that point is so, so vital. I think if we want our kids and our parents and our communities to have the workforce as quickly as possible and also not, I don't want to say waste because you always learn something but not have to take additional credits to get where they want to go and have somewhat of that lost opportunity articulation as a key. One of the things just looking at TCSG and our K-12 partners, CTAE, love Dr. Wall support this past two years. Just being honest, TCSG did not have any articulation with CTAE prior to two years ago. Two years ago, we have worked really hard during this pandemic. So Bill and Roman, yes, articulation. CTAE by itself, no. But we have over 18 agreements now. We're working on several others. Those agreements fit just what this committee's talking about. They are high demand areas, such as welding, electricians, criminal justice. They are important areas to make sure folks are getting the job skill they need to go and be employed and make a live voyage. So articulation is going from the lowest level as far as when you talk about three systems of someone taking just a CTAE course in our K-12 system, coming to TCSG, getting college credit, doing enrollment, just speaking on that real quickly. TCSG has been blessed this past year. We had 35,000 of the Dillon enrollment students. When you look at that, one of the goals that we have is that we have a retention rate of students coming to us and staying with us. We're not where we want to be, so don't miss hearing me. But right now we have a penetration rate into our high schools of about 7% of those students that aren't Dillon-rolled students. Dillon-rolled students, those that stay with us beyond Dillon enrollment is 15%. So we double that up. But this is the kicker. We do have good pathways into USG because over 40 something percent are going on to USG. At the state-wide level, when you look at articulation between TCSG and USG, we have 28 courses that are from a state-wide level accepted across both systems. As Derek said, we have a vast number of agreements at the local level. I have asked and spoke to the chancellor about statewide 2 plus 2s, what that means is what you're talking about. Some may take two years with us. They don't lose any credit. Go into university system and pick up and do two years and have their four-year degree. I would love to see us take some of these 35 there at the local level. Push up some that makes sense for the whole system. I don't want to speak for the chancellor. I don't know where he is on that. We've just spoken about it. But I'd love to see some of those push up to the system level. That may mean some of the USG colleges don't participate. But if we could have a system-wide that hits most of them, that would help that fluidity of our students making it through the pathways. So I think it's a great idea or something we should look at. Absolutely. Where are the assembling blocks or limiting factors where we only have the certain number of 2 plus 2 arrangements? Yeah, I think it's just just so complicated. I don't really like the comment like X and Y university may not participate. I mean to me that's not acceptable. I think if there's a certain course that might be but otherwise I don't that's not good for for George at all. Yeah, I don't know that it's system-wide it is complicated. We just got to grow into it and that's probably not a great answer either. But that's the reality. I think our local colleges have paved that pathway for it to happen because it's not complicated at the local level. When you have your chief academic officer, I'll just use a Gichi tech and Georgia Southern. We have these all over but I'll just use that one as an example. You set down your chief academic officer of both institutions looked at engineering pathways and we now have any student going through a Gichi tech and gets a two-year engineering pathway can go right over to Georgia Southern and pick up where they left off. And so we're growing that each and every day. It's not complicated. We just got to have in my opinion a little a little more focus and get these done. Thank you. Yes ma'am. Great. Yeah, I could test that too. In the coast, college, coast of Georgia, they do have the articulation and criminal justice and I know they're working on one for health care as well. That's a big thing in our area. I'm sure out there is for those two partners. It really takes the two schools in the area to get along with each other. That's what matters. Yeah, and I'll brag on coastal college. They launched that and really partnered with coastal pines and some men and a few others but they've opened that up to our system. So we have some of the some of the USG systems that have actually opened up to all 22 colleges on those agreements. So they're moving in the right direction. We just need to make sure we keep them moving. Well, I think the senator parents point it shouldn't take that. Yeah. You know, I don't think that's I don't think too conflicting and I agree with senator parent is shouldn't take to government officials that don't like each other. That shouldn't be a factor here because I mean our education assistant is Georgia's out. I'm not pointing any fingers. I don't care for some record. It's the truth. But that and again, I mean, I think the the whole point here is the role in my mind, the role of government is we're here to provide opportunity for these kids and it shouldn't personality shouldn't weigh into this. And and I'm not again, I'm not pointing fingers at anybody. But I think that's kind of the point of what we're getting at. And if we're going to have articulation, which we clearly need, you know, we're going to have to get the personalities out of the out of this factoring into to the agreement that shouldn't shouldn't matter. Yes, sir. So thank you. Just my commissioner. Yeah. That's just what I saw. And again, I don't think we're I don't think we're pointing fingers and I don't know that's not what we're here to do. We're here to to, you know, study a study issue, study an issue and make some recommendations on how to make it better and how to make it sustainable. And so absolutely. We appreciate you being here and helping us guide us through this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay. All right. Let's see. Next on the list. Now, look, I said 30 minutes and then we were going to get into public comment. Nobody actually signed up for public comment. Was there anybody? I'll take a quick break. Is there anybody out there that would like to say something? Dan, come on. Yes, sir. Former center. Really appreciate the work you all are doing. We think it's very important. I'm Dan Weber. I'm the executive director of the charter system foundation. Just a little bit about us. We're a non-profit that supports the 48 school systems in Georgia that are charter systems. We have a team of three retired superintendents that do flexibility and governance training for our districts. We also now have a three-member team that we call our career development team. Irene is part of that. We have Eric Waters from North Georgia, Floyd County who retired from the college and career academy. And in South Georgia, we have Sean Utley who has experienced in K-12 and now works part time with wiregrass technical college. These folks are out working with Derek's team at TCSG, Ben McHumber and Paul Samen meeting with districts to teach districts about these career pathways and in particular accelerator career because most districts, counselors and so on don't know about it throughout Georgia. You have to pose the question how do they find out about it and we're working to do a spread the word. For the last two years, we've had monthly web X's. We now have as many as 80 or 90 people registered each month. That conversation is led by Irene and Mark Whitlock plays a key role in that as well. We try to promote what CEC is doing in Caledia. We try to promote what Phoebe and Forci are doing down in Dordey County to our other districts. So we have some model districts now in North Georgia and South Georgia that are moving forward down this pathway. And they need your help to remove some of these obstacles. One of the, I try to put myself in the shoes of a high school counselor, counseling a student. One of the odd things is you can look at list of approved TCC pathways for accelerator career. I think it now numbers 18 and you can get an accelerated career to plum on that. But the counselor can then show you a list called the high, the hope career grant list which has a much more extensive list of certificates for which you can get the kicker, the additional money. Now under Georgia law, as it currently stands, that more extensive list is considered to be high demand. Maybe there are things on there that need to be removed. But we're promoting the idea that the districts that are moving forward need that list to be approved sooner expanded and improved sooner rather than later. We have districts with students who want to pursue these pathways and sooner you can do it. For example, Fulton County, which is a charter system, you may or may not know that in college part, they have taken the old Maclayer in high school. Last year and this year, I know how much you're spending that might be tens of millions to completely rebuild that school. Their goal is to open August 5th of next year with 400 accelerated career students, which will they will come from the other five high schools in South Fulton. That's a tall task for those counselors. They need the tools in place now to make that happen. They need the opportunities, the expanded opportunities that they can present to their students. Because right now those counselors should be working with those students who want to make that choice going forward. Another thing I wanted to say is when we talk about what other states are doing, there are good models in Georgia now with some of our districts who have developed extensive, very impressive best practices. CEC comes to mind, 4C comes to mind, they go to Kutusa County, Evans County, Evans County starts in elementary school. Each year, one career field is explored by those students. In sixth grade, they take a full year course. In seventh grade, they take a full year course. In ninth grade, they're required to take a full year course, all looking at career options. So we have excellent models like that here in Georgia. One other more specific thought I'd like to share with you. If I'm a counselor and I need to counsel between academic dual enrollment and technical dual enrollment, I have to tell you that if you use academic dual enrollment, funded by dual enrollment funds, that won't count towards your 127 hour cap combined hope, grant and hope scholarship that applies. But if you start taking a hope grant dollars in high school, that does count against your cap. That's going to be a distance center for that student to choose the technical pathway. I think that needs to be corrected. The way I would correct it would be to say in Georgia law, whatever you take, hope grant dollars or dual enrollment dollars, the first 30 hours will not count against your cap. It's your choice. That eliminates that barrier for that counselor sitting with that family and that student and puts technical pathway on equal footing with the academic pathway. So those are the thoughts I wanted to share. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Any questions for Dean? Okay, appreciate that. All right. All right, back to our list. Was there anybody else from the public like to say? Nobody signed up, but now would be your time. So, okay. All right, back to our list. Number 12, discuss conducting a thorough ROI analysis of career academies and dual enrollment. We've, I think we've kind of covered that. Sure. For Nathan, you had described, I believe, last meeting the process that Mississippi went through, and I know you were obviously our main speaker that was a big proponent of doing the thorough ROI analyses. Can you remind me what Mississippi did and how they did it because I don't have any clarity in my mind on how we would take our first steps and what sort of agency would need to do it or outside academic auditor or what have you. So, Florida Tennessee, Mississippi, have all done this. Florida's and Mississippi's both ended up in legislation. Mississippi's actually originated in legislation. The Office of Workforce Development in Mississippi was tasked with doing, with conducting the analysis, working with other partner agencies that were sources of the data. That was which state office of workforce development. Mississippi, okay. So, Workforce Development Office conducted the analysis, but they actually contracted that out with the state launch tool data system. The Workforce Office, we were small group, did not have the data capacity, did not have a data set, but we were able to through an existing contract work with our SLDS to look at the K-12 data, the program data, the enrollment data, same kind of information from the post-secondary signer community college system, and then to look at outcomes from labor wage data, government service program data to see what the outcomes for those individuals looked like a year after completion. And the initial analysis was over a five year period with the big caveat that there was a pandemic in the middle. Thank you. Nathan, why are there? So, when they were in Mississippi or other states, when they were looking at high career or high demand careers, I mean, our lives certainly can't be the driving data point. I mean, that's not the emphasis, right? Now, the ROI is a way to look at the programs you've got, and whether those are actually matching up with high wage, high demand, high skill careers. And if, in fact, maybe they're matching up with careers that are in high demand, but the wages for those careers are really low. Well, is this where we need to put our funding as a state if we're creating pathways and incentivizing students into low wage jobs, maybe not? Do we need to look at careers that pay well, that are in demand, or maybe they're careers that pay well, but there's only 12 of them in the state. Do we need 25 programs that lead to those? Probably not. It's about being better stewards of the resources you have to position people for success down the road. Gotcha. Okay. Any questions for Nathan? All right. Okay. 13, extend SB 86 for three years. I think we've covered that. 14 high school councilor funding. We kind of touched on that. Tiffany touched on that on we did this year and this year's budget. We did fully fund that, and I think we can always do better. And so something we should certainly look for.

you know, maybe there's some sort of, I don't know, add on funding or additional funding if they were to have extra training in these areas would be something that would be, could be discussed. So, sure, Jill. You actually can get a credential added on, not through the state, through a private entity for career counseling. So, that might be something they want to think about adding at each high school or at least to the district. Are you saying add funding for that? Should they- I have at least one person who is credentialed and able to go and do some of the extras that need to be done. Okay. The assessments. Measurement. I'm slower than that. More like what Miss Taylor was talking about where there are a separate career code. Most likely it would be a counselor with the added credential of a career specialist. And in my version, have at least one for school, is what you were saying? If I had all the money in the world, I would have one for school. But in reality, one for district might be helpful, but not as useful. Well, I think from a policy standpoint. Well, I'm always thinking in Rockdale too, we only have a handful of high schools. So, you would have to obviously decide how many per student you would want. I think every school district is different. And certainly the resources are different. And maybe from a policy standpoint, if the legislature and the governor ever wanted to go the route of, say, mandating either that credential or a career coach, give them the option of what's best that that might be certainly worth looking at. So, well, all right. So it's 12 o'clock. We have certainly discussed a lot of these recommendations. Committee members, are there anything else? Is anybody thought of anything else that you would like to be discussed as we issue a final report? And I'm going to talk with Chairman Dubnik after this. If he's got a quick minute, and we'll kind of figure out a structure of how we're going to issue the report. But it could look several different ways. We may just present all this in one report. And we have a discussion and vote it up or down. Or we may go point by point and vote each point up or down. But we'll use the Chairman's discretion on that one. But we'll do it in a timely manner. I don't anticipate the next meeting last and long in 30 minutes. So, we'll get with all y'all on figuring out a time and then issue our public notice on that and do it the proper way. So, is there any further discussion on any of these points, anything that we must that committee members would like to see added? Now would be the time because if you up know we're going to adjourn. Okay. Seeing none. Well, again, this has been a great discussion. It's been beneficial for me, I hope it has for you. And I appreciate everyone's participation. I appreciate everyone's really engaging in this process. It's been a very educational for me, certainly. So, again, thank y'all and with that, this meeting's adjourned.
