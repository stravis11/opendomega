TRANSCRIPT
----------
We start this part of the show with
information on a home loan program and
get an update on disaster relief.
Joining us is Republican Representative
Clint Crowe of Jackson. He chairs the
House Public Safety and Homeland
Security Committee. He's a former law
enforcement officer and currently a
second generation realtor. Also here is
Representative Derek Jackson of Tyrone.
Among other things, he's a retired
military officer with the US Navy. His
committees include defense and veterans
affairs, budget and fiscal affairs
oversight. It's a long name, but welcome
to the lawmakers.
>> Thank you for having us.
>> I appreciate that. We're going to start
with you and this ro this Georgia dream
peach advantage loan program. It
launched last July for home bon home
buyers. So tell us a little bit about
what it's what it means and how people
can get involved. So, so Georgia Dream
program we're talking about the um
DCA, Department of Community Affairs,
administers this and there's a lot of
different programs to uh help provide
loans, specifically loan programs for
first responders, police, firefighters,
EMS, um teachers, military veterans, um
they have some down payment assistance
programs, and you know, I've had some
legislation last year uh that increase
the cap. So the way they fund these is
by selling mortgage revenue bonds. Um
and it's actually authority an authority
with the state that's not backed by the
full faith and credit of the state.
Okay?
>> But the authority that is um set up
through the uh that DCA manages and uh
it's a fantastic program and they've
really and I'll tell you one quick
story. We had a uh young firefighter and
a school teacher trying to buy their
first home this fall and they were
getting a a USDA loan from the
Department of Agriculture. Right as they
went to submit their paperwork, the
federal government shut down.
>> No.
>> And they were in a real bind because the
seller needed to move on. Uh and so we
were able to move them over to the
Georgia Dream program and they able to
rush it and get them through and so they
were able to buy their home. U and
there's tons of stories like that that
we've seen. It's a real advantage. Where
do people go to get more information on
it and to sign up?
>> So, a lot of different lenders in the
state. You can talk to any mortgage
broker. Um, most of them can uh
underwrite these through the Department
of Community Affairs. Uh, but you can
also go on the Department of Community
Affairs website and check out the
Georgia Dream program and they can help
you uh find a lender that can walk you
through the process.
>> Okay. All right. Then, we'll I'm sure
there'll be people getting on the phone
or going on their computer right now.
Representative Jackson, we're gonna
completely change directions here
because you're here to talk about
legalizing cannabis, uh, recreational
cannabis, right?
>> Yeah.
>> Tell us about it.
>> So, uh, and I appreciate, uh, being on
lawmakers and for my bill, it spells out
the difference between decriminalization
and legalization. Okay.
>> My bill is solely on decriminalization.
simply meaning that if you have 2 ounces
or less of marijuana, you're not going
to go to jail. Legalization is very
different. Legalization, much like
alcohol, right? I mean, the federal I
mean the state government will say,
"We'll tax it. You can buy it and sell
it." My bill is not addressing
legalization. It's only talking about
decriminalization. So that way um
those who have a need for personal use
less than 2 ounces they will be able to
enjoy themselves
um smoking marijuana.
>> How many states have something similar
to that?
>> There are 24 states and so Georgia needs
to catch up, right? I mean, because when
you think about this, and I know my my
dear friend on the other side, Alis was
in law enforcement. Um, by
decriminalizing
marijuana now, we won't be tying up law
enforcement three or four hours to fill
out paperwork because somebody have an
ounce of of of marijuana. And that, you
know, in Georgia last year, 7,500
Georgians were arrested for having
marijuana for less than an ounce. with
my bill that goes away. It's simply like
getting a a a traffic ticket. You you
get a traffic citation, you have to pay
your $100 and you're on your way and and
that's done.
>> Okay. What do you think about it?
>> Well, it's just hearing about it.
>> Yeah, I just heard about it. That's a
it's it's obviously something that um I
I don't know that at first uh glance it
would be something I would I would
>> uh be a big supporter of.
>> Um I I do think that there is a
conversation to be had around that. It
is being used quite a bit, but there's
also been alternatives. Um even when I
was still policing, we had the option
because it was misdemeanor possession.
You could always issue a citation for
that and not have to make them post a
bond. So, you've always been able to
issue a citation for that.
>> Um, and there was a lot of officers that
used their discretion as to whether or
not it warranted them needing to make an
arrest. So, um, I do think there are
some still some perils that can come
from the the recreational use of
marijuana that can lead to other
stronger drugs. So, um, you know, I I
don't know that I would be in favor of
that.
>> Well, it sounds like it's worth the
conversation. Well, absolutely because
and I appreciate the the the the
discretion piece because three to four
times more often black men and women end
up going to jail because of
subjectivity. My bill would take that
subjectivity out. And so we do not want
our law enforcement profiling uh those
who actually need it. As a retired
military officer, some may need
marijuana because they're dealing with
PTSD. they don't want uh something as
harsh as opioids. And so there are a lot
of good health benefits um from this
particular plant. And so by
decriminalizing, we would not only
standardize this across Georgia, all 536
cities, all 159 counties, because you
have counties and cities right now that
are decriminalizing this. This is a a
bold step the state that could take and
say, "We're gonna decriminalize this
across all of Georgia."
>> Okay. Like I said, we'll continue the
conversation. Uh, Chairman Crowe, you
led the disaster mitigation and
resilience study committee in 2024. So,
bring us up to date on what's happening.
>> Yeah, so several of the recommendations
that we had from the committee, um,
we've already seen uh the fruits of some
of those. Uh, one of the recommendations
was to um move Georgia onto the next gen
or next generation 911 system. We've
made a lot of headway towards that. the
governor uh in last year's budget put
some funding towards it. Uh we had a 911
uh fee study committee in this offseason
that was chaired by uh um
a chairman um from the north side of
Atlanta. Yeah. He's going to kill me
because I can't think of his name right
now. It's terrible. Um but that
committee we looked at the the funding
mechanism for the 911 fee um and how we
could take that and utilize that to
implement nextgen 911. There was also
some timber uh tax credits for South
Georgia that got implemented last year.
And we're still working on adding a
resilience officer uh possibly within
GEMA to really focus on uh disaster
mitigation and resilience to try to
increase funding for that and to
increase our focus on that. You know, we
did that study committee during the
season when we were having um the
hurricanes coming. The timing was
everything. Yeah.
>> Yeah. The the timing was um was was
really um you know critical that we were
having that.
>> But just these last two weekends, we've
had winter storms. Yeah. And so, uh,
>> and then when when the power goes out
and you don't have access to that 911
system, you really think about it.
>> You do. Yeah.
>> It was Chairman Chuck Martin that chair
the 911.
>> Okay. So, you got that in. I'm so glad.
>> Chuck won't be mad at me. You did a
fantastic job.
>> All right. Switching gears again. Today,
Representative Jackson, on the on the
floor of the House, you recognized the
55th anniversary of the Thiacol chemical
fire near Savannah, and it killed 29
people. Yeah.
>> Talk about that. A lot of us didn't know
about it.
>> Yeah. So, this unfortunate tragedy took
place right here in Georgia um February
3rd, 1971, 55 years ago. And 29 uh of
these black women um uh died. And this
this plant uh was a plant where um a
significant number of majority of of
black men and women worked. Um it gave
them opportunity to uh earn a a living
and um and this plant was also uh
helping our military during Vietnam.
Well, in the curing room,
the the flare that they were
manufacturing sparked and it created a
chain reaction and it devastated uh the
plant and unfortunately these 29 women
that we recognized on the floor today.
Uh not only to commemorate them, but to
let the families that were also came
from Savannah and the coastline to let
them know that we did not forget and we
have to more to do.
>> I know you I'm so glad you recognize
them. I want to get into something real
quick and we don't have a lot of time. I
wanted to get your opinion on what's
going on with ICE. I know there are some
bills and you have one. What what do you
think should uh should there's be some
things happening in in Georgia when it
comes to ICE?
>> Well, there's obviously a lot of
conversation. Um the majority of those
bills have been assigned to the
committee that I chair. Um
>> and we've got a lot of committee uh
hearing requests for those and and we'll
be sitting down and having some
discussions with the sponsors of those
bills. Um, I'm having a meeting in the
next day or two with our legislative
council for the committee because
honestly, uh, we need to see what what
role we can take as far as overseeing a
federal law enforcement agency. Um, and
and what, you know, we can do legally to
even do that. Uh, what I will say though
is that um, we've had a lot of
conversations around ICE. I think that
that what ICE does, the job that they do
is critical. I think we need men and
women to do that job. I think that we
need to make sure that our borders are
enforced and that people who are here
illegally uh do not remain. And so it's
critical we have them uh and we support
them. And with all of our law
enforcement, whether it's local, state,
or federal, uh I think the majority,
vast majority of officers that work in
those uh departments are good men and
women who are trying to keep our
community safe.
>> Okay. Representative Jackson, you have
one of the bills that may end up
pending.
>> I do. I do because I think the use of
ICE in Georgia is a misuse. Um uh they
causing all this fear and and disharmony
in Georgia. Uh last time I checked,
Georgia's borders Florida, Alabama,
South Carolina, and North Carolina and
Tennessee. And so we we we don't need
our bord our borders are safe. Um having
ICE here in Georgia is a misplace of use
of the federal government. and and and
when you start to use uh anything that
looks like the military and citizens are
being intimidated and or ending up dead,
that's a that's a I that's a problem for
me. And so my bill is simply going to
hold ICE accountable because if they're
going to do something in Georgia, we do
have a right, we have sovereignty in
accordance with our const constitution
to do something about it.
>> Okay. Well, we're going to keep up with
all of this and we may have to have you
back on to talk about it.
>> All right.
