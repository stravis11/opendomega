Please join me in welcoming Bishop Mosley. Good morning to the President, Sonja Harpin, to all of you who make up this Senate and those who are here as guests. I want to share with you text from Matthew 14 verses 28 to 30. Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, come, when Peter was coming down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boy stress, he was afraid in beginning to sink. He cried saying, Lord, save me. I use this passage this morning to encourage you to stay focused in the storm. Here in Georgia we are familiar with storms. In fact, recently we had a snowstorm. We even had the experience of a hurricane in 2024, September. There's the forecast for the weather to be stormy this weekend. However, storms are not restricted to weather systems. That is, we do have and we encounter experience and go through storms in our lives. Life storms are things like illness. I'm personally going through the storm with the passing of my brother, just this past Saturday. Life storms include divorces, financial crisis, stress, unfounded criticism. It's easy to become distracted in enduring a storm. Your attention and focus can be pulled causing us to be less effective in stable when we need it the most. So I want to encourage you to remain focused in the storm. Our text focuses this morning on the disciples who have obeyed Jesus. Obedience does not keep us out of the storm. Jesus told them, go get in the boat. Go ahead of me to the other side. Jesus sends the multitude away, goes into a mountain and pray, but the disciples find themselves in a severe and destructive storm. They're in the middle of the sea. The boat is being tossed by the waves. The winds are contrary, not working with them to get them to their destination, but opposing antagonistic hostile. There are times that we meet forces that are working against our progress in this harsh and unpleasant environment. In the darkest hour they see a figure coming towards them walking on the sea in the storm. The Bible says they were trouble. But Jesus brings calmness to them. He brings calmness to their storm. First of all, saying to them, be of good cheer, it is I, in other words, have confidence. Have assurance because my presence is with you. If we focus on His presence, being with us, we can make it through any storm. Peter asked, and he's granted permission to get out of the boat, walk on the water, to go to Jesus. Peter does well as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus. My brothers, my sisters, you will do well in whatever your calling is. Whatever your responsibilities are, you will do well as long as you keep your eyes on Jesus. I close with this. I know your assignment becomes challenging. I know your assignment becomes difficult, trying, stressful, demanding, taxing and tough. Again, I encourage you to keep your eyes on Jesus. He will strengthen you. He will help you. He will lift you. He will empower you. He will bring you through. He will sustain you. And like Peter, he will rescue you. My five minutes are up. I will have to pray for you in my private. Oh, I'll be giving extra time. Wow. I must have done all right. Let us pray. Lord, we all have storms. We all face storms. We even have storms we don't talk about. We have individual storms. We have family storms. We have storms that we are facing together as a state as a nation. Help us in the storm. Bring us through and bring us out of the storm. Most of all, help us to keep our eyes on you. Staying focused on you. We pray with your word with devotional time. And as the Psalmist declares, I will lift up my eyes unto the heels from which commit my help. Even in the storm, my help. Come it from the Lord, which may heaven and earth. Bless these men and women as they serve in spite of their storms. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We've got a good group up in the balcony here and behind me, um, lineman from all over the state here today. So secretary, read the caption. Senator resolution 253 by senator Kennedy, the 18th and others resolution recognizing March 11, 2025 is Georgia lineman day and for other purposes. The Georgia lineman continue to be instrumental in maintaining the state electrical infrastructure responding to emergencies. Now, therefore, be resolved by the members of this body, recognize March 11, 2025 is Georgia lineman day to honor and celebrate the exceptional efforts of Georgia lineman past and present and their ongoing commitment to public service and protection of our state's residents. Miss resident, that completes the order. The next is their injection to the adoption of resolution chair here is none and the resolution is adopted. Recognize the program to speak to the resolution senator from the 18th. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning. It's great to see you all. It's a special day for us to get to recognize some special people. I like many of y'all the day after Hurricane Helene hit was riding down to the area that was so devastated. I was headed down to Adrian, Georgia, my little hometown riding down I-16 and the trucks were headed down there already to go take care of the folks that have been so hit and hurt by the storm. I'd ride by the trucks and I'd kind of look up and get their attention and give them a quick salute and a thank you and many times they'd respond and I knew these guys were heading in. Not to the eye of the storm but the eye-

of the trouble and the pain of Georgians who were being affected and had been so severely affected and across my mind, you know, we're so grateful the day of the storm and the days after when they show up to take care of us, but we kind of forget about them after that because once the storm goes and the electricity is back on and your services are back on, things are back to normal. But the truth is, we needed to have a lineman's day and that's where the idea came from and I'm glad you're here to celebrate lineman's day at the Capitol. You know, these guys and ladies really are the backbone of our energy infrastructure. They braid the storms, the flooding, dangerous temperature, long nights to ensure that our homes are lit, that we're kept safe and warm in those most darkest of hours. You know, most recently, as I said, we saw this first hand in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene with all that came and the damage that was left in its wake. You know, these guys and ladies don't seek recognition either during the time or after, but they absolutely deserve it. So let's let today be a reminder of the critical role that they play in powering our state and the sacrifices that they make, the personal sacrifices that they make to leave their families to come take care of us and make sure that we as Georgians stay strong and resilient. You've got some great folks on the on the roster with us. James Adam is a training and safety specialist with electric cities of Georgia. James spent 14 straight days in the field to ensure that power was restored. Charlie Purcell is up here with us, utility director for the city of Douglas. He's a lineman at heart and Charlie led his team through 29 grueling days, 29 grueling days of nonstop work ensuring the city's recovery. 29th up here with us with all of Mahal EMC. He worked 15 hour days, folks restoring power. His own family remained without electricity for 15 days while he was out taking care of the rest of us. Derek Hodge, a crew leader and a lineman with 17 years of experience was working from 46,000 votes to up to 500,000 votes across this state. Josh Pace is with us. He's a crew leader in Smurna distribution area with 10 years of service. Josh plays a critical role in powering major customers from Dovon's Air Force base to truest part. And Whalen Hastie started his career with Georgia power at age 18 that eventually led him to create the elite lineman training institute in 2019, which is instrumental in reshaping and shaping and teaching the next generation of lineman that elite taking care of us, our children and our grandchildren. In addition to the six folks on the roster with us, we've got a gallery full of folks. I want to ask all of you that are here for lineman's day to please stand. Let us give you a great Senate thank you and a welcome for what you've done for us. Thank you for that. Listen, I ask if any of these guys wanted to say anything and just like they take care of us, they come, they do the job, they don't want the recognition and they go home after we have been taking care of by them. So thank you for the recognition and helping us recognize these men and women who take care of us in the darkest of times. And with that, Mr. President, you'll be brought to you. Thank you. We have some very special guests from the Shepherd Center here in Atlanta and we have some great guests here. Good morning. Well, today we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Shepherd Center, a place of hope and healing that has transformed countless lives. Before I begin, let me first acknowledge those on the roster with me, including members of the Shepherd family. Jamie Shepherd, CEO, Alana Shepherd, the visionary founder, Julie Shepherd, founding family member, Sarah Bats, executive director of the Center Foundation and Clark Dean, board member and chair elect. Founded in 1975, this institution began as a six-bed unit in Atlanta, born from the personal journey of the Shepherd family. When Jamie Shepherd sustained a spinal cord injury in 1973, his parents confronted the scarcity of specialized rehabilitation in the southeast. Their determination led to the creation of a facility dedicated to comprehensive care for spinal cord injuries and related conditions. After their visionary leadership, the Shepherd Center has evolved into a world-renowned 152 bed hospital, annually serving over 700 inpatients and 7,000 outpatients. Its patient and family-centered approach not only addresses physical rehabilitation, but also empowers individuals to envision and embrace fulfilling futures beyond their injuries. The Center's commitment to excellence has earned it a place among the nation's top rehabilitation hospitals. Its pioneering research and specialized programs have set new standards in the treatment of spinal cord and brain injuries, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain. As we reflect on the five decades of service, we honor the unwavering commitment of Alana Shepherd, who at 94 continues to inspire and lead. Her relentless advocacy has not only shaped the Shepherd Center, but has also profoundly impacted the broader landscape of disability rights and rehabilitation. This Center stands as a testament to the power of compassion, innovation and community. It appears to 50 years of unparalleled service into the enduring legacy of the Shepherd Center. I will now introduce you to Jamie Shepherd. Thank you, Senator Halperin. Appreciate that introduction. On behalf of our 1,800 employees, I just want to say thank you for this recognition. We're honored to be here. We've accomplished a lot in the first 50 years going from, as you heard, a six-bed facility least space in another facility to the nation's premier hospital treating brain injuries, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions. As excited as we are about the first 50, we're even more excited about the next 50. We've got a campus expansion going on and we're going to be able to help even more people in the near future. So thank you for this recognition and here's to the next 50 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a very special guest here today, the family of Jeremy LeBlanc. He was a young man that was cut down way too short out of Roswell, Georgia, law enforcement, officer out of Roswell. We have his family here with us today and I want to recognize the senator from the 56 to recognize the family and speak to resolution that he has prepared for them. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, the Senate and all those that are in attendance today were joined by the wife, parents, family members, colleagues of Roswell, police officer, Jeremy LeBlanc. Some of them were behind me and some were in the gallery today. This young man, 24 years young, made the last measure of devotion for our community and he will be forever remembered. Joined with us as well as Roswell, Mayor Kurt Wilson, police chief Jim Conroy is one of the officers and the gallery and behind me as well as many of our finest here at the state. Working alongside the senator from the 14th and the senator from the 21st and all of you unanimously passed the resolution that will rename Georgia 400 and Holcomb Bridge Road as the officer, Jeremy LeBlanc, interchange. One of the busiest, not just in Georgia but in the southeast, that will forever remember his life and his legacy. I'm honored to present a flag that has been flown over the Georgia State Capitol to his family today. On behalf of a grateful state, I'm going to ask everyone to please rise for everyone who has ever served as a first responder or in the military. Please join me in saluting this family. God bless you. Thank you. We are excited to have one of our own Georgia grown and proud Georgia Bulldogs, University of Georgia grad and now newly Super Bowl champion here with us today. Mr. Nolan Smith who gave us a lot of excitement at his days at UGA and we made us very proud up there in Philadelphia playing for the Eagles right now which seems like his UGA part too with all the Georgia guys up there. But we are glad to have him and Secretary, read the resolution please. Senator Resolution 239, Senator Malo, the second and others resolution honoring the inspiring journey and achievements of Nolan Smith and all Smith and Junior and other purposes. Whereas Nolan Smith and Junior born January 18th, 2001 in Savannah, Georgia, shown the world what it means to dream big, work relentlessly and rise above every challenge of specific greatness. Or as Nolan's college career, the University of Georgia helped the Bulldogs secure back-to-back college football play off national championships. Whereas Nolan's dream of playing in the NFL became a reality when he was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 2023 NFL draft. Whereas beyond the field, Nolan has such countless lives. There is dedication to inspiring and mentoring others particularly through the Nolan Smith Foundation. Now therefore, be resolved by the Senate. The members of this body honor Nolan sent Nolan Smith for his extraordinary accomplishments, heart for service and unwavering commitment to others as well as wish him continued success in fulfillment and all of his endeavors, Ms. President of the Police, the Order. These are objections to adoption of the resolution, Chair Here's None, and the resolution is adopted. Collin, our Senator from Savannah, Georgia, Senator from the Second, speak to the resolution. Senator? Thank you, Ms. President. This morning colleagues, I rise to honor Grace Vannian and Nolan Smith, Super Bowl Champion, two-time dog, UGA Champion here. And it's exciting that he stopped by our chamber today to be recognized on the floor of this body for his accomplishments in Georgia and what he does. His foundation is very active in Savannah. He does great work for our community, so he's not someone that has risen to fame and forgotten about the hometown and the community he grew up in. And so I'm just honored to have him with us today. And also, Mr. President, I do have a resolution from Governor Kim, a commendation for Nolan Smith. He cannot be here today, but he did send a commendation. I always want to acknowledge Governor Kim, and I appreciate this body and the support of my colleagues. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. First of all, I just wanted to thank God. I wouldn't be here without him. I wouldn't be here without his blessings. I wouldn't be here without his glory. Second of all, I just wanted to thank the state of Georgia for this amazing honor. Truly, truly it is. And as a kid growing up in Savannah, Georgia, I would never think I'd make it to the Capitol. And I just wanted to tell you all, thank you all. And the last thank you I'm going to give is to my mom. My mom does a lot for me. She does everything. And I just wanted to thank her for allowing me to be here. And she's always got my back even right now, even in the Capitol. And most definitely, thank you to Mr. Burns, Mr. Richards. For helping my foundation, becoming what it is, and just allowing me from Savannah to come up here to Atlanta, meet some great people, shake the right hands, and do the right thing. And most definitely, lastly, go dogs. All right, we've got a number of more special guests here today. We've got to play full today. So Secretary, read the caption, please. Central Resolution 193 by Senator Jones of the 10th and others. Resolution recognized in commending, Troy Taylor and for other purposes. Whereas in 2009, despite by his global travels, he founded Zucat Gallery in Atlanta's Castle Berry Hill neighborhood, transforming a dirt floor commercial space into a contemporary fine arts gallery. And whereas Troy Taylor partnered with the Henderson Brothers in 2012 to re-brand Zucat Gallery with a primary focus on the works of living African-American artists. And whereas Zucat Gallery in the sense growing into the largest African-American fine arts gallery in the South of the Eastern United States, now therefore be resolved by the Senate and members of this party, recognizing commending, Troy Taylor, founder of Zucat Gallery for his many outstanding contributions on behalf of the arts, as well as extend best wishes for continued success. Mr. President, I can please the order. Raise your objections to adoption of the resolution, Chair Here's None, and the resolution is adopted. I recognize the Senator from the 10th to speak to the resolution to introduce our special guest. Thank you, Mr. President. And I'm glad to be joined by the Senator from the 39th. I am excited to share with you some of my really good friends who's doing something incredible in our great state. First, let me say that we are joined by the owners of Zucat Gallery, which is the largest African-American own gallery in the South Eastern part of the United States. I am joined behind me is Troy Taylor, Omari Henderson, and Anajey Henderson, these three men, or are the founders of Zucat Gallery, which is right here in downtown Atlanta, over near to Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Our friends are Miss Anastasia Clark, Vernon Taylor, Jordan Taylor, and Bob McNale, who's joined them as well. Just let me share a few words with you about my good friend Troy Taylor, and the many things that he and the Henderson's have done. After earning his BS in MS degree in aerospace engineering from Penn State and the University of Pennsylvania, Troy began his profession in the career as an engineer working with NASA on the man space program. Don't ask me how he went from NASA to owning an art gallery. I'm sure he will tell us. His interest in art, I have a begun doing the sophomore year when he landed a summer job with Bruce McGow, graphics that had fine art posts to repair clerk. As his career in corporate America grew, so did his passion for collecting art. His current work in the healthcare industry takes him all over the world from Europe and Asia, Japan, Latin America, India, and even the Middle East on a regular basis. And most of the gallery collections with the addition of multicultural American art and pieces by local Atlanta artists stem from the relationship that he has developed with artists and galleries throughout the world. The striking high-tech design and amenities of the gallery combine their dual interests in art and engineering. Thank you, Troy. He believes that art and science are similar in that like science, art is not random. There's an order in each discipline, rules of composition and technique that creates a beautiful, balanced product. Please allow me to introduce to you my friend Troy Taylor, one of the founding members.

of Zucott Gallery for a few words. Thank you, Senator Jones. And thank you to the co-sponsors and the Georgia State Senate for this honor of this resolution. Like all things you never get there by yourself. There's an all-saying no man's in Ireland or no persons in Ireland. And certainly I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the work, the rep for friendship, and the education of my partners, Onajai Henderson and O'Mari Henderson, who are really the driving force behind the success of the gallery. I also would like to recognize the artists who, through their incredible capabilities, are able to encapsulate moments in time, history, things that are important to us, on a piece of canvas or in a sculpture such that that piece can be collected and brought to the future for people to know what our generation or what our story is all about. I also like to recognize my life partner, Anastasia Clark, who's stuck with me through the good times and the challenging times. I also like to recognize Julia Kilby, who's not here, who got me into the art business. And also I'd like to recognize Devin Taylor and Jordan Taylor, my daughters, who are the co-founders and CEOs of the Troy Taylor fan club. At Zuka Gallery, we believe in two principal things. One is what you hang on your walls is a representation of you. It's a window into your beliefs, your convictions, the things that you find important. And so, as a gallery, we help individuals curate and explain who they are, what they're about, through the types of artwork they put on their walls at their office, their homes, and into their businesses. The second thing that we are very proud about is that as an art collector, you become somewhat of a custodian of culture. Because these iconic pieces that are created by these magnificent artists represent a society or a culture that has been documented over time. I know my partner is going to get me on this one, but for example, we didn't know that, or part of how we knew that the ancient cavemen used to eat deer and antelope, the first artist painted it on the walls of the cave. So that's how we know today that that's what they did. And so, as an art collector, you have the awesome responsibility of being a custodian of culture and being able to communicate to the future, the things that are important to us. There's always a narrative and a story behind each piece, and I welcome all of you and the folks of the state of Georgia to come visit us, see the artwork, and have an experience with collecting art and becoming a part of the culture. Thank you. you Are there any unanimous concerns? Does any senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? I recognize senator from the 28th. Senator, you can come down to the center aisle if it makes it easier for you. Thank you. Thank you. Let me move this out the way. Good morning. Senator, thank you very much, Mr. President. We have today is our county marshals day at the Capitol. And we have our marshals all from different counties that are here. Heart County, Raven County, Cherokee County, the Capitol County, and Fulton County, just to name a few. And the leaders are standing right here. I don't know if this is right. Where's Mayor Tom Reed? We have Councilwoman Ruby Foster. I think this is that I have a mixed up. But anyway, they're here. Let's give them a hand. Thank you. And our marshals are up there. Can you stand please? They let you in. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Today we come together to honor and express our gratitude to the county marshals and deputy marshals of the state of Georgia. These brave men and women serve with honor, dedication, and courage, ensuring that our communities remain safe and just. We thank you so much for your service. The office of marshals in Georgia has deep historical rules dating back to before our state's independence. In fact, marshals were the highest law enforcement officers in Georgia before the establishment of the office of sheriff. And I'm sure I submitted it from the 56 knows this very well. And this tradition highlights their integral role in maintaining law and order in our state. And their legacy continues today. Today's county marshals and deputy marshals continue to be vital in the law enforcement community.

The official code of Georgia annotated to environmental protection division, environmental advisory council, duties of council and its members and director. Appeal procedures generally permit applications and inspections.

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Dear colleagues, I bring in House Bill 287. It's simply a department bill, changing it from year 24 to year 25. The DNR has done a few improvements. One is that we made it where the youth, that young people that is under the age of 16 can go hunting and also turkey hunting in the spring. If they under 16, they don't have to pay for a license. Also, the Shell Fish Industry, we made it to where it's just more simpler on getting their permits. But listen to the Senate. One thing that the DNR has done, and I want you to go home and think about all your people back home in your district. But DNR has purchased, right at 20 wheelchairs, that's on tracks. So any person that's paralyzed in the state of Georgia does not have to have, does not have to buy a hunting of fishing license. And also anyone that's outside of the state can also get hunting and fishing license for free. Just ask you to vote for this bill. It's a great bill for the great people of state of Georgia. And also let's get out of here so we can go trout fishing this afternoon at two o'clock. Any questions? Any man? Any man? Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure?
