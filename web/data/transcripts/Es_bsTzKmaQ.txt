----------
There of convening having arrived, all members of the House will please report to their seats.
All members of this House will please report to their assigned seats.
The clerk will ring the bell.
All members, please take their seats.
We're going on to the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted, have all members voted, if so the clerk will lock the
machines. Well good morning or good afternoon, thereby feeling rested and energetic.
Okay. Well, good news is we probably won't keep you long today. But we had a great day yesterday.
But doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Chair wants to make mention.
Before we begin that today is the 76th anniversary of the creation of the Georgia
Port's authority by this General Assembly, fastest-growing port on the East Coast.
Really proud of those folks down there in the job they're doing.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the gentleman from the 33rd House District
Representative Rob Leveritt. Representative Leveritt.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, or good afternoon. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
the House. It's good to be with you again. It seems like we were here just a couple of
hours ago. I'm pleased to introduce you today, Pastor Timothy Adams. You know, Tim, I
was so pleased that Tim came up here because I was worried it was going to be difficult
for me to find a pastor who would be willing to acknowledge and public that I was one of
his parishioners. So I appreciate Tim for that. He and I, I suppose you could
say, we've got a lot in common. He has a great love of scripture and I have a
great need for them. Tim became the teaching pastor at the gathering at the
first Baptist Church of Elberton in August of 2020. He's from Elbert County,
grew up in a town, aptly named Dewey Rose. That's a good trivia question if you
need that. Previously he had served as the senior pastor of Deep Creek Baptist Church, which
is in Dewey Rose in Elbert County for 21 years. He's a 2008 graduate of level college at
the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, where he received a BS degree in pastoral
ministry and biblical studies. He's currently working on an MA degree in professional counseling
at Truett McColle University. Tim's been married to Patricia Haynes Adams for 26 years
and they have a daughter Rachel and a son Will. Tim and Patricia currently reside in
Calvert, Georgia, which is also in the district. So please join me in welcoming past rhymes today.
I thank my representative, Mr. Rob Leveritt, whom we are very proud of back in District 33 for
this opportunity. Rob and his wife, Ms. Mary, are true blessings in our community and I believe
that all of you will see his value as he serves us here in Atlanta. I also want to thank
Speaker Austin for extending this invitation to me today. I want to read from Romans 5,
therefore since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through Jesus. We have
also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand and we boast in the
the hope of the glory of God.
And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions
because we know that affliction produces endurance.
Endurance produces character and character produces hope.
This hope will not disappoint us
because God's love has been poured out in our hearts
through the Holy Spirit,
for while we were still helpless
at the right time Christ died for us.
Millions of people all over the world
and around this country and in our great state of Georgia
are currently observing the season of Lent,
which encompasses 40 days beginning with Ash Wednesday
and culminating with the celebration of hope
on Easter Sunday.
When I was in seminary, our professors always told us
to look for repeated words in the text
to determine the main points of the passage.
The word hope is repeated three times
in the six verses that I read.
The word hope in the Bible is much different from the way we use hope in the English language.
There's a great deal of uncertainty in the way I use hope.
For instance, each spring I say, I hope this is the year for my brave to once again win
the World Series.
Or each fall we bulldog fans say of our beloved dogs, I hope this is our year.
We hope, but we certainly don't know if either one of those things will happen.
But hope is described in the Bible as an anchor for the soul.
Hope is what keeps us from drifting too far away in the storms of life.
Our world is in desperate need of hope today.
We are almost to the one year anniversary of Governor Kemp declaring a public health
state of emergency order in the state of Georgia because of COVID-19. We have
lost so many good people in our state and because of the pandemic, just this
morning I received the news that one of my favorite people, Mr. Charles Moon, a
native son of Elbert County, and a veteran of the Vietnam War and Bronstar
recipient, passed away earlier today with complications from COVID-19. Many
Many people in our state are hurting economically, emotionally, and educationally as the pandemic
seems to drag on.
Thank God there is now a vaccine, and it is being administered rapidly.
But other people and families are dealing with the unintended consequences of the pandemic,
as abuse and addictions are getting worse.
Many of our citizens have lost hope that the things can get better anytime soon.
life can seem unfair and life certainly is hard. As one of my former teachers said,
life can be like a dirt sandwich and every day is a new bite. I have experienced
hopelessness firsthand as I have dealt with depression in my own life which
resulted in unintended consequences for me and the people that I love. But I am
thankful to have come through to the other side and now I can see hope because
Although I was down and out, I was not forsaken.
Through the love and care of my wife, Petria,
and other people who surrounded me and loved me,
I can stand before this house today healed and full of hope.
Preachers and politicians are similar
in that we both serve at the pleasure of the people.
And sometimes they have to vote us out
to remind us of that.
But we also have a unique opportunity in life
Because we are both in a position to offer hope to those who are struggling.
For those of you who have the pleasure to serve the people in the Georgia house, you can
offer hope by extending a hand up to those who are struggling for whatever reason, or you
can level the playing field to ensure all Georgians have equal opportunity to compete fairly.
As God has helped us, we must also help others.
I end with the words of the Apostle Paul from the message,
those of us who are strong and able in the faith
need to step in and lend a hand to those who falter
and not just do what is most convenient for us.
Strength is for service, not status.
Each one of us needs to look after the good
of the people around us, asking ourselves,
how can I help?
And with that, I ask you to please stand with me.
Let us pray.
Lord, we thank You for this beautiful day
that You have given to us.
Lord, we thank You for the Georgia House.
And Lord, as I stand here, Lord,
it's so easy for us to become cynical today
about politics.
But Lord, I've just been in awe
as I have walked around the Capitol.
And Lord, I'm in awe as I have met people, Lord,
who are doing good work here for good reasons.
And so Lord, I pray your blessings upon them today.
And Lord, I pray, God, that as they deliberate
that you would give them wisdom,
that you would give them clarity,
and that you would give them courtesy
in your holy name we pray.
Please join me in the saying of the pledge of allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.
Thank you.

We're going on now to, we're going on now to morning orders, afternoon orders, I guess.
Afternoon orders.
This house will come to order and give attention to the members and the will whenever y'all
already. Chair recognizes the majority caucus whip representative Kelly for
him afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house in the early
hours of the morning, the Polk County community lost one of our finest. With
the passing of Sergeant Barry Henderson of the Pope County Sheriff's Department.
Sergeant Henderson served our community for a number of years and always went out of his
way to give back to our community and took a lot of pride at his job.
He passed away about 130 last night after an extended illness with COVID with his wife
Chrissy by side.
I'll ask you to remember his wife Chrissy and our community and all his family at the
the sheriff's department as they mourn his loss,
and I ask for a moment of silence.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Tyler Paul Smith
and Chairman Jay Collins for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I come here today with a heavy heart
and my hometown of Bremen, we lost a man that truly gave
his all back to his hometown.
We lost Mr. Randall Redding last evening, I know,
as a builder, he probably built a facility
in just about every area of this state
and many of your districts.
He brought our little old hometown,
it's first state championship by winning
a state championship wrestling title
and just a great man.
He'll be truly missed.
I'll ask that your member, his wife, Miss Redden,
his children and his grandchildren,
as they grieve as he has went to be with the Heavenly Father,
if you'll join me in a moment of silence.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Mitchell
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I wanted to take a minute to highlight an ongoing mental health crisis.
Many of you here will have interacted with the veterinary in this year.
They're often taking appointments curbside to keep you and themselves safe.
And what you don't know is they're working even longer hours this year than ever.
There was no break for COVID.
The veterinary community has been rocked with losses due to suicide in the past several
weeks.
We see a friend change their social media profile to include the letters N-O-M-B.
It means not one more vet, and it's usually because they've learned of another colleague
who is no longer with us.
While this is an exhortation, to remember to be kind to your veterinary staff because
they're literally dying to try to help us in our animals, it is also a call to action.
We need to be normalizing mental health assistance, a discussion across all professions.
We need to be asking if our colleagues are okay, and we need to make sure that everyone
has a national suicide prevention hotline in their phone number, in their phone, which
is 1-800-273-TALK. We can't address problems that we don't talk about, and we need everyone
to be aware that veterinarians are not just caretakers for our pets and lives stock, but
loved and caring people in our communities who are in need of our support. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
Chair recognizes Chairman Belton for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The American Red Cross plays a vital humanitarian effort in Georgia, empowering millions of
our citizens to make a difference in donations of time, money, blood, to ease, human suffering.
Last year, Georgia's Red Cross safely adapted to COVID and brought emergency assistance
to 14,000 people in Georgia, including 3,000 local disasters.
The Red Cross helped save lives of Georgia every day, collecting 180,000 blood donations
this year to Georgia's 85 hospitals.
Red Cross provides only worldwide communications link
between service members and their loved ones.
Last year, Georgia Red Cross helped 29,000 military families
in Georgia with emergency messages, financial assistance,
councils, referrals.
It's therefore fitting that we recognize that March
is the Red Cross month and celebrate the volunteers
who collected 400,000 hours of their time that's here,
including our own gym tutor.
Do you remember Jim Tudor who used to make us or grilled?
She's sandwiches of Newton County.
If you want to see an example of American goodness,
goodness of Americans, look at Jim Tudor
and people of the American Red Cross.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
That completes morning orders.
And guess what?
