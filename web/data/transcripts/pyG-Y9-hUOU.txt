So on the fourth column is a member who just was sworn in today, a new member of this family from House District 125 represented Gary Richardson, Gary Richardson. Let's give him a round of applause. Athena. Representative Richardson was sworn in this morning by former member of this house. Judge Barry Fleming, it was good to see him today so it was a good morning. The representative of the office was good to see you name up on the board and thank you for all of your hard work. We look forward to working with you. Good luck. Doorkypus view please close the doors and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the lady from the 93rd House District Representative Doreen Carter, who celebrated her birthday yesterday.

I won't say which one it was, but she celebrated her birth. They represented Carter. Good morning. It's the first time I've been up here. Like the view. Thank you, Speaker Burns, for the opportunity. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to have the privilege of bringing Reverend Dr. Daryl Hall, Pastor of the Way Community Church, to be our chaplain today, and he is my pastor. We have with us a few of our board members. If you would greet them, we have Miss Tina Ulmer, Miss Jackie Floyd, and Mrs. Sam McClendon, who is in the gallery. You know, it's not often that you really led to a place where you know where the Lord is, and I am honored and privileged to be a member of the Way, where our pastor is being led by the Spirit of God, to teach people to life the way to life with Jesus. He's married. He has three sons. They're probably at school, or they would have been here with us today, which would have been a great privilege. But I'm not going to take ten minutes to introduce him, but I want you guys to know that he's a native at Atlanta, born and bred in Elizabeth Baptist Church, and now is leading the Way Community Church, Falcon's Band, but more than anything, he is a child of the most high god, and he walks it out every day. So ladies and gentlemen, please, I present my pastor, the Reverend Dr. Daryl Hall. Good morning, everyone. It is my delight to be here today, and I want to start by thanking Mr. Speaker for his hospitality and leadership of this great people, and for his warmth, his wife, towards me today. I also want to express my gratitude to Representative Dory Encarta, who is an esteemed member of our church, and I'm thankful for her love and for her compassion to me. As a native born at Lenton and a lifelong resident of the state of Georgia, it is an honor for me to be able to spend a few minutes with you all today to encourage you and to address you. Particularly to the representatives in the room whose work impacts my daily life, and whose work impacts the lives of the people I hold dearest. There's a passage of scripture I want to read in your hearing, Proverbs 16, verse 3. It says, commit your works to the Lord, and your plans will be established. A few minutes ago, Mr. Speaker asked us to acknowledge our presence by turning our names green on the screen to my right until you're left. And as I looked at the screen, I noticed those of you who checked in for your Office of Service and Duty today. But I want to impress upon you that there is a name who was present among us whose light did not turn green on the screen. But whose seat sits high above every seat in this room, and whatever we do, we ought to do so under the understanding that God Almighty is always present where we are. To that end, I hope that you can consider that your responsibility and the honor you have and the wisdom you use to execute your duty should be held in tension and light of the presence of God. In other words, I want to encourage you to hold your responsibility in tension with reverence. Hold the honor you have in tension with humility and hold the wisdom you use in tension with wonder. With all of the work you do, all the decisions you make never lose your wonder for the presence of God. With all of the honor you have for those constituents who have voted to allow you to occupy this place, I want to encourage you to do so walk in humility as you do so. And then with the heavy responsibility on your shoulder for your district, for the people who have placed our faith and confidence in you, may you execute that responsibility and reverence for God. Because every time we are in this room, God is here with us. And if we look close enough, we'll see God in us and in our neighbor. To the person in this room who struggles to see God in you, I say to you what Rafiki said to Semba when he struggled to see Mufasa's presence in his reflection, I say to you, look harder. And you'll see God in you, but God is also in your neighbor. There's a story of a little boy who told his mom that he wanted to go meet God. And so he asked his mom to make him a lunch and she obliged. He packed his little backpack and he began to make his walk from Newton County towards Atlanta to go meet God. And while he was walking in from Newton, his legs got tired around Rockdale. And so he sat down there next to a pond and began to partake of the lunch that his mom had made. While he was sitting there, an older man came and set beside him. He noticed that the older man didn't have anything to eat or drink, so he gave him his extra juice box and split his PB&J with him. They didn't talk much because they didn't need to. The view was so serene and beautiful and the moment was so peaceful, they just kind of soaked it in. Well, the day started to draw to a close and the little boy decided to go back home. When he went home, he walked in the house with a smile on his face. And his mom asked him, why are you smiling? He said, his mom, I'm smaller because today I'm a God. And guess what? He's older than you think. The old man went home with a smile on his face and when he got in the door, his wife noticed the joy on his countenance and asked him the reason for it. He said, babe, you know what? Today, I think I met God. And guess what? He's younger than you think. The point is, strangers were able to see the presence of God in the face of a neighbor. So regardless of what party you represent or what district has sent you to this place, my hope is that you see God in yourself when you look harder and across the aisle, you see God in the face of your neighbor. Would you please stand so we can pray. Let's pray together. Father, we thank you for this solemn moment to punctuate the sacred responsibility that these leaders have to represent me and other Georgians who have placed our confidence in them. We thank you God for our speaker. We pray God that you will continue to lead him and guide him. And I pray, Lord, God, for each of these representatives, God that you would encourage your heart, that you would allow them with a spirit of reverence and humility and wonder to execute the duties and trusted to them. And I pray God that you would guide them as they guide us. We commit our works to you, Lord, because we know only you can truly establish them. It's in your son's name, we pray that every heart say, amen. At this time, if we could please together pledge allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you, Brother Darrell. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Brother Darrell. We appreciate that the great devotion is good as we've heard here. So thank you for those words and thank you for encouraging us. Doorkeeping, we shall may unlock the doors, members, you may join Brother Darrell in the south any room. Show him your appreciation for his words and his presence with us today. And maybe take a photo if you'd like as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day today has brought us by a representative sharing Cooper of the 40th Dr. Brett Cannon. So if you need of good health services, you'll see Dr. Cannon down in the aid station. Thank you, pressure thanks for him serving. Thank you. Thank you, members.

So we have a lot of folks in the gallery who have traveled here to be recognized by members a day. So you need to take less than one minute, considerably less than one minute to make that recognition or I may just have to not allow some of y'all to have a morning order. So recognize your neighbor this morning as you come to the well. So I'm going to, we'll begin. I'm going to try to get all of you in, but it's up to y'all. Representative Barnes, you're recognized for a morning order. Representative, if you will, stand down just for a minute. Representative Dickie, you and representative Meeks are next. We want to stay on course here. Representative, Marty Barnes is recognized for a morning order. Come on. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I stand before you today to honor someone very special that we have up in the gallery. But first, let me tell you how hard it is for us to engage our youth today. Decades ago, when we were young, I'm a little older than I looked. We went outside and played and rode bikes and stayed outside to the lights. But it's hard to engage our youth today. So we have someone in the gallery that has found a way to engage hundreds and hundreds of girls in our state. I would like to honor Dr. Diana Williams, who has a dancing team called DD4L Dancing Dolls. And we have hundreds of girls who practice vigorously every day who compete and who still keep their grades up. So can we have Dr. Diana Williams stand up and the Dancing Dolls? Thank you. If you're a Dancing Doll, please stand up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Dr. Ben Dickies, recognize from morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues. And good morning. It's a peachy day today in the house. I know many of you asked me about the weather over the last few days. And I can assure you the weather was kind and our peach crop looks good. And today, it gives me pleasure to do so you to the 2023 Georgia Peach Queens. And they're in the gallery. These beautiful and talented girls have promoted Georgia's best fruit. Our peaches. Georgia is course of peach state and all year long they've done that. And they're wonderful ambassadors for not only peaches, but for Georgia agriculture and their hometowns. Let me introduce them to you real quick, Miss Kelly and off. She's a student from Winder at the Intending University of Georgia. There she is. She's done that for several years. I have Miss Teen Gabriel Brown from McDonough, Junior Miss Peach, Belgrade Sanders from Forsype and Lil Miss Peach, Brianna Blan from Clayston, Georgia. And Tiny Miss Peach, Ellison Boggs from Albany. So thank you all. Thank you Donna Long from Warner Robbins who's heads this pageant up and has done that for so long. Thank you Donna. Thank you girls for being here all you do. Have a peachy day. Thank you Mr. Peach. Welcome ladies. Thank you for representing the greatest product, one of the greatest products we produce in Georgia. Georgia peaches. Kevin Meets. Recognize for him more in order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You know, this body does a lot for education in our state and I have the privilege today to recognize Midway Elementary School in Pierce County as being a 2023 national ESEA distinguished school. Mr. Speaker as you probably know with this award coming through, one of the things that has to happen is there are only two schools in the state that are awarded this prestigious award. They have increased their scores on ELA assessment from 70.23 in 2021 to 89, 87.94 in 2023. But Mr. Speaker, they also increased in math from 84.88 to 95.83. Mr. Speaker and that would be on first through third grades. And as you know, these kids were in elementary school during a pandemic. So kudos to Dr. Todd and your staff for great work in continuing to educate tomorrow's leaders. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You're the well. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Great work.

But it is our speaker John Burns. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You're the well. For you excuse me. Representative Moville you're a pretty good soccer, a pretty good kickball player too. So thanks and congratulations. Thanks Mr. Leader. Representative Lisa Campbell is recognized for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues.

Today I rise to recognize the Cowie DeKon of Sheriff's Office. In 1948, Sheriff Lamar Pots showed the state of Georgia and the country that no man was above the law. This case was written about by Margaret Ann Barnes in the book Murder in Cowie DeKon and if you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you need to watch it again. V. Trin Andy Griffin and Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash is a wonderful piece of cinema about this event. Sheriff Lynn Wood continues the tradition started by Lamar Pots of Excellence years ago by hosting man tracker public safety training event. This event has been going on for over 30 years. County Cowie DeKon, they train over a thousand public safety officers from all over the southeast and the only event like this of its kind that I'm aware of. This kicks off on April the 18th and like all good things in Georgia, it ends with a big old barbecue and on behalf of Sheriff Lynn Wood, I want to invite each and every one of y'all to that barbecue dinner just come get with me. But today I have Captain J Wood on the command staff of the uniform patrol division and my brother Dan Jenkins and investigator in the Capitol crimes unit in the Cowie DeKon Sheriff's Department office. Again, thank you and joining me and welcoming these folks today with us. Thank you, General, for being here and taking care of the folks as well. Y'all have a very, very important job and we appreciate you. Chair Lady Penny Hauston has recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to welcome the very in-canny ambassadors from the chamber here to the Capitol, but they were, I see the chaperone here, but I think the students are over at the Senate and they were here first and I'd like the administration for the school and all the chaperones to stand up. Thank you all so much and I just want to say I was sorry I was not here when they were in the balcony, but representative Debbie Buckner, representative Evans and representative

Katie Dempsey and Scott Holcomb to support Katie and Scott on their mission and our mission to make the Senate recognize the bills we passed to compensate people in prison. And that's the reason we had a press conference and I hope they look to do it. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate your work. And I hope they listen to you too because we listen to you over here. Maybe we can pass out along to them. That completes our morning orders. Thank you members. We got through that pretty well and recognize some very, very important Georgians. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 328? Senate Bill 328 by Senator Albers, 56 in Robertson, 29th to be entitled to amend Title 47. The official go to Georgia and attend to relating retirement and pensions. Georgia provides many of the provisions of the peace officers annuity and benefit fund. This bill ever fund this bill ever signed the committee on retirement. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Clint Crowe is recognized to present the bill. Representative Crowe. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise that they present Senate Bill 328. And what it does is it makes some changes to the peace officers annuity and benefit fund or POAB. These changes, following in three broad categories, some administrative updates, improved benefits for members and a membership's dues increase. These changes are solely funded by the membership dues increase and there's no requested state funds or fee increases of any kind in this bill that would be a burden on the state. Administrative changes include providing a more concise definition for a peace officer that's in line with the post definition. It doesn't change any eligibility to be a member of the fund. It also includes updating job titles and duties, board powers and duties and the application process. The bill proposes several enhancements to the benefit of members. The five-year wait period for BIBAX is removed. So a member can buy back eligible time the day that they join the fund. And this allows, it's more financially feasible for officers to be able to buy back that time because they buy back at the actual actual cost of that time with the benefits included. So that's a big enhancement and makes it a lot better for the officers to be able to do that. Another reason to allow BIBAX is that approximately 80% of the officers are from city and county agencies. They often don't become aware of POAB until years after they join are eligible to join. And this requires agencies to provide information to new officers about POAB. And that coupled with a buy back provides officers a more realistic opportunity to purchase eligible time. To help with the shortage of officers in retention, institutional knowledge, proposed bill will allow members to have vested in the fund and reach the age of 55 to remain employed in public safety and receive their benefits from POAB. We're going to increase the death benefits for a regular natural death that will be $5,000. Line of duty death benefits will increase to $10,000. And another change is a refund of 100% of all dues paid to any person who opts out of membership in the fund. So hopefully this is another way we can support officers in the state and promote retention of our seasoned officers. And I will answer any questions, Mr. Speaker, if there are any. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, you're the well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none of the committee's report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of Senate bill 328. The A's are 161. The nasor 0. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 533-533? Senate bill 533 by Senator Strickland of the 17th to be adopted. Act of men, Code Section 177-130. The fiscal year of the Georgia Anitani relating to proceedings upon plea of mental and competency to stand trial, so it's to provide for jail-based competency restoration programs. This bill now referred to the committee on judiciary non-civilized committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Tyler Paul Smith has recognized to present Senate bill 533-533. Representative Smith. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of this August, by the good morning. Well, everybody's good and caffeinated. I bring to you today Senate bill 533. This bill comes to us as a recommendation of the behavioral health reform and innovation commission, and specifically from the Forensics Work Group chaired by Judge Gosling over in Great Paul County. As many of you know, one of the main functions of the department is to provide inpatient treatment for individuals that's due to cater to incompetent to stand trial. We face challenges in our state and most of the country, considering a long list of these individuals waiting for a state hospital bed caused by severe workforce challenges experienced in state hospitals during COVID. As of last week, there are 630 individuals stuck in a jail waiting for a bed with an average wait time of 275 days. However, the state only has 641 forensic beds. Half of those are occupied by individuals with an average state of over nine years. Due to these challenges, we've seen great pilot programs that are jail-based restoration programs in particular to help with this backlog. These programs include therapeutic intervention skills to allow these individuals to learn how to de-escalate in violent situations, as well as medical administration or individual and or group therapy. Currently, there are pilot programs underway in Cobb and Chatham counties which have yielded positive results, such as accelerated processing time. I'll note that this house has added funding in the FY 2025 budget to expand the Cobb program in another 30-bed program in Dodge County over in representative Danny Mathes' district. This bill is just another effort in helping those with mental illness who are stuck in our jails to get the treatment that they need. I will note this bill would simply grant DBHDD that authority, as long as there is a mutual agreement between the state and the sheriff. If the sheriff does not want to enter into this program, they do not have to do so. With that, Ms. Speaker, that's the emphasis of the bill and I'll stand for a couple of questions. You have a couple of questions. Yes, sir. Representative Mary Margaret Oliver, do you have a lift? Does the gentleman yield? Did my friend yield? Thank you, sir, for helping bring this bill to the floor. This represents an enormous amount of very hard work by both sheriff and the judges to deal with the problem significantly clogging our system. We need this bill and I appreciate your effort. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your long efforts in trying to approach this subject and get those the help that they need. Gentlemen, yield? Yes, sir. Representative Silcox, shall he? Silcox in the back? Does the gentleman yield? Did my friend yield? Is it not true that there are more than 1,000 people awaiting evaluation to determine if they are competent enough to stand trial and that the average wait time for these restoration services at a mental health facility is over 275 days. That is so very true and I thank you for that question and pointing out that key fact that there is a desperate need for this. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing the bill. Thank you. Ms. Speaker, with that, I'll yield this well and ask this body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as you did the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair has done? The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members have voted for what purpose is ripped in a kind of glass. Parliamentary inquiry. State chain, Vary. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the largest mental health service provider in our state is Georgia Department of Corrections, but SB 533 will help us change that direction? I know the gentleman has studied that area and I appreciate his comment. Have all members now voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 533, the yeas are 159, the nays are 8. This bill, having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will ye read the caption of Senate Bill 493? Senate Bill 493. Senate Bill 493 by Senator Hatch, the 50th candidate, the 18th, go to the 51st and others, being titled Act to Man Article 2, Chapter 1, Title 42. The fiscal to Georgia, antenna relating the sexual offender risk review board, so is to provide for additional penalties for registered sexual offenders. This bill ever committed to the committee on juvenile. I'm sorry to, but you're just sharing on several that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Victor Anderson has recognized to present the bill. Representative Anderson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I apologize for our voice. I hope it holds out today so I can present this very important piece of legislation to you. Senate Bill 493 today addresses the fact that technology has outpaced Georgia's laws and regulations, particularly in the field of dealing with registered sex offenders. Currently, it is state law that the photography of minors by a registered sex offender without the permission of their parents is a misdemeanor of high and aggravated nature. What this bill does is it adds that if they're on the first offense, if there is a fine associated with that, the minimum fine is $1,500. If there is a second offense, it advances it to a felony with a mandatory sentence of one to 30 years and a fine of $5,000 to $100,000. We also require that no registered sex offender shall possess, owner, operate, and unmanned aircraft system, commonly referred to as a drone, with the intent to photograph, observe, follow, or contact any person without their consent. Or in a way that violates their reasonable expectation of privacy. This provision comes with a mandatory five to 10 year and a mandatory fine of $20,000 to $100,000. Section 2 of the bill, strengthens requirements for petition for release from registration requirements. It also requires registered offenders who are convicted in other jurisdictions that they have met the requirements and been released from their requirements in those jurisdictions before they can petition in Georgia. And then finally, Section 3, it allows that the courts can prohibit registered sexual offenders from possessing owning or operating unmanned aircraft systems, again, commonly known as drones. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I will stand for questions and ask for the body's favorable consideration. You have one question representing silcox and the back has a question. Does it, gentlemen, yield? I do. Is it not true that many drones on the market have high resolution cameras with significant zoom capabilities that would allow a predator to take 4K video footage from altitudes where the drone may not even be noticed? That is absolutely true. And again, as I opened up my comments earlier, technology has outpaced our laws. This is an attempt to get back to the point where we can protect our, the vulnerable and the victims from these people. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. Gentlemen, you have one more question. Yes, sir. One representative Reeves to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman from Habersham County, you have four questions. I will, from a friend. Isn't this true? This is one of many measures we have taken this session to keep pace of technology and also that this is in response to police department requests. The gentleman knows what he speaks and yes or I agree with that wholeheartedly. Colleagues, I ask for your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, is yield of the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair has done the previous question? Is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair has done the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? What's favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote? Yes. All those opposed will vote. No, in the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted, if all members almost voted, all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of Senate bill 493. The A's are 170 and A's are zero. This bill, having received a request, constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 464-464? Senate bill 464 by Senator Dixon, the 45th, the 54th, still the 48th and others, will be adopted and act to amend Article 17 to Chapter 2 and Title 20 of the fiscal code of George Anandtated relating to teachers and other school personnel, so to establish a school supplies for teachers program. This bill emphirds the committee on education that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The lady from Warner Robbins, Representative Banner, it is recognized to present the bill. Representative Banner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have Senate bill 464. This bill does a couple of things. It amends House Bill 538, the Georgia Early Literacy Act from last year by providing some changes to the number of screening assessment tools that will be used to assess our students. By May 2025, the Literacy Council and the Department of Education will narrow down the current list of screening assessment tools that schools may use. This will be a list of five screeners, one of which will be the universal reading screener that was mandated in House Bill 538. It also codifies the current teacher supplies stipend program, which has been in place since 2021 using gear funds. These funds are running out and we do not want this program to disappear because it's good for teachers. This legislation simply codifies the program, keeping it in the code subject to appropriations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I'd ask for the body's favorable consideration and if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. The lady has a question or two if she'll take them. Let's see. This gentleman knows something about literacy. Chairman Irwin, do you all right? Has a question. Chairman Irwin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? Yes. Is it not true that about a third of our third graders do not read on grade level? That is true. Yes. Follow-up question. Sure. Is it not true that you in this House has led way at trying to tackle the task of a third of our students are two thirds of our students not reading on grade level? Yes. I have tried very hard to get this started and I am so appreciative of this body support. One more follow-up question if I may. Does this bill also help out our teachers that put a lot of money into their classrooms for their students by providing assistance for those students to the teachers? Absolutely. Most teachers spend about three to four hundred dollars out of pocket every year in their classrooms and this stipend program helps them in a number of ways. Thank you. Thank you for this bill. Lady E.O. Will Park to your left has a question. Will Park? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I do. Is it not true that I appreciate both sections of this bill, both the Georgia Council on Literacy along with the school supplies for educators at? I'm sure you did. Is it not true that or would you be open to ensuring that the school supplies section is included or amended to be included in any sort of change when it comes to our QBE formula? I think that is a big conversation that we all need to be open to having at some point and I think it's going to be subject to what appropriations wants to do. In light of how important and do you use for final question? Is it not true that because this is not included as QBE that it is possible for this legislature not to fund this going forward and could fund other priorities such as legislation and the federal government. Legislation as passed in Senate Bill 233. Well, I guess it is possible but I can assure you that I for one will be pushing for this program in the coming years. Thank you very much. Lady E.O. Will Park has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. She yielded the will. Thank you for your work on literacy. You've done a great job and I appreciate you standing for this bill. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute that Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted. What purpose is representing the Lisa Campbell rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry, please. Is it not true that I will hardly support all of the work that this chamber has done and the literacy council to help our kids improve reading? Is it further not true that there is an ongoing opportunity for us to continue to allocate funds in our budget to cover the incremental costs of new reading curriculum? I think the lady knows of the commitment of this House to the students of this state. So thank you for the question. For the inquiry, excuse me. All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the past, the Senate bill 464 of the yeas are 169. The next one, this bill, haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Thank you. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 455? Senate bill 455 by Senate. Strickland, 17th, Karpatrick, 30th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 494. 148, you can go to Georgia, Ontario, relating to recovery of medical assistance from third party liable for sickness injury disease or disability. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chairman Hawkins is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Hawkins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Substitute to the Senate bill 455. There are two sections added to the original bill. Section 1 deals with the health care plan shall not impose a step therapy for prescription drug treating serious mental illness. That is in the insurance code 33. Section 2 places the definitions of the listed mental conditions and the mental assistance medical assistance code of 49. Then on Section 3, we're into the original part of 455. In its states that third party payer shall not refuse to pay for health care items or services solely on the basis that the third party payer had not previously authorized for such item or service. Also says that the insurer will respond to the Department of Community Health within 60 days upon inquiry of non-payment. That's the bill. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I will yield the well. The gentleman did a great job. He has no questions. Thank you, sir. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. I have all members voted for what purposes represent Newton-Rice? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, it isn't true that this bill is just one more step in what we're trying to do in Georgia to take care of mental health individuals suffering with mental health challenges. It's so precarious that changing them every time their employer insurance changes would just be devastating. And this is a great step forward. Isn't that true, Mr. Speaker? I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks because of what he does every day for a living. He understands the issue from top to bottom. All members now voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 455 that lays the yeas or 170 nays or two, the bill had received a requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate bill 465? Senate bill 465 will send a good minute of the eighth hatch of the 50th tillery, the 19th and others to be entitled an act to amend Article 155. The title 16 of the official go to Georgia annotator relating to homicide. So it's required for the felony offense of aggravated involuntary manslaughter of this bill. I've referred the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. You ready, Whitburt Chet? Whitburt Chet is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ready or not? I'm here. Does everybody feel that? Everybody feels that impending 40th day coming on? I can feel it. Certainly the energy is different in the building. So I'm going to pray for each and every one of you all in this room as well as myself. So this bill, I'm going to do, it's a very near and dear bill to my heart. And I'm going to read some words about the young man that this bill is named after. And then I'm going to go into the specifics of the bill. Just so everybody knows what the bill is about, it's a fentanyl bill and it's just...

Speaking to address, the problems we're having with the folks in the state of Georgia and across the United States overdosing on Fint and All. I don't think that's a secret. I think everyone in here knows that it is a problem and we're trying to find a way that we can get after that problem here. But first let me speak to Austin. Is my honor to bring before you a Senate Bill 465 for my good friend, Senator Russ Goodman, who we share a district in South Georgia, particularly Lowns County in Valdosta. The bill is named after Austin Walters. Austin is a constituent of ours. He was a very gifted young man and very kindhearted and great personality. Austin loved people and people loved Austin. His attestment to the fact that he was one of the top performing salespeople throughout the nation for AgPRO, nationwide John Deere dealership. Austin like so many of our friends, family and fellow Georgia and suffer from anxiety and depression. He sought to treat the issue he faced by buying Xanax and he bought Xanax off the street. Well, unfortunately, Austin bought Xanax that was laced with Fint and All and that was a fatal mistake, the cost of his life. Shortly after his death, his father, Gus, who's here with us in the chamber, Gus and Beth Walters over here is the father of Austin. Started contacting Senator Goodman to try and help alleviate the issue we have with this Fint and All pandemic. For many weeks and months, Gus emailed back and forth with Senator Goodman and for many weeks and months, there was a back and forth about what do we do? I'll just tell you folks, this situation, you know, it rings true for me because I have to go back and tell my son. It takes one time, Brody. One mistake, you make one mistake. You take one pill. Now you and I, here, we grew up and it was a different world, right? You know, we could make a mistake or two. But one time you buy a pill that you think to be a legitimate pill and I'm not condoning the fact that you should be buying these pills by any means, but one time you take a pill and you don't wake up. You go to sleep, you don't wake up. And for me, for me, that's something that I couldn't live with. So to the bill, Austin's parents have had a suffer of a great loss. And in my district in the last month, I've had three overdoses of fentanyl. And this is something we've got to address. Okay, I'm through that folks. What we've done here, what we've done here, is given a tool to our district attorneys and our judges to be able to go after people that are selling and manufacturing fentanyl and putting it in drug substances like opioid pills, Xanax, substances like cocaine, heroin. This bill, when it came over from the Senate, was a much broader bill. I worked tirelessly with my friends on both sides of the aisle to make sure this bill addresses the issue and it doesn't encapsulate or capture folks that are innocent. I say innocent users, but someone that doesn't know that fentanyl is in the drug. Somebody that manufactures the drug or sells the drug is, in my opinion, at a higher burden. They know or should have known that that drug could be laced with fentanyl. So what we've done with this bill is given prosecutors the opportunity to go after somebody and we've created aggravated and voluntary manslaughter for someone that manufactures or sells a drug that has fentanyl and we made it very specific to fentanyl. Currently under the current felony murder statute, the burden that the DA has to carry is to prove not only there was intent to kill but also intent or new knowledge that there was fentanyl in the specific chemical makeup, which is a burden that is almost incapable of being reached. So what drug dealers and manufacturers are saying they're going into court and they're saying, well, we just sold heroin. Why just sold Xanax? I just sold this. I didn't know fentanyl was in it. That, my friends, is not something that I'm willing to let them do, to continue to do. We took out delivery, we took out distribution so we don't capture somebody that is a user that is sitting next to somebody that they smoke a marijuana cigarette that is laced with fentanyl and they didn't know because they purchased the material and then one of the people that has smoked that marijuana cigarette dies with them and they are subject to this liability. We carved that out. That is not reached in this bill. This is intentional acts of manufacturing and selling any illegal substance that has fentanyl in it and if fentanyl was either part or in hold because of the death. What we've done here is a very carefully crafted piece of legislation folks that we can all support, that we can all get behind to try and curb this epidemic of fentanyl use in the state of Georgia. We've also added to this bill the provision that makes it illegal to have appeal press. I said I didn't even know was a thing. People were out there buying these presses to make fake Xanax and make fake percassettes because the dollar amount that they're getting on the streets is so significant. They produce something that's produced in a garage that somebody takes like Austin thinking it's legitimate pharmaceutical grade Xanax takes it and never wakes up again. We've got families all over the state that are suffering and I'm asking for your favorable consideration and I really appreciate everybody standing in honor of Austin and his mother and father. I really appreciate you all advocating for this bill and thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield for questions if there are any. Gentlemen has a couple of questions. Representative Moore to your left has a question. Representative Moore is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Maniel. Yes, ma'am. Is it true that 60% of the coroners here in the state of Georgia would agree that many of the deaths that come in from marijuana are laced with fentanyl? The lady knows of what she speaks. River St. Titania Miller has a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield to my friend I do? Is it not true, Mr. Whip, that we spent a significant amount of time working in a bipartisan way to make sure that this bill was narrowly tailored to get at the worst out here in an effort to combat what is one of the most deadly illicit substances that is currently flowing in our streets and in our communities? The lady knows of what she speaks and I do appreciate my colleague across the aisle working with me on this bill and also Representative Roberts. We very much appreciate your input and also the chairman of the committee from which the bill came representative or chairman Tyler Smith. I do appreciate your work on this and thank you very much. Thank you for your work. Representative Crow has a question. Representative Clint Crow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General, you're— General yields. Is it not true that in 2023 the DEAC is more than 79.5 million fentanyl laced fake pills and a 22 DEA study found that of all fentanyl laced fake prescription pills, six out of ten now contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl? Yes, sir. The gentleman knows of what she speaks. Representative Higgley to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Isn't it true that on behalf of one of my youngest constituents, Kayla Green, I want to thank you for this bill because she's dedicated her Girl Scout Gold badge to making fentanyl awareness her project. So thank you so much on her behalf. Thank you. Representative Cox, your right has a question. Mr. General, I'm yield. He does. Is it not true that just this past week, a 27-year-old past player of mine that I coach that graduated with my son was helping his father in Daytona Beach who had just had a stroke and went and got a Xanax that was laced with fentanyl? He was murdered and robbed and we lost a great individual whom I dearly love and my family dearly love. And if not for this bill, I believe that we would be giving less hope to people. So thank you for carrying this bill and we believe in you. Thank you, Representative. Well, I think many of us have stories from our districts. It is literally an epidemic that we've got to get a hold of. And what we do as lawmakers as make laws up here, and this is the redress we have to seek out and try and fix this issue. I really appreciate everybody's favorable vote here, but I do want to recognize Senator Russ Goodman, who's been integral in getting this bill moved through the Senate and really appreciate my friend from South Georgia. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to yield the will. And gentlemen, as you do the will, we have a couple of folks who would like to speak in favor of the bill. Representative David Clark. Representative Clark has recognized to speak to Senate Bill 465. Representative Clark. Sorry. I was going to come up and support Senate Bill 465. My cousin. Representative, you step away just for a moment. We'll recognize this House can recognize Youngman's parents who are with us as well. Our condolences to you all. Thank you all for your hard work. Help us move this important piece of legislation. Thank you. And thank you for being with us here today. Representative Clark. So I'd help that in when my cousin passed. A group of them, when I'm vacationing together, me and my brothers, I mean, he was a cousin, he was a brother to us. He died last June, June 28, 2023. He had struggled for a number of years with drug abuse. He had found his way. He went to Ted Hill College, gained a skill. He was crushing it in life. And he had one slip up and went to sleep, never woke up. And so I just want to come, as you're going to support this bill, hit right at home, all of us. And my uncle, it eats him up every single day. You know, we're so proud of him where he had come from. And he had just come promoted at his job. And he was an amazing musician. One of the best musicians I've seen on the guitar. I mean, just he would bring the whole room alive when he played and he sang and died at 33 last year. So just wanted to come up here, ask for your support of this bill and let's save lives. One life is one life too many. So thank you. Thank you, Representative Clark. Drill lady, seal cocks has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid is approximately 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Initially developed for medical use to manage severe pain. So listen to use has surged in recent years, particularly in the context of street drugs. What makes fentanyl particularly lethal is its potency. It only takes a tiny amount to make this substance a fatal overdose. And tragically many who consume illicit drugs have no idea that fentanyl has been mixed into substances they're actually using. The consequences of course are devastating. Families are shattered just like Austin's. Communities are left grieving. Lives are needlessly lost. The statistics are staggering, painting a grim picture of the scale of this crisis. We all know that deaths from fentanyl overdoses have been rising in alarming rate with no signs of slowing down. But behind all these numbers lie real people. People like Austin, sons, daughters, parents and friends who have fallen victim to this very deadly substance. The drug dealers that sell unsuspecting victims' drugs, laced with fentanyl, are playing a deadly game and should be held accountable for the damage they cause. This legislation will do just that. By enacting strict penalties for anyone complicit in fentanyl overdose, we send a strong message to all of Georgia that we will not tolerate poison on our streets and we will aggressively pursue anyone that pushes on unsuspecting victims. So I do ask for your favorable support for this very important measure. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The board of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is representing sharp arise? Pardon me, I'm inquiring. Stay tuned, Quarry. Is it not true that I've been in the medical field for over 30 years as a paramedic? And when we come to someone that has experienced this, it is very difficult for us to know that the fentanyl is there, even though they tell us it's maybe Xanax or another drug involved, but we really don't know that the fentanyl is involved, so it really makes it hard for us to revive that patient. And also, usually when we get to someone who's involved with fentanyl, there's a lot of time it's already too late when we get there. I know the gentleman knows what he speaks and we appreciate our first responders in this state. And you're certainly one of those. Appreciate the job you do. The purpose is representing Reese rise. Parliamentary angry. Stay tuned, Quarry. Is it true, Mr. Speaker, that fentanyl has had a very negative impact on our state? It does not discriminate based upon race, gender, age, or sexuality. It impacts all communities the same way in a negative way. It isn't it further true that today, with evidence of this vote, that this body is sending a strong message that those who perpetuate this drug and our community amongst our children, amongst our young folks that we are coming out to you and we will not tolerate it. Mr. other gentleman's vote will reflect that his opinion for what purpose does represent his stents and rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stay tuned, Quarry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that I've been a part of the Afunal industry for 17 years? And these past two years, I've seen mothers crying over the passing of their sons and daughters due to this drug that they end up taking without knowing what they were taking. And it left these families in a really hard position financially because they didn't have money to pay for their funerals. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. Thank you. And she sees a lot of these, I'm sure. What purpose is representative, main arise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stay tuned, Quarry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that we just had a house of young children to just walk through the door and the gallery and not only is this bill supporting Austin and his family, but just the mere fact that these children are hearing this discussion. This bill not only will save potentially their lives, other people's lives, and this is just a fantastic measure and thank you, since we're good for the bill. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? I'm sure the lady believes every word she spoke for what purpose is chairman Tyler Paul Smith, right? Parliamentary inquiry. Stay tuned, Quarry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that Georgia has a felony murder statute that holds criminals responsible for the deaths they may cause in the commission of other crimes and this legislation would help drug dealers to that same standard? I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks because of what he does here and what he does in his community. Now, have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 465. The yeas are 175, the nays are zero. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Thank you, Rick Chatton. Thank you, members. Members, we're going to break for lunch.
