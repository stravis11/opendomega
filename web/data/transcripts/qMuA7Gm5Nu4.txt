>> Well, thank you, Mr. speaker. Thank you
colleagues and uh happy Farm Bureau Day
and Georgia Forester day. So you get a
lot of agriculture today and that's what
our uh morning devotion is going to be
brought to you by a great friend of mine
from Crawford County uh Leighton Culie.
Um it is very fitting for Leighton and
his wife Brenda uh here today. Leighton
was born in Crawford County and raised
in Crawford County, my home county,
right down the road. As a fourth
generation farmer, he knew from an early
age that he wanted to be in agriculture.
But he left home, went off to Valdasta
State University where he played on a
couple of championship football teams as
center. uh came back to his farm with
his parents Leighton I mean Larry and
Terry Culie raising chickens, cattle,
hay along with three fine sons, Lawson,
Lane and Ledger. So um Leighton uh
background in agriculture goes way back.
He served for many years on a Crawford
County Farm Bureau board as president
and now represents the fifth district on
the Farm Bureau state state board and is
very active in that and all his and his
colleagues are uh down at the depot and
we will be up here shortly uh in the
halls of the Capitol. So, thank you
Leighton for your involvement that he's
also very involved in EMC Flint EMC
Electric Board. He followed me when I
was elected here and uh when my power
goes out that's who I call Leighton. So
um but Leighton felt God's call soon
after he came home from college began uh
the youth pastor at Roberto Evangelistic
Church. He served in this position until
the church called him to be lead pastor
in 2023.
I want to tell you one other interesting
fact about Leighton. He's a movie star.
Uh he and his wife Brenda were featured
in a documentary called Farmland and you
can find that on YouTube. It's a great
movie that they filmed of six young
farmers discussing their family uh farm,
their legacies and uh all it takes to be
uh farmers and uh it's a wonderful
documentary uh for agriculture. So uh
with that the multi- uh multi-talented
uh and multi uh just loves agriculture
and loves the Lord Leighton Culie. Thank
you.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Thank y'all very much. Mr. Robert, what
an introduction. I'm gonna have to get
you to start doing more of those for me.
The uh y'all, what a blessing to be here
today. Mr. Robert, thank you so much
just for asking me to be here. Um known
him a long time, my whole life. growing
up there in Crawford County. But u man,
just what an honor to be here to get
your day started or help you get your
day started if you will. And I just want
to thank each of you for allowing me to
be here this morning. Um see a lot of
familiar faces in the crowd and I just
see friends and I just thank you uh for
what it is that you do. But I just want
to take a few moments this morning just
as we get your day started just to share
a little bit. Um I want to start share a
little bit about me. Mr. Robert kind of
gave the the uh the 30,000 foot view.
But I was raised in the small town of
Roberta by two parents who loved my
sisters and I who love the Lord and who
deeply love one another. Uh growing up
in Roberta, I grew up on a chicken,
cattle, and hay farm where hard work and
sweat was and still are a daily
occurrence for us. As a kid, I fell in
love with farming and the rural way of
life. In high school, I fell in love
with government and the process in which
our American society operates. In
college, I fell in love with my wife,
Brenda. And as a young adult, I fell in
love with my savior, the Lord Jesus
Christ. Today, at 42 years old, I just
think about how each of these things
have really just led to to who I am and
and where I am today. And I I praise God
that that I've still not been able to
get over either of these infatuations in
my life. And I'm just thankful for it.
Y'all, like many of you, I have the
blessing of serving in several different
capacities. As Mr. Robert said, I get to
serve on different boards, but kind of
along my my journey, I I really used to
just ask the Lord, I'd say, just just
narrow down my scope. I really just want
to be really good at one thing. I just
like to be good at one thing and wear
one hat. And I just have realized, I
guess I've I've I've discerned that his
it's just not his will. But I've
determined that uh that in each one of
these situations, wearing whatever hat
it may be, I just want to be as good as
I possibly can in that moment and in
that presence. And that's just kind of
how I I try to walk that out. Brendon, I
have the blessing of raising our three
boys on our family farm in Roberta. We
farm for a living with mom and dad. And
um I serve farmers, as Mr. Robert said,
through Georgia Farm Bureau Federation.
And I'm absolutely blessed to serve as
pastor of Robera Evangelical Church.
Just a small church there in Roberto. We
got some folks that love and I love them
back. They love the Lord. I'm thankful
for them. But y'all, this morning I just
kind of want to share a word with you
from the book of Habacook. I don't know
how familiar that book is or or how
common you guys may hear something from
it, but just want to share a little bit
out of that. The prophet here is
recorded as laying out this strong
complaint to God just about how
difficult, how unfair, and how unjust
things are just in the world around him,
in his immediate surroundings. He's
looking around at how far uh things have
just gotten out of hand. And as he he
concludes this expression of disdain, he
follows it with this statement that's
found in chapter 2 verse one where he
says, "I will stand at my guard post and
station myself on the watchtowwer and
I'll keep watch to see what he will say
to me." Here's what the prophet was
saying right there. He says, "Lord, I'm
looking around. I'm looking around at
everything around me and I don't I don't
really understand what's going on when I
look outside of my windows or my walls.
I really don't even agree with what it
is maybe that you're allowing to take
place maybe amongst the people. However,
he says in the midst of this, I know
what it is that I'm supposed to do. I
know what it is that I'm supposed to do.
See, the prophet was declaring here that
he had a guard post. He said, "I have a
guard post. I am to be stationed on the
watchtowwer looking out standing guard
for the people. You see as a prophet it
was his responsibility to spiritually
stand guard and be the watchman for the
people. He was to hear from the Lord and
to look out for impending danger. In the
book of Ezekiel, it says that if the
watchmen sounded the alarm but the
people didn't respond, then the blood
was on their hands. However, if the
watchman were to see the threat but
failed to sound an alarm, then the blood
would be on the hand of the watchman.
What I'm trying to say is as a prophet,
what he did, it mattered. It really,
really mattered. And I think about me
and and a lot of you as a father, as a
parent, it's my responsibility to stand
guard for my family. Um, regardless of
what's going on around me, regardless of
where society or uh public opinion heads
to, I stand accountable to God to
declare that as for me, in my house,
we're going to serve the Lord. And see,
in my home, what I do really matters. It
matters, y'all. As legislators of this
great state, a place that I am so
incredibly thankful to have been born
and raised in, a place that I'm so
thankful to be raising my family in.
Y'all, as legislators, as leaders, as
influencers,
you stand guard in so many ways for men,
women, and children around our state.
You stand guard, y'all. This this sacred
chamber right here that as I walk in, I
just kind of sense that it's a special
place. This sacred chamber is your
watchtowwer.
What you do matters. I mean, what you
matter, what you do matters on a daily
basis. For those of us who are who are
outside of these walls, it matters so
much more than any of us could fully
understand. And I just want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart for what you
do for me and my family and other people
just like me around the state. What you
do for my industry and I promise you I
promise you that it it matters. It
really matters. I want to close with a
benediction and prayer found in the book
of Numbers. And I want you to kind of
hear these words as I as I share them.
and and maybe asked the question, Lord,
is all well with my soul? And I want you
to think about it in a way that of
course of course we want his blessings
and favor. That's what the benediction
is. Of course, we want his blessings and
favor. But the real question is, do we
seek his heart and his guidance? Do we
really seek his will for our lives and
for those around us? When we look at
Habac and what he was going through as a
prophet, when you start reading in that
book, the first chapter, you realize
that Habac really wants God to change
the world around him. He really wants
God to change the world around him. And
that's a noble venture. That's a noble
desire. But what he realized through
this is that God really wanted to do a
work inside of him. That he really just
wanted to change him for the better and
him for the good. I was thinking about
we we we've heard it said or we say it
often that you guys can't legislate
morality, right? You guys make laws, but
you can't legislate morality. But if
there's one thing I was thinking about
this morning that as you legislate,
you can do so through accountability to
the Lord, through the strength of Jesus
Christ, you can do so morally and
ethically. And I thank you for that. I
want to share these words over you this
morning found in Numbers chapter 6.
says, "May the Lord bless you and
protect you.
May the Lord smile on you and be
gracious to you. May the Lord show you
his favor and give you his peace."
That's my prayer for you today. It's my
prayer this morning. Let me ask you if
you will to stand. We'll open in prayer.
Father, in Jesus name, we thank you so
much, Lord, for who you are. Father,
you're good. You're merciful. You're
faithful. And we thank you for that,
Lord. We thank you for a hand of
protection. Lord, we thank you for a
hand of mercy. Lord, most of all, God,
we thank you for your grace of
salvation. Lord, we thank you for your
son, Jesus Christ. And Lord, this
morning, I thank you for these men and
women, Lord, who stand at their
watchtowwer. And Lord, they stand guard
for so many people. Lord, I thank you
for that. I thank you for their
willingness to serve. And Father, this
morning, Lord, we just pray over this
day, God. We pray for a good day. God,
we pray for a productive day. But Lord,
we pray for a day that our sights are
set on you. God, we love you. We thank
you and we praise you. It is in your
name we pray. Amen.

So, uh, if you can do that, that'd be

The minority leader of this house,
Representative Carolyn Hugley from
Columbus, Georgia, is recognized for a
morning order.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the House, today we honor
Rosa Parks,
not just as a civil rights icon, but as
a powerful reminder of what true courage
looks like. Rosa Park did not raise her
voice. She did not seek the spotlight.
She did not act out of anger or implus.
Instead, she demonstrated the kind of
courage that comes from quiet strength
and unshakable dignity.
On December the 1st, 1955, Rosa Parks
made a simple but profound decision
to remain seated.
In that moment, she showed the world
that leadership does not have to be loud
to be transformative.
Sometimes leadership is calm, resolute,
and grounded in selfrespect.
That quiet act sparked one of the most
significant movements in our nation's
history. Because of Rosa Parks,
thousands of AfricanAmerican citizens in
Montgomery, Alabama refused to ride the
city's segregated bus system for 382
days. Day after day, rain or shine, they
walked, they carpooled, and they
sacrificed not out of anger, but out of
collective resolve.
That sustained act of courage shook the
conscious of this nation and ultimately
led to the desegregation of public
transportation in Montgomery.
Rosa Parks taught us that courage is not
about volume. is about conviction.
She understood her worth, the power of
her humanity, and the ripple effect of
standing firm in what is right.
Her life reminds us that change often
begins with one quiet no that inspires
thousands of courageous yeses. You don't
have to be loud to be strong. You don't
have to seek attention to lead. And you
never know how one brave principled
stand can carry a people forward. Mr.
Speaker, thank you. I yield the well.
>> Thank you, Leader Hugley.
>> Representative Carter,
are you on the floor?
>> Chairman Blackman, you're on deck.
represent Dorene Carter is recognized

>> Good morning.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we have

Association, the Atlanta Chapter. They

know that I did attend Jackson State
University. I went there on a music
scholarship. I played trombone and
bassoon. Yep, those were the days. if
you would stand with us, please members
of the Jackson State University alumni,
and let's welcome them to the people's
house.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We hear the

Chairman Corbett is recognized for a
morning order. Chairman John Corbett
and friends represent Griffin, you're on

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have a

make sure we aware of the issue with
dyslexia and how early intervention is
critical. Uh and I've got a letter I'd
like to read from from somebody at the
Shrank School. It says, "Please keep
funding for dyslexia. I am a fourth
grade student at the Shrank School. I
want you to keep refunding because I
have trouble with reading and writing.
Since I went to shrank school, it has
been a lot easier. Dyslexics also have
advantages like extra time on tests.
Some famous dyslexics are Tom Cruz, Walt
Disney, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da
Vinci, John F. Kennedy, George
Washington, George W. Bush, Jim Carrey,
and Hen Henry Winkler. As you can see,
dyslexics are talented in lots of
different ways. Please keep please keep
helping all dyslexics. So I'm going to

dyslexia to please stand and let us
honor you today.

Representative Ford.
Representative Ford's recognized for a
morning order.
>> Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, speaker, and thank you,
members. Today I would like to welcome
members of Georgia Farm Bureau,
especially the members from my district
of Barry and Cook and Tiff counties. Um,
and my area of the state and my family
rely heavily on the cotton sector of
agriculture.
The cotton sector is one of our big
drivers. But in the last several years,
things have not been good with low
prices and low demand.
And let me tell you what the cost of
that is to consumers. Most people are
surprised to learn that majority of
clothing today is made from synthetic
materials, essentially forms of plastic.
Natural fibers such as cotton make up
only about 20% of the market. Synthetic
fibers have become so common place that
many of us rarely stop to consider what
our clothing is actually made of. And
this convenience comes at a hidden
hidden cost. Every time we wash or wear
synthetic garments, they shed tiny
invisible plastic particles known as
microlastics
into our environment. So, I encourage
you today and all days to wear cotton.
Thank you.
>> Georgia cotton. That's what I'm talking
about.
Thank you, ma'am.
Representative Griffin, you gonna bring
Representative Jackson with you? That's

resolution
recognizing February 10th, 2026 is
Georgia Farm Bureau Federation Day at
the state capital and for other
purposes.
Whereas the Georgia Farm Bureau
Federation was formed in 1937 as a voice
for production agriculture in the
legislative arena. And whereas from its
humble beginnings in Northwest Georgia,
the Georgia Farm Bureau Federation has
grown to 158 county chapters with a
current membership of over 235,000
led by volunteer farmer members. And
whereas this outstanding federation of
Georgia farmers has become diversified
organiz organization which focuses on
service to its members and the
improvement of Georgia agriculture. And
whereas the Georgia Farm Bureau
Federation now operates companies which
provide services to its members in areas
that include advocacy, insurance, and
banking. And whereas the House
Agriculture and Consumer Affairs
Committee has long recognized the
Georgia Farm Bureau Federation under the
dedicated leadership of its president,
Mr. Tom McCall, as an exemplary voice of
Georgia agriculture. And whereas it is
abundantly fitting and proper that the
Georgia Farm Bureau Federation and its
members be appropriately recognized for
the many years of dedicated service to
Georgia agriculture.
Now therefore, be it resolved by the
House of Representatives that the
members of this body recognize February
10th, 2026 as Georgia Farm Bureau

This bill I'm referred to committee on

recommends that this bill do pass.
>> Chairman Lauren McDonald is recognized

Representative McDonald.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, colleagues, uh this is that
utmost important bill that everybody
will be when you qualifying in March
that you can go to your constituents and
say you passed this bill. Uh this bill
is the one that set down from the
federal government that for our safe
operation of motor carriers, commercial
motor vehicles and drivers and safe
transportation of hazardous materials.
All we're doing here is changing the
date, the annual date from 2025 to 2026.
I know your board's lit up back there,
Mr. Speaker, but I'm going to go ahead
and yield the well.
>> You have a couple of questions.
The gentleman's not going to answer any
questions, so I guess I won't recognize.
He get them he can uh
you can do it in parliamentary inquiry.
Gentleman's yielded well. Is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered? Hearing none, the previous
question is ordered. Is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Hearing none, the
report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote
yes. All those opposed will vote no. And
Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
For what purpose does represent Meeks
rise?
>> Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
>> State your inquiry.
>> Mr. Speaker, is it not two that the
gentleman from the 26 last year authored
a bill that changed the name of MCCD to
another acronym which is not in this
bill? So, I'm not sure that it is fully
compliant uh with what he's intending to
do.
>> I'm not sure that's true, but I tell you
what, we're going to look into that
because of this uh something that's not
kosher here with MCD. We're going to
have to check on it over in the Senate.
I'm sure they'll be more than willing to
look into that issue.
All members voted.
All members voted this. So, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine?
Okay.
On the passage of House Bill 944, the
yays are a 162, the nays are four. The
bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed. And we'll look at that issue in
the Senate.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption
to House Bill 1015 10:15?
>> House Bill 10:15 by Representative
Workheiser the 157th to be entitled act
to amend article 10 of chapter 9 on
title 34 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to self-insurers
guaranteed trust fund regarding workers
compensation so as to provide certain
funded levels of such fund. This bill
been referred to the committee on
industry and labor. That committee
recommends that this bill do pass.
>> Chairman Warheiser is recognized to
present the bill.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Don't know how
he did it, but the only thing we could
find that was less interesting than
federal regulations and conveying
easements was workers comp.
So,
>> gentlemen will suspend. I'm sure there's
at least one person other than me wants
to hear this. So,
>> please give the gentleman the well your
attention. He deserves it. Gentleman
recognized or continue.
>> Thank you.
So, if you're a small business and you
have more than two employees, you
generally will get your workers comp
through an insurance agent.
large businesses because they get to
keep their money and earn interest on
it. They will pull their b money with
other businesses or if they're large
enough, they'll do it themselves, but
they will self-fund their workers comp
insurance
and they'll keep that in a stack of
money over here.
Over here
is a precaution in case there was a
catastroph catastrophic event. In case
the business were to go bankrupt or the
funds be depleted out of money, they
impose on themselves
an assessment to go into a fund that is
overseen by the self-insured guaranteed
trust fund which is overseen by the
state workers comp board.
That fund has a floor and a ceiling that
has not been updated in decades. And 15
million doesn't buy what it used to. So,
we're raising the floor from 5 million
to 10 million and raising the ceiling
from 15 million to 25 million. Once that
ceiling is met,
the employers no longer have to put
money into that fund, but it's just a
safety valve and it caught a
catastrophic event. And so that's what
the bill does. If there's no other
questions, I would ask for your favor.
>> Gentleman has a question.
>> Question. Okay.
>> Representative Lupton to your left
>> is recognized for question.
>> Thank you. Does the gentleman yield
>> reluctantly?
the the lady from the the gentle lady
from the 85th would like me to ask you
if we need to get out the fish. Is this
your first bill?
>> Hardly hardly my first bill, but first
first one this year.
>> Congratulations.
>> We haven't seen a vote yet.
So if he congratulates him then uh the
gentleman has no further questions.
>> Thank you. And I ask for your favorable
consideration. Thank you.
>> Gentleman's yielded. Well, is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered? Hearing none, the previous
question is ordered. Is there any
objection to agreeing to report of the
committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Hearing none, the
report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote
yes. All those opposed will vote no. And
Mr. Clerk will unlock the machine.
Have all members voted?
All members voted. If so,
Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On
the passage of House Bill 10:15, the
yays are a 165, the nays are a three.
The bill, this bill, having received the
requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed. Now we'll offer our
congratulations to the gentlemen.

>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And as I stand
here, I'm really trying to keep it
together because this was a very dear
friend of mine. Um, today I rise with a
full heart to honor the life and legacy
of Ron Shipman, a devoted husband,
father, and a leader whose steady hands
helped guide Georgia Power, the making
water authority, and the economic future
of Middle Georgia. And a man whose
presence reminded us that true
leadership is rooted in service to
people. Ron Shipman did not simply hold
titles. He built trust, strengthened
institutions, mentored future leaders,
and carried a vision that our
communities could grow stronger
together. Born in Videlia, Georgia, Ron
lived a life marked by curiosity,
passion, and a love for others. He had a
deep appreciation for aviation by and
biology and was someone who truly
enjoyed learning and exploring the world
around him. From his decades of
excellence at Georgia Power to his
historic leadership at making water
authority, he worked quietly but
powerfully to ensure that families,
businesses, and neighbors across our
state had opportunity, stability, and
hope. I'm going to yield to Rep.
preparing for the remainder.
>> But beyond every achievement, he was a
family man grounded by love, guided by
purpose, and remembered for the
compassion he extended to everyone he
met. Today, we honor not only what he
accomplished, but who he was. a
bridgeuer, a servant leader, and a proud
Georgian whose legacy will continue to
flow through the lives he touched in
every community that he served and
helped shape. I ask this house to join
me in celebrating his life, lifting up
Anita Shipman and the Shipman family in
our prayers and recognizing that Ron
Shipman's impact on this state will
endure for generations to come. If you
would please honor him with a moment of
silence.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the
well.
>> Thank you, members. very appropriate and
our condolences to the Shipman family.
Fine man he was. I'd met Ron. Good man.
Great work. Condolences to the family.
