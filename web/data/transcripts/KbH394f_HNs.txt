TRANSCRIPT
----------
In 1922, two years after the 19th
amendment passed, giving women the right
to vote, Georgia elected its first women
in the general assembly. Currently, 13
out of 56 state senators are women and
more than 60 out of the 180 members of
the House are female. These dynamic
women, they wield influence, and some of
them are in leadership positions.
Tonight, we'll hear from four women.
First, Republican Representative Beth
Camp of Concord. She chairs the
judiciary juvenile and her other
committees include ways and means and
agriculture and consumer affairs. Also
with us is Democratic representative Jay
Roberts of Atlanta. Among her committee
assignments are judicial, non-ivil,
governmental affairs and creative arts
and entertainment. Welcome to you both
to Lawmakers this year. So I'm going to
start with you um chairman camp. You
have a bill to provide state employees
who are biological women with hormone
replacement therapy. Why do you think
this legislation is needed?
>> Well, it codifies that the state healthc
care plan would provide
coverage for women needing HRT, hormone
replacement therapy. With the blackbox
label warning removed from hormone
replacement therapy, I think it's
important just to make sure that women
who are in the state healthcare plan,
which are a lot of women, um teachers
are included, state employees, a lot of
others, it gives actually an opportunity
for those women to make sure they have
what they need. As we age, our hormones
change and um we're not all built um to
be 25 forever and bone density and
muscle density and cognitive ability.
There's, you know, incontinence, there's
all kinds of things that are very
important for women's health that
hormone replacement have shown time and
time again to be helpful with.
>> And right now, state insurance doesn't
cover that.
>> Um it does not fully cover it. Okay. For
some aspects, yes, but not all aspects.
So, what would your bill do? Cover all
of it?
>> It would cover all of it. Yes.
>> Okay. All right. We'll talk about We
have You have more to talk about coming
up. Represent Roberts, you and five
other Democratic female lawmakers want
to gain once again um a big one.
Sweeping
a sweeping rewrite of the Georgia law on
abortion and reproductive health. This
is something you've fought for for for
years, uh every year since 2019 in the
heartbeat bill. So,
>> yes. Isn't it still an uphill battle?
What do you think?
>> It is an uphill battle, but I think it's
really important that we continue to
fight because um I just believe that
every Georgian should have the freedom
to decide when and if they want to have
a family. I mean, we are facing
affordability crisis right now and
forcing women to have children that
they're not ready for, can't afford is
just one more thing that we need to look
at. And then there's the whole health
crisis. you know, doctors and lawyers
have to confer at critical care times um
when women are in the middle of misaring
and um we've got bad health outcomes. We
know Amber Nicole Thurman, Adriana
Smith. Um, you know, these stories are
real and the people are re real here and
um so I'm I will continue to fight for
it because um you know I've told my own
abortion story publicly. Um I was
pregnant and and my baby was uh
incompatible with life. We wanted it.
Um, but I was able to make that choice
because my doctor and my parinatlogist
said you're 37 and it's hard on your
body and you have two little ones at
home and so um you know we recommend
that you terminate and my husband and I
had a hard decision to make but we did
and my daughters now 22 and 25 can't
make the same healthc care decisions I
can. It's time for us to put these
decisions back in the hands of women and
their doctors.
>> Okay. We I I know it's personal for you
and so thank you once again for sharing
this. We'll talk about more specifics in
a moment. Okay. I want to switch to a
hearing you had today on one of your
bills. Tell us about the bills. It bill
it deals with contraception.
>> Yes, it is actually a great bill um
because it gives accessibility to women
um so women can make some more choices
in their lives. Um for example um we
don't have we have 82 counties that do
not have OBGYNS in our state which is
astounding. So this bill allows
pharmacists to operate at the top of
their lure and prescribe contraception
including depa and so most individuals
in communities have there's a pharmacy
if there's not a doctor in town there's
generally a pharmacy um even box stores
havearmacies grocery stores havearmacies
so it's a wonderful opportunity for
people to have more access to that
health care um this bill also would
allow individuals to get more than just
a month at a time and their insurance or
Medicaid coverage
So they could get up to 12 months at a
time. So someone who's unbanked, someone
who's a gig worker, someone who um
doesn't have transportation. There are a
lot of opportunities for individuals to
be able to get contraception and have
that discussion with a health care
professional, a pharmacist.
>> Are there any other states that have
done the same thing where you bypass the
doctor essentially?
>> Well, it's not bypassing. Um
>> you still have to go to the doctor.
Well, they still recommend you have a
papsmear and get all the the checkups
that anyone else would normally get, but
um 36 other states have provisions that
allow pharmacists to prescribe
contraception. Um and there's things
that was one of the questions today.
There are medical reasons why a
pharmacist might not be able to. If you
have a family history of breast cancer
or ovarian cancer, if you have a history
of blood clots, if you're a smoker, um
if you know perhaps you don't have a
lifestyle that you might need to get
another form of birth control, maybe
you're not going to remember to take the
pill every day or something along those
lines, you need to talk to your
gynecologist to get um perhaps an IUD or
make other decisions about
contraception. So, a you'll have to give
your medical history to your pharmacist.
>> They probably already have it. My
pharmacist knows a lot about me. They
know every medication that I've taken
for the past 15 years and um they they
have a lot of information on me and I'm
sure yours does as well.
>> I I'll think about that. You may be
right.
>> Uh Representative Roberts, you your bill
would mean a legal shift in
investigating and prosecuting pregnancy
outcomes. So, how how would that work?
Well, it would take criminalization of
doctors and women out of the mix. So, um
doctors could go back to practicing the
standard of care that they um and follow
their oath. A lot of times they're
feeling like they're being asked to um
deny the standard of care that they were
trained to give their patients. And so
that's put them in really difficult
positions. I mean, there are hospitals
that have teams of people that meet to
discuss whether or not care can be
given. and we know women have died in
this state because of the lack of quick
care. Um, and so it's just really
important that we remove the prosecution
side of things. Um, we tend to be trying
to pro uh to criminalize a lot of our
professions these days. I was in lots of
hearings this week about librarians
trying to criminalize them. Um, so it
just seems like we could support them
and make sure that we're not as
legislators, we're not practicing
medicine without a license. I feel like
that's kind of what we've been doing a
little bit.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you.
>> Y
>> I want to ask you about your
contraceptive bill contraception bill.
Would it um
we you're going to follow other states,
but would you would you still need to to
have some doctors involved at some
point? Yes, the um state composite
medical board and also I'm sure the
department of public health would be
involved to some degree and um the
pharmacy board. They're all going to
come together and in other states they
set up a protocol of what questions are
to be asked and what facilitates a yes
and what facilitates you need to go see
your doctor. So, everyone is going to be
very deeply involved. There's going to
be um continuing education for the
pharmacist. Um, the Georgia Association
of OBGYNS came in today. They support
this bill
>> because I know you look shocked. They
support this bill because they going
back to there are 82 counties without an
OBGYn and out of 159, they can't get to
everyone they need to get to. And they
they deal with complex pregnancies. They
deal with other women's healthcare
needs. someone simply needing to be put
on the pill or to a patch that doesn't
always ne necessitate going to the
doctor and so they recognize this could
be a great partnership to make sure
women get the health care they need. Um
our licensing in our state our
pharmacists are doctors and so this
would allow them to operate at the top
of their lure.
>> Okay. So they're did you have any of
them talk about the bill today?
pharmacist or obedies pharmacist.
>> Um, no, but they are supportive of the
bill of the measure. Um, it's not a
mandate. All pharmacists do not have to
do this. So, if you're at home, you do
not have to do this if you're a
pharmacist.
>> That's what I was going to say.
>> But, um, but it does give them an
opportunity and I know talking to my
pharmacist um I'm able to get a lot of
information and um advice and so I would
feel comfortable doing it and I think a
lot of people would.
>> Okay. Well, we're going to keep up with
your bill and your bill too. I want to
thank you both for coming on the
