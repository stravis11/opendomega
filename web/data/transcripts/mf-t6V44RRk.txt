we're going to move right along quickly. So we'll be willing to hear anybody wants to ask for
for something. Just come round it up and let us hear from you, please.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I have HR 557,
which is the first sheet in middle ways through the page. And this wouldn't create a
study committee on Georgia's two investment funds to figure out what to do and not to do.
And the first step is obviously having a study committee. So that's HR 557.
Thank you, no questions. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
Chair Lee Haguey.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee. I have House Resolution 512. It is halfway down the first page of the blue sheet.
This would create the House Study Committee on Addiction, Epidemic, and Solutions for Recovery.
And we would look at all forms of addiction and there would be 13 members appointed by the speaker eight would be house members and the other five would be people who are impacted by addiction issues or who are working in the addiction treatment or in recovery community as well.
Thank you ma'am. Don't see any questions. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee, I'm here with SB 30 page 2, third from the bottom.
This has to do with Peary Blockers.
It was adjusted in the committee and I would ask you to move it and move it on out.
Thank you.
Okay.
Have a question for you with part.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Senator Watson, is it not true that there's overwhelming consensus from every major medical association that gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers from minors reduces suicide risk and improves long-term mental health such that your bill if it passes would likely result in a lot of pain, suffering, and possibly even death of Georgia's children?
Would you read that back to me again one more time?
Is it not? No, I got it. I'm sorry.
We thoroughly debated this and there's a disagreement opinion and I'll disagree with your premise and it's about it. Thank you.
Thank you, your lady Cooper.
Senator, is it not true that this was a different version than the first one that he might be thinking about and that this allows for the blockers to exist, but puts very careful restrictions around their use, which is what is recommended by the pediatric National Board and so forth?
It is a different bill than what was in the Senate, it came out of committee, and I would suggest that we move it and let the process work. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Don't see any other questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Havius.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have.
In a bill, 245, it's at the bottom of page four.
It's basically it's grandparents visitation bill
and what it does simply, it says that grandparents
who have previously been granted visitation rights
to a grandchild may modify those rights
or may ask the court to modify those rights
in the event of the death, the incapacity
the incarceration of a parent.
Okay.
Thank you, Senator Noxini.
Questions?
Thank you.
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On page one at the very bottom-center resolution,
resolution 231, offer.
Remembering our Fallen Officer in Roswell Interchange,
I know Chairman Jasper has done an excellent job
putting all the first responders and veterans together.
Thank you for his leadership.
On the next page page two half way down Senate bill 23 is an increase of the amount of alternative investments that can be used for both the ERS as well as a firefighter pension fund
And then Senate bill 27, which I mentioned yesterday is
Doxing which is basically online stocking. I want to thank Chairman Tyler Paul Smith for helping perfect this in the house
Okay, thank you sir. Don't see any questions. Thank you
Chairman Dickie
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, bring you H.R. 590.
Some 35 years ago, this legislature established a commission fee to help our visually and hearing
impaired citizens and technology has really outpaced what we're trying to do there and we
want to look at the possibility of reducing those fees or doing away with those fees and
those type things.
So that's what this bill does.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir. Senator Terry
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senate bill 21 it waves the local government immunity if the local governments are not following Georgia immigration law
Okay, have a question boy whip part has a question senator tillery
Help me understand the majority parties
Priorities here with respect to allowing people to sue cities
but not but trying to limit lawsuits against big corporations.
All right, now you can't see the city at all, right?
So we're opening it up in some shape for our fashion
if they're not following the laws that have already been passed by this body.
So you're making it easier to see cities
but harder to see corporations in this legislative session?
No, I don't think that's necessarily true.
If you're looking on the entire gamut of what we allow to be sued
then you're actually trying to open up and move cities
closer to where corporations already are.
so making it easier to see cities.
Making it easier to see cities
when they're not following the laws
that will pass by this chamber.
Okay, don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
