TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
You order and we are actually going into Senate Committee on
rules standing so if you look you've got SR334 in as the the agenda's here we've
got the resolution is in your folders our president pro-tim of the Senate who
I'm sure is on his way up has this little resolution simply we're changing
the rules to where you can't travel out of the country on the Senate's dime and you
can't travel on the Senate's dime and you're if you're leaving office is the gist of it.
See by Mr. President Pro Tem, we give us a little more detail on your Senate Resolution
334, working off at LC-280595.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mike, number eight.
This resolution is the product of the member out of state travel memo that was released
on March 1st, 2023, prior to my services protein, a study committee trip went to Europe.
And I think there was some press about that issue, a pump becoming aware of this, I've
worked with Lieutenant Governor's Office on what we think would be appropriate changes
to the Senate rules that would address issues of international travel and making sure that
certain protocols are being followed for the use of Senate funds for within the United
States travel.
And so that's what this resolution does.
really does three things, it amends rule 1-2.4 and prescribes it neither the president
of the Senate nor the members of the Senate shall engage in any tribal outside of the
U.S. at the expense of the Senate.
Number two, it amends rule 1-2.4 and the bill prescribes it neither the president of the
Senate nor any member of the Senate who is in their final six months of term of office
may travel outside the state of Georgia at the expense of the Senate.
And then finally, rule 1-3.2 provides that no Senate staff member shall engage in any
travel outside the U.S. at the expense of the Senate.
Those are the three main points that are made by the proposed changes to the Senate rules.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
You're ready for the motion, sir.
Oh, let's hang on.

I'm going to allow you something unsworn Declaration,
which is that the Declaration may not have been.
There we go.
Made under penalty of perjury, but without having
to be notarized, if it's signed outside of the United
States is requested by the Atlanta international arbitration society would be
of great help to them in promoting Atlanta as a hub for international
arbitrations and would be of use to other practitioners in civil cases.

Last year, we brought it back this year.
This does two things.
One, it requires that executors notify beneficiaries
just like they're currently required to notify ares.
And then investment accounts that have beneficiaries name
will not have to be subject to probate,
just like your CD, check an account, bank account, et cetera.

In my haste, Thursday, I explained that.
I left out some important information.
Earlier that day, I had took some errors
for the majority whip here in the Senate in the bill.
We had natural resources.
I stood in his place so he was able to get there,
to get some bills out of that committee
and later get it passed out of full committees
to help the number boards.
I left that out and I want to put that in.
So aren't any questions?
How's the author?
All right, you also got SB340.
That's right.
Go for it.
340 is a bill where we protect a planning period
for teachers, but at the same time,
we can still allow the principals
to be able to use them one day a week
or if they can save your reasons,
they can use them more than that.
All right.

We have 19 positions with nine medical examiners serving
over 11 million people.
This is a bill that was created in the House
and made better in the Senate.
And it's going to allow for these medical examiners
to recruit and retain and also be retroactive

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members
of the Rules Committee, House Bill 182,
section one of that arises from the State Bar
of Georgia's real property section
And Board of Governors, it fixed a commercial real estate
issue following a 11th Circuit court decision.
The rest of the bill is a follow-up
from the timeshare bill last year.
It leaves everything last year in place,
but gives some title insurance and mortgage protections
for larger timeshare companies.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Great job, any questions?
All right, thank you.
And I have the State Ethics Commission bill
can wait until later or address the number.
What's the number?
572.
go ahead and cover. Mr. Modi wanted to be here. He is in a meeting
couldn't come but 572 officially renames the State Ethics Commission, the
State Ethics Commission. No more tongue twisters. It also had some five or six
technical changes based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision and some other
things have come up over the year. So three very light technical issues and
request your consideration of House Bill 572. You got HB444 on here as
as well, and I presented that last week, the Liz Pendance Bill.
I'd be glad to talk about Liz Pendance more
or if the committee recalls it from last week.
Is there any questions about Liz Pendance?
I don't know her, but.
It, the Senate passed it last year.
We're trying to get to it earlier this year in the House
if you'll approve.
This is the Senate Bill last year.
Tell Liz she needs come see me.
We're gonna talk about this Bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
All right, Representative Barton.
So you back, there you are, HP 183.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is the Department of Revenue Bill.
This is a bill we got through rules last year in the Senate,
but it is to make it to the floor.
This bill based, the basis of it is where they want
to change it from a temporary license plate
to temporary operating permit, and they call them tops.
And it's just make it where the dealers get new and used,
and the tax commissioners are saying the same language,
That's the basics of the bill.
They call them what?
Tops.
Tipperary operating permit.
All right.
That's the basis of it.
It's creative.
Any questions for the author?
Thank you.
Did you have any more?
I didn't see any.
That's it.
This one.
All right.
Thank you.
Uh, Representative Sains.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Have House Bill 188 formally the dangerous sexual predator
prevention act now, mariums law, in a collaboration with a tragic accident that
happened here in Atlanta, it wouldn't ensure we respond to Park V State, which
didn't allow, in a loud GPS monitoring for some of the most dangerous
sexual predators, it would put a lifetime concurrent sentence to the 13 crimes if
you've been twice convicted of many of those 13 crimes to allow Department of
Community Supervision to then do a lifetime GPS monitoring, which was part of
Senate study committee who that looked over this bill this issue did you all study it we took
y'all's lead and ran with it took it as installed it collaborated
what's the public safety chairman have to say about this
I don't see any questions thank you thank you saying you did such a fine job of explaining it
All right, HB193, Representative Anderson.
Come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
HB193 raises a project cost threshold for compliance
with Georgia's local government public works law
from $100,000 to $250,000.
Any questions for the author?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Representative Lamston, you got $2.292.20,
to, I think you had another.
Yeah, 541, yes sir.
Let's do all three.
All right, House Bill 221 and 222
are both insurance department bills.
221 deals with rate filing for auto insurance.
This bill keeps the current file and use model
in place for the state mandated minimum filing
and adds a 60 day waiting period for all other filings.
This is a compromised bill
that all the affected parties have agreed to.
It provides adequate time for the department
to review the filings and provides a guarantee of speed
to market for the insurers.
That's the bill.
Okay.
Next.
House bill 222 is also an insurance department bill.
It addresses four sections of the insurance code
minor changes.
First section has language that makes it clear
that the insurance department only regulates service contracts
that are sold to individual consumers,
not to any other entity.
Second change deals with probationary insurance license
and extends the period of a probationary license
from 12 months to 24 months, third change deals
with re-application for insurance license
when the license application is denied,
lousy insurance commissioner latitude
to reinstate between one and five years.
And the fourth change removes a reference
to code section that no longer exists.
That's 222.
All right, 541.
And House Bill 541 is a bill that deals with uniform rules
with the uniform rules of the road,
much like we have done in the past
where a motor vehicle,
a police vehicle is on the shoulder of the road
with the lights flashing.
We require motors to slow down,
move over and pass at a reduced speed.
This simply includes in a similar code section
vehicles that are stranded on the shoulder of the road
with our lights flashing
or a postal service vehicle
that's running around moving in a non-traditional fashion.
Okay, any questions for any of those.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
All right, Representative DeLouche, 273.
You will hear this.
All right, Representative Franklin, HB 285.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Appreciate this.
So this is a retirement bill.
And it's a request from the employees,
retirement systems be able to raise their investments
no turn of investments from 5% to 10%.
Any questions for the author?
Thank you.
Thanks, sir.
Representative Cameron?
He was.
Here you are.
I thought I saw you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
8B327.
This bill makes one change to the state in Cessla
adding step grandchildren.
In this amenity from a case in a lookout mountain judicial
district where a case could not be prosecuted because
of this omission, step children
are in the state inside slough but step grandchildren or so that's so much
change. Okay. Any questions for the author?
They'll keep it down there trying to concentrate. Thank you.
Thank you sir. All right, Representative Drenner, HP 431.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. House Bill 431 strikes language in line 64 through
75, which are restrictions for the cab county, the cab county only existing
sploslaw and just removes those restrictions. Okay, any questions? See some puzzling
looks? What's your question? State your question. What restrictions would be
removed from the from the spost. The restriction of how you could spend the
spost dollars it just levels the plain field for the cab county only that's it.
Is it isn't the spost was approved by a voter referendum? It was yes. And the
conditions were included in that referendum. There'd be a new referendum. So you
would have to get the voters to approve of the changes in this legislation. Yes.
Okay, thank you.
Any other questions?
Sir Hostel number number three this really just makes the cab like the other counties. They were in a different deal
It makes them exactly like every other county
All right, thank you. Thank you
Representative Ballinger
HP 508
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, HP 508 just basically starts us shot clock
that says that temporary protective orders or temporary restraining orders, DROs, should
be served within 24 hours, happy to answer any questions.
Any questions?
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is representing Ridley with us.
I hadn't seen him born poor land, hurting.
Oh, that Ridley.
Different Ridley.
Come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Bill 524, it just clarifies language
on three-wheeled vehicles.
And it says any vehicle that has a frame
to partially or fully enclose their operator
and has a seat belt is in a motorcycle.
It's a car, so it'll fall under car laws
instead of motorcycle laws.
Con? Any questions? Senator Alvers. Is this your first bill represented
brilliantly? Yes sir. This bill has been through this general assembly a few
times the past you familiar with the history of it? I've been told that recently.
Are you a floor leader for Chairman Powell by chance? No I'm not. Are you related to
Representative Jason Ridley. No sir. I could answer. Follow up. Yeah you got a chance.
Yeah yeah. Thank you. All right. Well thank you. Did anybody else want to come out

Senator Setslore there, did you have something?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, it's not on the yellow sheet yet,
but House Bill 204, Representative Yeard,
it's a local government bill that both creates a council
of municipal court clerks, so they can start receiving funds
and try to professionalize the operation of municipal courts.
It also clarifies that the counties do not
have the power to reapportion themselves.
That was a proposition that we discussed here in the Senate, but just the timing of crossover
Didn't make it across the go lines. There's two ideas of both moving into your house bill 204 glad to take questions

permitting and construction to 180 days. It also limits them from entering into another
