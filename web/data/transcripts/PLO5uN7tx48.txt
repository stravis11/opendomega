----------
You
You
The meeting to order, our second meeting of the year, good to have everybody here today.
I've got two bills on our agenda, yes, and whatever else Senator Albers may have.
I was just wondering as soon as we got a kind of a light load and we can get things right
and the four if we might be able to full Senate bill 163
to help our small brewers and loosen up those alcohol
licenses and put that on here today as well.
Well, we didn't have enough fun on Tuesday.
You want to lie down next to everybody's here today.
I guess we will have our affected lobbyists will come.
Do you see Casey or Mark here today?
Must not be.
All right, well, I'll move that to the bottom list.
But we will begin with a couple of easier things
before we dismantle the three-tier system.
without having to go through the rules committee.
That will be fun.
I have just a couple of here for us.
And these are both bills that passed out of committee last year
and passed out a rules committee.
And we're put on the rules calendar for day 40.
And they just didn't get reached.
There was no decision made, not to call them up.
It was just a timing element.
I don't believe either a controversial, but we will plan to take action on these today if there's the will of the committee to do so
since there
Bills that we've already dealt with the result of that is that they will be the committee report would be read tomorrow
And I would anticipate that they'll be on the calendar the Monday after
Our budget week if that's what you gentlemen won't if you do not let's at least discuss them today
So that we're in a posture where we could act on these quickly on the Tuesday following the the budget break
Senator Lucas so glad you could join us today
Oh, we do have an alcohol obvious that suddenly has appeared here. All right. You better call your friends
So we will call House Bill 455, Representative John LaHood.
If you'll take that microphone, we'll light you up there and on the podium.
Just give us a brief overview.
It's just a very few pages and tell us, remind us what you had before it's last year.
Yes, sir.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee for having me back.
And I presented this bill fairly late in the session last year.
It did pass to committee unanimously, a non-controversial.
But this is basically creates a safe haven for physicians and other credentialed health
care workers to go seek services such as counseling to come about burnout and career fatigue,
which is a documented, you know, known problem.
So in this era, when we're battling tough workforce,
crisis, health care is not immune to that.
And what we want to do is create a safe place
and encourage physicians and other health care workers
to go seek help and stay in the game instead
of silently suffering and compromising their ability
to render good services.
So is there something that blocks that now,
or how does this make that a safe place
or an easier for the confidentiality?
Give us a, if you could direct me to what we do here,
just that they don't have to report.
Correct.
So the counselor, for example,
that would be seeing the physician
is not required to report to the licensing board
unless they see a reasonable,
Unless there's a probable cause for them to think this would put any of their patients
in at risk.
So it encourages healthcare professionals to seek help without fear of it jeopardizing
their licensing or their reputation.
Correct.
I like that.
Are there questions from the committee?
I'll send it again.
You number three, I believe.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate you, Bill, I kind of curious, I don't know how the medical profession does
their licensing, but does this same board, is that the board that would require continuing
education or anything like that, and does this exempt them from any continuing education
that they may be moving forward with or requirements in that regard?
But not exempt them from any continuing ad.
Let's see, online, 18, it defines what licensing board means,
and it lists the Georgia Board of Nursing,
Georgia Composite Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy.
Those are the professions that would be covered.
But no, it does not exempt them from any continuing ad.
OK, thank you.
Does that answer your question?
Yeah, I just, you know, I know if we look at other professions
you know each one of them has a board and sometimes they have to have a you
know reporting on different things whether they're continuing ads up to date
and things there so I just want to make sure that we're not not it's mainly for
health care. Good question and no I don't say we just compromises or reduces the
requirement for read for to keep their license at all this just keeps helps to
keep them, like I said, in the game and removes that fear of, you know, putting their license
in jeopardy because they're basically seeking help for career fatigue or burnout.
Thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Chairman, if you're ready, I'll be glad to make a move.
Let's see if anybody else has a question first, but I'll be ready pretty quickly.
Anybody else have questions for the author of the bill?
All right, then I will recognize you.
Senator again, if you have a motion.
Mr. Chairman, I do pass LC3393999 House Bill 5455.
We have a second from Senator Rett.
Is there any discussion on the do pass motion?
Then I'll watch the pleasure of the members of the board.
We're going to be a board today, I'll raise your hand.
We were yesterday or the other day at work, I thought I'd give it a whirl.
I do, Madam Leader.
What should we call ourselves today?
You have a privilege.
A privilege committee.
It is very much a privilege to be on this one.
Okay, all in favor, raise your hand please
and let's raise them enough for our counters
to keep count and name, look at that,
it appears to be unanimous.
Thank you so much for doing this
to help your folks with their burnout
so they'll be refreshed and healthy mentally
and physically to take care of the patients.
Well, thank you for your consideration
and we do need a sponsor.
Senator Alberts has agreed to sponsor in the Senate.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was wondering if we could get confidential treatment, that might be good for us all, I like that.
All right, my sweet mate has arrived from his afternoon nap, we are ready to go.
I started to slam that door on the way out of the sweet, make sure we got you up.
but all right Senate bill now 205 Senator Rick Williams again we have a bill
that passed our committee last year passed out of rules committee and went to
the rules calendar but did not get reached for action so it was recommitted to
us on Monday and this has no changes whatsoever from last year and it's only
two pages so I'm gonna turn it over to you Senator if you'll explain what you
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is a very simple bill, like Mr. Chairman stated,
it passed through last year unanimous.
This is just allowing someone who's inadvertently
let their license lapse to renew them.
And no changes, same bill this from last year.
I think it'll see 36, 5, 4, 9, 6, is that correct?
That is what we're working off of.
Everybody has that in their folders.
Okay, great, thank you, sir.
But I'll be glad to answer any questions.
Are there any questions for Senator Williams?
All right, now's the appropriate time
on recognizing Senator Alvers for a motion.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, moved you past Senate Bill 205.
They'll see 35, 54, 96, 36.
That'll see 36.
96.
36.
I thought you said that'll see 35.
35 54 96 oh 36 I'm sorry there you got to pay attention details all right
I'm telling what you might have just put move to put on the floor there second
all right we have a second from senator again is there any discussion all right
all in favor of passage of the motion do pass Senate bill 205 LC 36 5 4 9 6
raise your hand please. And any opposed? Any abstaining? You vote? You're going to
abstain there, Luke. Is that was that a yay or a nay? That's a yay. And it is unanimous.
We have had people sneak out here and avoid votes, but it's rare that once
and it's bold enough to sit in the seat and just not vote.
Couple of, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I thank you.
Senator, do you have, you're gonna carry that yourself
on presume, right?
Yes, sir.
I'll carry it to the floor, thank you.
I believe it'll be Monday week, but we'll see.
I'll be the follow-up.
All right.
I'll fund aside that from Senator Albers and myself early.
We are pretty formal in this committee and it's really just in a interest of fairness
to the members of the legislature, the lobbyists that are representing their clients in the
general public.
There's a rare exception but almost always we only take up bills on the agenda and we
We try our very best to publish it at least 24 hours before our meetings.
Our meetings are scheduled, they're pre-set, the Secretary of the Senate has us down
on Tuesdays at 4 o'clock and Thursdays at 2 o'clock.
I try to do the more complicated issues on Tuesdays because nobody meets after us in
this room.
And if we have to run over, you know, to as late as 6 o'clock, we'll do that.
We are tightly bound on Thursdays from two to three.
In fact, Senator Albers' Committee meets at three today.
Public safety might even be in this same room, is it?
Okay.
So we're never able to go longer.
It would be an extremely rare thing for a bill to be considered in this committee that
you didn't have adequate notice of.
We also send in on show and we'll retry very best if there is a committee sub to make
copies available and have them in my office 432 for somebody to pick up as soon as
they're ready for us and we note on the agenda that it is a committee sub so
there are changes and just so you'll know the procedures and if you're ever
wondering and there won't be just a whole full of rumors on what's going on
that's how we play the game here we do have a rule that committee
sub need to be presented to the chair 24 hours in advance of a meeting that
that sounds better on paper sometimes
and then when we get later in the session
and things are flying, it's a little difficult.
But if it's significant change,
we're not gonna stick something in front of us
that we haven't had time to review and question
and come up with proposed amendments.
If there's small changes, I encourage members
just to bring them as an amendment to the meeting.
So you're not guaranteed that won't be changes made
on a bill that we're considering,
but if it's a significant revamped
that requires a committee substitute,
we try our very best to let you have notice in advance
so you can digest those changes
and be prepared to speak to them
or ask us questions about those.
So we were teasing when we said
we're about to dismantle the three tier system.
If there are other suggestions on how we can better run
this committee for our constituents,
let us know we'll do what we can.
I was disappointed when we got the pre-noticed to you
about our committee dinner.
That's gonna be Tuesday, January 23rd,
when Lo and behold the venue,
which is the 57th Fighter Group,
told us they were hosting the trivia night
that night and we were no longer invited.
But they are able to do it on Wednesday,
is it February 7th?
Anybody got a problem with that date?
not, you know, save that date now. We have quite a few people have already asked to help
us sponsor it. We love you. We got room for many more if you'd like to. We had a great
time last year, good food and actually had a DJ on the dance floor later and had a lot
of good com, Rodry laughed about some of our stories of the various bills that have come
through this committee and love to have your participation again this year. Anything
further from committee members, would you like to announce before we adjourn?
All right, thanks so much for being here, meeting adjourned.
