Now the Georgia flag, please. I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag, the principles for which it stands, wisdom, justice, and moderation. What a joy, what a joy, what a joy. It is such an honor for me to introduce to you all. Bishop Diane Reed Collins is a 21st century vanguard and a people pusher. She was born in Memphis, Tennessee and credits whatever degree of success she has achieved in life to God. And praying mother, a wonderful family, a faith walk in mentor and friend. As a child, she was particularly fascinated with the arts, whether it was theatrics, music, drawing, or public speaking. Diane would always stand out when opportunity arose, will want a more of these God-given graces. She received a bachelor's of arts degree in communication and fine arts from Memphis State University, now University of Memphis, where her theatric abilities left its mark. Upon relocating to Atlanta, Georgia, area, she received a master's of divinity degree from the inter-denominational theological center. Diane has served as founder and senior pastor of 31 of Faith Walk Ministries Inc. For approximately 31 OMG, 31 years Faith Walk located in College Park, Georgia, that's Senate District 34. The vision for the church is to provide a climate where saints and seekers can experience the love of God through the worship and receive spiritual nourishment needed to help them reach their God-given potential through Christ. She was consecrated at Bishop in September of 2006. Her pastor, Bishop Jonathan Greer II, she oversees various ministries which include satellite and affiliated churches in Georgia area. She approves Chabalee, keeps her grounds, and keeps it real. I am so honored to bring this beautiful Bishop from Senate District 34 to bless this Senate this morning. Bishop Collins? I would like to thank the Governor, to all of the members of the Senate and to my dear Senator Valencia-C. I will be reading a devotional excerpt from one of the books I have written and it's entitled Room for the Gift. In Proverbs 18 and 16 we find these words, a man's gift make it room for him and bring it him before great men. Theater has always been one of my first loves. I was a member of the Waterford Theatrical Guild when I attended Hamilton High School and I also became a member of a lot of the local groups after graduating from high school. One summer I auditioned for a popular stage play entitled Purly and was given the lead female role. At the time I was also the only musician at my church and had to miss a couple of the play rehearsals due to schedule conflicts. When I resumed play rehearsals the director had given my part to another cast member and informed me that I was now her understudy and a member of the chorus. The director was angry with me because I had missed the first two rehearsals. I had worked diligently on all the lead songs for this character Ludibale while I was out. I was tempted to resign from the production altogether but my friends convinced me to stay. Two weeks before the play opened the director and music director asked the young lady who they had given my role to and me to meet with them and go over all the music. They wanted to hear both of us sing all of the lead songs and boy was I ready. She sang first and she had this beautiful operatic tone to her voice and when it was my turn I had this gospel jazz-y style when I sang. And they fell in love with it. That was the day God made room for my gift. The director and the music director had a private meeting with me and I will never forget the director's words. He said, Diane, I know we took the lead part from you a few weeks ago but we want to give it back to you. We know you are the one that we need for this part and we understand that you are a musician at your church and you may not be able to make all of the play rehearsals but guess what? We are willing to work around your schedule. Would you please take this role again? The other young lady will be your understudy now. What do you say? I respond it? Okay, I'll take the part. The other young lady and I were good friends and there were no harsh feelings between us. The production was a big hit and we played to sold our crowds for two weeks straight. We even ran the next summer and I continued to play Ludabelle in Perle. So what am I saying? Whatever gift you have God's word says it will make room for you. You don't have to force anything, you don't have to sabotage anybody else's gift to get ahead. All you have to do is just polish and perfect the gift you have and when our God opportunity comes your way you will be ready. Sometimes you may feel as if you are being overlooked or ignored but it's not that way all the time. God is just setting the stage for your big debut. Keep a positive attitude and stay prepared. Do not under any circumstances leave this earth with your gifts still locked inside of you if you'll stand for prayer. Eternal God, we come before your presence in the name of your son Jesus Christ. We thank you Lord God for waking us this morning and blessing us with the gift of another day. Every day you give us it is a day for us to make a difference in somebody's life. And so we thank you for thinking enough of us to bless us with this new day. We thank you Lord God for this Senate meeting. We thank you for this sacred place. A lot of decisions have been made within these walls that have affected a whole lot of Georgians. And so God, we just turned this meeting over to you today and we ask that you would be glorified by whatever is said and done. We thank you for each member of the Senate. We thank you for their families because God they could not do what they do without the support of a loving family. So we thank you for their family members. We ask right now that you would bless the governor in a very special way from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet. You have given all of us gifts in this room and God help us to ever be mindful that we owe you how to do our best at everything we put our hands to. We thank you and we give you the glory. We come against every hindering spirit. Everything that the enemy would do to try to cause confusion. And so discord we rebuke it right now in the name of Jesus. Now God do what you do best and we'll thank you and praise you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Light of rich. I'm trying to. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You If I could have everybody's attention real quick.

I'd like to recognize some very special guests we have here in the room today. We've got the four-time defending state champions, four-time descending state champions, John Billidge Academy here today. We've got the team up here in the gallery. Y'all, y'all give these young men a round of applause real quick. John Billidge Academy is located in Millageville, Georgia. Their head football coach is a former teammate of mine from the University of Georgia, a young man by name of J.T. Wall. He's in his 12th year as the head football coach there. They are in the last four years. They just broke a state record of 50 wins in a row. These young men right here have never lost a high school football game right here. 50 in a row, that's pretty impressive. I told J.T. we're going to get him an office down here because he comes down here so much with always winning. He showed me their ring right here. This was one of the smaller state title rings they have. I told him I wanted him to make me a set of brass knuckles out of the four championships because I might use them between now and day 40. I want to thank them for being down here. Obviously, the senator from the 25th is proud to have him here as well. Y'all give head coach J.T. Wall a round of applause here. Thank you all for having us. Thank you to Lieutenant Governor and Senator Williams. They told me to say a quick story about Lieutenant Governor, but I don't want to give you any more ammunition than you need. But once again, we appreciate you all having us and look forward to seeing you all next year. Thank you. I always have the doctor of the day with us and I'll call on the senator from the 56 to recognize our doctor of the day. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very excited to have Dr. Anza Anderson with us today from Marietta. She did her residency in internship at Drexel University of Medicine in Philadelphia. She did her undergraduate work at Kiel University in England and then her doctor to medicine in St. George's University. She's got an amazing resume and background. She currently serves as a doctor at the North Atlanta primary care in Marietta as well as her alpha-route of location. She's got numerous volunteer community and outreach work that she does. And in her spare time, she likes baking and cooking and reading and traveling. It is my pleasure to introduce our doctor of the day, Dr. Anderson. Thank you so much for having me here today. I won't take up much of your time, but it's my pleasure to serve here for you today as a doctor of the day as we also kick off physicians this week as well. Thank you also much for all of your tireless work as you helped pass laws that dictate our practice in Georgia and serve patients. And thank you. All right. Good job. Thank you. We're going to do a picture right there. Thank you. Does any Senator wish a rise on a point of personal privilege? I recognize, Senator, from the 15th, the Dean of the Senate. Good morning and thank you, Mr. President. I would like to honor some people in the gallery as well as a young man who has did a lot of work to recognize people in uniform. In the Senate gallery, we have Major Thornail King, Department of Public Safety, Gareth Clark, President Georgia Firefighters Association, much heirs, President Georgia Police Chiefs Association, Ken Bohannon, Georgia Ambassador, Mission 22, Steve Rogers, Georgia Ambassador, National Enforcement Officers, Memorial and CEO, Sirman's Task Force, and who originated this amendment, this proposal, Ginger Rogers Secretary of Servants Task Force, Terry Norse and Michael Mitchell, President and Legal Affairs of the Georgia Shifts Association. And the resolution for the entire group reads honoring the men and women who have served our serving or will one day either serve in law enforcement, the military branches of the United States, or as firefighters and recognize in May 2023 as United and Uniforms Recognition and Memorial Month and for other purposes. Where's the men and women from the state of Georgia have taken the oath and placed a heed the call of those in danger at any time? Serve and protect the citizens and properties of Georgia, defend our freedoms against enemies both foreign and domestic and be willing to pay the last full measure. The month of May, currently holds in a National Firefighters Day, Police Week and Memorial Day Weekend, all of which honor our uniformed heroes for their service and sacrifices within our state and within our nation. Where it's from time to time, the creation of the first department in 1736, the first police department, 1844 and the first military branch in America, 1784. Men and women have raised their hands for allegiance and do a rigorous training and given their lives for other citizens and loved ones in our state and nation both upon our solar and overseas. Where as it is abundantly fitting and proper that these valued men and women be appropriately honored. Now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that members of this body recognize May 2023 as uniform recognition and memorial month and honor those who have served or serving or who will serve in duty on behalf of the United States. Be it resolved further that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and other areas. Signed by Senator Harbison the 15th, Robinson of the 29th, Alruz of the 56th and Romain of the 5th. President of the Senate, President Jones, President of Pro Temp Kennedy, Senator Harbison Secretary of the Senate, David Cook. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is my first well speech. I waited until I had something of gravity before coming before you today. After seeing an event last week at 141 prior street, I realized what this speech was going to be. I come before you today to thank you for your decorum, to thank you for your politeness when we disagree, to thank my friends from across the aisle for welcoming a freshman legislator from North Fulton who even went a lot of bad, false press preceded my arrival to this chamber. To thank my friends, regardless of politics, for not race baiting, for not name calling, for not belittling the offices to which we were elected by hurling insults. Because what happened last week at 141 prior street, the home of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners was one of the grossest displays of racial discrimination I've seen in many years. In fact, I've never seen it happen in this modern era. During a discussion on the adoption of a resolution authorizing the Fulton County attorney to file a complaint with the DOJ requesting an investigation of well star, one of the commissioners gave an approximately 10 minute long description of the financial issues that led to the closure of two hospitals in South Fulton. I listened to the entire hearing and as someone who has a decade of experience in health care administration, I can say that many of her data points seem to accurate from a fiscal perspective. You see, Commissioner Bridget Thorn represents North Fulton. Her heritage is half Latina, born of a Mexican mother. She is my commissioner and she is my friend. But because of what she looks like, because she gave a financial overview of the reasons why she thinks well star made the decisions they did for the hospital closures, she was mocked and she was ridiculed. Let me be specifically clear. She was called White Privilege in a Karen by her fellow commissioner, Aarrington. She was called White Privilege four times by fellow commissioner, Abderaman. Commissioner Abderaman doubled down later and said, White privilege can turn into white tears at any minute. And board chairman Pits didn't say a word and let the attacks unfold upon her without any recourse. So with that, I encourage my colleagues to join me in condemning this racial hatred from two of our Fulton commissioners and to defend any commissioners right to be able to express their opinions that as an elected official, they are entitled to speak about an issue just as we are. I commend and appreciate Commissioner Thorn for her strength and composure during those attacks. She represents her constituents well and she made many valid points. She did not deserve any of the foul words spoken against her and I am proud for how she handled the situation and represents Fulton County. And with that, I thank all of my friends in this chamber, Republican and Democrat for not bringing those words that hatred and that poor character into the Senate. Thank you. We're going to send her from the eighth for Point of Personal Privilees from Lowns County, Georgia, blueberry, proud and true. Thank you, Mr. President. What did I come here for? Oh, colleagues, the sportsman's caucus raffle is going to close on Sunny Dye and so there's a whole lot less of us than our house members and so if you will come by my office at 301 and see Rachel and by ticket, it goes to the raffling off handgun and it's going to go to the sportsman's caucus and also Mr. President. I brought up 48 pounds of cobbler today from back home and this so want to thank our Commissioner of Ag for allowing us to use his oven and Miss Kathy Cassava for helping me get it cooked and we're going to send out for ice cream. So later today we're going to be eating cobbler and ice cream and I'm going to get the senator in the from the 27th wearing husky pants like me before it's over with. Mr. President, I yield the will. Recognize the senator from the 24th. Thank you, Mr. President. I just come to the well today to thank each and every one of you for this cards, your prayers, phone calls for this past weekend when Donna and I, her mother passed away but I just want to thank you all from bottom of my heart. I love each and every one of you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator and I thought some prayers are with you and your family during this time, Senator. Mother and law had a had a good life though, 94 years young, right? Now, 94, son. But keep a keep a senator from the 24th and you thought some prayers, please. Senator from the 11th. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief. Just wanted to rise today to let everyone know that this is the National Farm Worker Awareness Week. We have over 2.6 million farm workers that come to the United States to allow us to eat three meals a day. We have 35,000 that come to the state of Georgia to allow each one of y'all to eat today. They leave their families, their spouses, their mamas and their daddies and they come work here in the United States so that we can all have food. They are highly skilled. They are essential and they are very important to agriculture in the state of Georgia and across our nation. And just before I leave, I just wanted to say, grussiest poor travel har in Los Campos, Agri-Cola. So thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator. And I'll send it to you from 17th. Thank you, Mr. President. Today is Newton County Day at the Capitol. And I believe we have some folks in Newton County up in the gallery with us today. A couple of folks up there, some from our school system and county leadership and economic development folks up there. And we're proud to have y'all up here at the Capitol today. On your desk, you have a bag. A few things, one of our big employers that's decided to make Newton County a home. Bridgestone, you have some swag in a bag here. And you get ready for a little golf tournament. I think it's going to be the next couple of weeks if I remember correctly. And so proud to have you guys up here, proud to represent Newton County a place that so many people, so many companies are wanting to call home here in the east side of Atlanta. If y'all would please help me recognize some of our friends up in the gallery. Thank you. We're going to ask Senator from the 13th. Good morning colleagues. I want to introduce you all to my first grandchild, Jackson Daniel Green. That's awesome. He's got his bowtown. He's ready for his Senate run. And I hope to turn it over to him very soon. I really do. And I have my beautiful daughter Jade here with me today. Obviously the mother. So hey buddy. Hey. Hey. Hey, get your picture. Thank you. Thanks for the gift. Oh wow. Look at him. All right. He's a cutie. Alright. Recognize Senator from the 49th. Good morning, colleagues. A few minutes ago, the senator from the 11th came and spoke about this week being National Farm Workers Appreciation Day. And I want to take a moment to highlight that as well. You know, many of you know that my husband is one of the owners of J. More Farm and kind of runs the place. But we brought someone with us today who actually does run and make everything happen. We have Kenny Valenzuela in the back. Kenny is one of our H2A workers that comes to our farm every year to work for us and with us. Kenny's background is he's a lawyer for the governor of Mexico City. He practices for women and children. He facilitates divorces and child support and elementary recovery. Kenny has a big heart and a strong back. But Kenny takes care of our family's farm and he is a part of our family. He's been coming to our farm every year since 2016. This is a contract that Kenny signs and chooses to come work with us every year. He leaves his family at home and he comes here to help us. He manages our crews, our wholesale orders and he's our liaison between the farm labor and management. Kenny chooses to come here because he can make more money coming to America working on our farm than he can make as a lawyer in Mexico City. He chooses to do that year after year after year and we're certainly appreciative of him. So I just wanted to take a moment to bring Kenny down to the Capitol today to show him what I do and to show him our appreciation for he and the others who do what they do for us. Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. I recognize Senator from the 39th. We're appointed personal privilege. Thank you Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. So I am excited to introduce you today to some exceptional young ladies who are joining us in the gallery. You will notice them by their crowns. We have Miss Atlanta, Audrey, Kiddela, Miss Capitol City, Tara, Shipcoff, Miss Greater Atlanta, Melanie Yang, Miss Capitol City's teen, Riley Wolf Rock, and Miss Greater Atlanta's teen, Carrington, Manus. These ladies will be competing at Miss Georgia this June, which the winners will go on to compete at Miss America and Miss America's teen. They will promote their individual platforms which range from mental health awareness, overcoming failure and enhancing educational opportunities for all students. Would you please rise and join me to welcome these ladies to the Georgia Senate. Rise everybody and clap for these wonderful young ladies. Thank you very much. I yield the floor. I recognize Senator from the 42nd from the Point of Personal Pritla. Thank you Mr. President. Seeing the center from the 13th adorable grand baby made me decide to get up and share some good personal news that I have, which is that some of you know my wonderful father was diagnosed with lymphoma in December and has been undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma since. And halfway through treatment we got some scans and we got his results and the tumor has shrunk by two thirds already and its ability to cause harm has gone from a seven to a two and the doctor said no less than three times that my father was amazing because he is so strong and his hair has not even fallen out from chemo. That is how well he is doing. So just wanted to say daddy I love you very much. My dad's 85 and we think he will live to 105. Thank you. I yield the well. Bring it out. The majority leader. Thank you Mr. President. Senators we have some special guests up in the gallery. I would like to recognize if you are familiar with the sole commissioner of former government we have one in our presence today. The Union County Commissioner Mr. Lamar Paris he and I was elected in 2001 together and I have known him for 22 years and I have been a great friendship. We also have the mayor of Blair'sville Mr. Jim Conley in the gallery and over to their left is our friend Mike Beatty that most of you know as coach. They are doing a great job up in Union County working on workforce development and they are working on a community champions initiative which provides our young people with career opportunities like skill coaching and mentorship that leads to thriving families and exciting futures. Y'all please give a warm Senate welcome to my friends from Union County. Thank you very much. I said that single county commission thing works as long as you got out of the way and got in the Senate you know. I said just start working great then. All right the senator from the 29th. Thank you Mr. President. Colleagues and friends and those that are state directors around Georgia I want to thank each and everybody for reaching out this weekend when we had severe weather strike my district primarily in troop and mayor weather county where a lot of damage was caused but like everything that happens in district 29 it's a little different than most parks in the state of Georgia. We had a tremendous outpouring of support to get all the trees cleared up and to clear up anybody's concern the two tigers that escaped and we're running free through the district they were captured and put back where they were where they were used to living so when you come through district 29 I want you to know that the roads are clear and all the wildlife is back where where it belongs.

House bill 121, a bill to be entitled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 52 of the official Code of Georgia and itated. We're relating to registration, operation, and sale of watercraft generally. So is to provide the restrictions and requirements regarding wake surfing and wakeboarding. The committee on the Senate on Transportation recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully, Senator Dole's all the 27th District Chairman. The Senate Committee on Transportation offers the following substitute to House Bill 121. Ability to be entitled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 52 of the official Code of Georgia and itated relating to registration, operation, and sale of watercraft generally. So is to provide for restrictions and requirements relative to wake surfing and wakeboarding in certain instances. To provide for exceptions, to provide for definitions, to amend Title 40 of the official Code of Georgia and itated. Relating to motor vehicles and traffic, so is to provide for a definition, to provide for the operation of multipurpose off highway vehicles on certain highways. That completes the order, Mr. President. We're just stand by, we're working on a bill. The no-fun bill has problems right now. You have to be able to provide for the operation of the vehicle. I'm going to go ahead and recognize the senator from the 18th. They are working on a friendly amendment to the bill, so but we'll go ahead and recognize the pro-tum to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. Present a fun little bill to you that's going to fix a problem that we've got. So it's a good bill for Georgia and a good bill for Georgia's lakes and a good bill for folks that enjoy recreational Georgia's lakes. The problem is we've got a fun sport called wake surfing and wakeboarding that creates big wakes because it's a boat that's designed to create a big wake that you can ride behind the boat. On the either on the wake itself or be pulled behind it and you can jump as you're using your wakeboard. And it's a lot of fun, but the problem is the large wakes that are being created are causing property damages, it's causing damages to boats, it's causing damages and safety issues. And it's causing some advanced erosion issues in the lakes around our state. So this is, as I said, it's a fun sport. So what 121 does is simply fix the problem by creating a 200 foot setback from the lakeshore or the apartments or docks that you have to keep your, if you're involved in that activity and you're pulling someone doing one of those two activities that you have to say 200 feet off of that line. This is consistent with South Carolina and Tennessee already have a 200 foot setback requirement. So it puts us in conformity with them, which will be good from an enforcement standpoint. DNR came and testified at the hearing and presented on this and they are in full support of this. And it's, as I said, it's going to be something good for not just the property owners, but people that enjoy boating and also people that interact with folks that do wakeboarding and wake surfing. There's also a second portion of the bill that deals with side by sides. And this is to create a program, an optional program. It's not mandatory, but an optional program permitting and issuing license plates to side by sides. And for those of you that don't know what side by sides are, you can think of utility vehicles that are made by John Deere, by Polaris. And Anne makes some of them also are made by Gator that we call them. But all of these are used for recreation to do a lot of things. Georgia does not provide license plates for these vehicles, but surrounding states do. And many of our residents with these vehicles would like, or they have to go seek out-of-state registration and get a title in North Carolina or Tennessee, for example, in those states in order to be able to cross lines to enjoy the recreation and use of the vehicle. For our residents that take these vehicles across state lines, they have to have the ability to register and receive a license plate for their vehicles. But those residents that use those vehicles locally, maybe on a farm, won't have to get a license plate. Simply going back to the point of, if you have one of these and you don't necessarily want to drive on county roads, you don't have to register, you don't have to get a tag. But if you do, and you want to drive on county roads, or you want to cross state lines, this legislation simply enables you to go get a license plate for your vehicle and drive it and use it in more ways than they folks currently can that own these. There's a friendly amendment coming that changes just one aspect of what was required to ensure that there's no TAVT that's applied to these vehicles and to conform with some Department of Revenue concerns that came up about how vehicles are going to be able to be used. How vehicles are licensed, which is typically tagged to a vehicle identification number, these units, these type of machines, don't have a vence.

We're trying to satisfy that last little issue so that DNR is fine with it. As far as I know, all the stakeholders are supportive of this. It's a good thing for folks that enjoy the lakes and rivers. It's a good thing for folks that own property. It's a good thing for folks that just want to make sure that we've got a safe environment on our lakes so that people enjoy that recreational activity can do so and continue to do so safely. And if you've got a side by side, it's going to expand your ability of where you can drive that safely as well. We'll have that amendment hopefully be passed out any moment now. You do have a couple questions. Okay, Mr. President, happy to answer questions. Senator from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. Will the Senator yield? I'll be happy to to my friend over from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. Brartem. Is it not true that I appreciate this bill and support it? And thank you for your work on it? You do, Senator. And I appreciate your thoughts on that and your support for this. And recognition that we've got a little problem that we need to fix. And this is the way to do it. Thank you for your support. Well, I would agree. Would you further yield? Certainly. Isn't it true that research both in Georgia scientific studies and in other states have found that when operating in their usual formats, wake surf boats actually do need a much wider distance than we have called for in this bill, about 450 or 500 feet from shore, for the waves to diminish enough to match waves created by typical boats that are 200 feet from shore. Senator, I'm aware of some of those statistics and data. And as someone who gets aggravated with the big rollers that come in and calls destruction and problems and safety issues. But this 200 foot setback creates, I think, a fairly carefully balanced approach to this. Certainly, some people would like to have more. Some people would like to have less, but this 200 foot setback requires or puts us in line with states that are around us. And thank you for that information. Thank you. Reagan, I was Senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President, with the Senator Yeal. I'll be happy to my distinguished friend from Halston County. Senator, I'm not as familiar with this as bill as I should be on the side by side part. I assume that it requires the same type of auto insurance if you're going to be on the road as a private passenger auto would require. Senator, I think if I think that would be the case based upon the sections, the OCEGA code sections in which this is being amended, I think that would be the case. Because it's not a carve out specifically for this, but the existing code structure and existing codification of these requirements, this is simply added to the list of what can be done. So I think that would be the case, yes, sir. Okay, well, I'll try to confirm that. Okay, I think you would agree, wouldn't you, that is important. I think so, Senator. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the question. You have another question. Senator, from the first. Thank you, Mr. President, Senator Hild. I certainly do. So this, if someone owns a private lake of which I don't, but if you did, would this law have any effect on them? It would not. It would not. At the top of the bill, you'll notice, and I'll see if I can find the language, but in essence, these provisions that we have here talk about regulations that apply to the waterways of the state of Georgia. And that term as defined elsewhere in the code does not include private lakes. Okay, thank you, Senator. Yes, sir. You have another further question, Senator. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. And I'll wheel the wheel. We can read the amendment. And you speak to the amendment if you like, or if you get Senator from 13th, speak to it, which we're warning you on. Go ahead and yield, and we'll let some. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hild. Thank you for your consideration of this, and I'd urge your vote. Yes, for the bill and for the amendment that's being offered. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. We do have a friendly amendment. Amendment one. Secretary, read the caption. Senator's summer of the 13th and Gucci of the 51st offered the following amendment to House Bill 121. By changing license plate on lines 124, 127, and 128 to operating permit, changing September 1, 2023 to January 1, 2024 on line 131. Strike Section 2-6. Strike Section 2-7. Starting at line 153, strike issued a certificate of title and end quote. Back in place, the order, Mr. President. I recognize Senator from the 13th speaks to the amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. A colleague, this is a friendly amendment. Thank you. It will work. Senator from the 18th is done on this bill here. This just cleans up some language that makes sure that we're in a copacetic with things that go on on regarding DR and allows us place, et cetera, et cetera. Please vote for the amendment and the bill. Mr. President, I yield a well. Senator, is yielded the well. Does any other senator wish to speak for against a measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. On amendment number one, from the senator from the 13th, is there objection to amendment number one? Without objection, amendment number one is added. Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute, as amended, is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? As amended, hearing none, the committee substitute, as amended, is adopted. Is there objection to a green authority committee which is favourable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board, to be in ordered. Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute all those in favor of the bill vote. Yeah, you pose nay secretary and lot of the machine on the passage of the no fun bill. Yees are 51 the nays are two and this bill having received the directs of the constitution majority is therefore passed by substitute. Oh my goodness, no more fun on the lake. No more fun on the lake. I have to tell my 10 year old can you go surfing anymore? I'm kidding. It's fine. All right, moving on. HB 182. Secretary read the caption. HB 182. A bill to be entitled an act towards one of Article one of Chapter two of Title 44 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to recording of deeds and other real property transactions. So is revised provisions for carrying defective deeds and other instruments to comport with a legislative correction recommended by the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pungora loan servicing LLC V Scarver. The Senate the committee on the Senate on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute respectfully senator Strickland of the 17th district chairman. Senate Judiciary offers the following substitute to House bill 182 a bill to be entitled an act Part one of Article one of Chapter two of Title 44 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to recording of deeds and other real property transactions. So is to revise provisions for carrying defective deeds and other instruments to comport with a legislative correction. Recommended by the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pungora loan servicing LLC V Scarver. That completes the order, Mr. President. We're going to have the senator from the 17th. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate have very exciting property lawyer bill for you. It does two things. One, it addresses a federal case from last year that called into question our ability to fix defective deeds. Very exciting stuff, but this case required us to go back and amend our code section that makes certain that we can treat all deeds that you have on property security deeds the same. We have 30 seconds yawning on me. And so it cleans up that in Section one and in Section two and three of the bill, we and Judiciary Committee added in provisions that create a due process situation where you foreclose on Tom shares last year. We've got a Tom share foreclosure bill that allows folks that are foreclosing on Tom shares in our state to go through one, what I would call pretty quick path that's much easier. This was requested by from some of our larger companies that want to come in and have a more complex process that would help with tile insurance issues. Or you can use either process if you want. There was no opposition we heard on either issue. Happy answering your questions, Mr. President. Otherwise asked for your support. You have no question senator. Thank you ask for support of House bill one a two. Thank you. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure. Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair here is none of the previous questions ordered. Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute here in the community substitute adopted. Is there objection to greens with order committee was this favor to the passes of the bill chair here is none the poor committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered chair here is none and the main question is ordered questions on the passes of the bill by substitute all those in favor vote. Yeah pose nay secretary and lot of machines. You錢 senator from the 21stonds purpose do you rise. I think we're- Statue your inquiry. You know, I just noticed the house only has 12 bills on their calendar and I think we have 68 plus some bills that have been tabled. And we seem to be running very efficient. We've already went through five. I have a concern about that, Mr. President. Your concern is duly noted, Senator. And you know, in fact, we might be able to break from lunch here, lawyerly. Might not come back. How about that? It could be a motion. So, but we're going to do our duty. We're going to do the duty at lies nearest right now and keep working. So, moving on to House Bill 227, Secretary Reed the caption. I'm sorry, 16, Secretary Reed the caption. I'm sorry. House Bill 186, a bill to be entitled an act to amend Title V of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to appeal and error so as to revise an exception applicable to the filing of petitions for review and reviewing courts from lower Judic Coutories to make conforming changes to amend code section 36-32-2.1 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to removal of judges. The committee of the Senate on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass respectfully submitted Senator Strickland of the 17th District Chairman. That completes the order, Mr. President. Recognize the senator from the 18th. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you colleagues. This is truly a simple bill. House Bill 186, if you remember from last year, House Bill 916 that we all passed, I think it was unanimously, came out of committee, where we modified the process by which the appellate process works when things are repealed from the Superior Court. We updated the process and quite frankly just missed a couple of terms. If you'll see, for example, lines 27, the reference to search your or Denovov proceedings is changed to petition for review. That's also seen online 35 and also seen online 45. So this is a cleanup to some items that were missed last year. This does not change anyone's substantive rights for appellate procedures such as applying for search your or anything of that regard. Be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you. I urge your support and I appreciate your support for this and I'll yield the well. Does any of the Senator wish to rise, speak for, against the bill? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to a Greens Rewarded Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Rewarded Committee is agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. And the main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill? All those in favor vote, yay. Opposed nay, Secretary-Town Lightning Machine. Thank you. The bill is ordered. The bill is ordered. The bill is ordered. The constitution of majority has therefore passed. Moving on to House Bill 227. Secretary Reed, the caption. House Bill 227. A bill to be entitled on an act to amend Title 16 of the official code of the bill. Court is on the move. Court is on an act to amend Title 16 of the official code of Georgia Annotated, relating to crimes and offenses. So as to provide for the Offensive Criminal Interference with Critical Infrastructure, to provide for definitions, to provide for penalties, to amend Code Section 35-2-36, 42-8-35.4, and 43-34-10 of the official code of Georgia Annotated, relating to composition of battalion, rank of battalion personnel, employment of recruits, or cadets by commissioner. The committee on the Senate on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute respectfully submitted Senator Strickland of the 17th District Chairman. Senate Judiciary offers the following substitute to House Bill 227. A bill to be titled an act to amend Code Section 10-1-359.3 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to forfeiture and items declared contraband, so as to provide for a conforming cross-reference to amend Title 16 of the official code of Georgia annotated, willing to crimes and offenses so as to revise the definition of critical infrastructure. That completes the order, Mr. President. Recognize as Senator from the 46th Distinguished Regulation Industries Chairman. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is a bill to protect attacks on our critical infrastructure of our state. We have defined in the existing code section for criminal damage to property a vital public service, and that will include water systems, sewerage, drainage, energy, the electric grid, natural gas, telecommunications, internet, public transportation systems, all of these public services. We have in the last few years seen a dramatic increase in attacks on power substations and other public services like this, that harm all of us large groups of people at the time. So this makes it clear what are vital public services. It also includes electronic means if you're hacking into these systems rather than just a physical attack. And the trigger is that it increases the minimum punishment from one year to two years, and the maximum punishment from 10 years to 20 years. Mr. President, if there are no questions I'll yield the well, I would ask for your favorable consideration. You do have one question, Senator. Senator from the fort? No, okay. Never mind, you don't have a question, you don't speak for it. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. Senator has yielded the well. I recognize as Senator from the 14th to speak to the bill. Good morning, colleagues. Don't want to take too much of your time. I support the bill, I am going to vote yes, but I just want to put a little marker here for you because 99.9% of the time when we have a social problem that we want to make go away, our first reflex instinct is just to turn the knob up on punishment sentences, that sort of thing. I don't think we have any evidence. I mean, I could be wrong, and I'll take a question if somebody's got evidence. We have any evidence that increasing the penalty is actually going to deter this misconduct. I've heard very limited circumstances. In some cases where they're like said this from the well before, where individuals commit crimes, use message boards and ways of communicating with each other in a network to talk about sentence exposure so that there's actually a real deterrent effect. But we do this a lot of times somewhat mindlessly, and with all respect, I don't mean that the bill is mindless. I just mean that this is our first instinct to always ratchet up punishments. I just wanted to flag that for everybody that, you know, it's something that if we are going to do it, I hope that we're thinking critically about whether we get a real deterrent effect out of it or not. Mr. President, I'll yield for any questions. You do have one question, Senator. Senator from the 46. I'll send it to you. I sure do. So, I understand your concerns, and I share those concerns on many of these bills. We just increase the penalties. Would you agree, though, that it is prudent for us to define these vital public services to make it clear that that falls under these series of property crimes? I agree that there's a lot of utility in that, Senator, and I think these are some of the most important assets that a society, a functioning society has. And so we are meaning well to protect them, but again, you know, I just would like to put a little footnote for everybody as we keep serving year after year. Let's at least try to think creatively about administrative solutions to these problems. First, like for example, catalytic converges is a great example. We've got great administrative remedies that don't necessarily rely on increasing criminal penalties to try and stop the harm. I would love to brainstorm with everybody about those types of administrative solutions before we get to this sort of last resort hammer of increasing the scope of the criminal justice system, but I think all the centers concerns are well taken. Thank you, Senator, and I appreciate your favorable support of this bill. It's always a pleasure to have bipartisan support to protect the people of Georgia. It is, Senator. Thanks. If there are no other questions, I'll give the welcome's president. Yeah, no questions. Does any of the center which speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Question is only adoption of the committee's substitute. Is is there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agree to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The fourth committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of vote. Yay, opposed nay. Secretary, I'm not the machine. You have received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed by substitute. All in the passes of the bill, the yay's are a 52. The nays are a 1. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed by substitute. You Green and shirt right back. SEXARY READ THE CATCHING FOR House�� 2 2 8 House Bill 228, a bill to be entitled an act to amend Code Section 20-3-411 of the official code of Georgia annotated. Letting to definitions regarding tuition, equalization grants at private colleges and universities, so as to expand the definition of upgrouped school. The Committee of the Senate on Higher Education recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully submitted, Senator Hickman of the Fourth District Chairman. We're going to send it here from the 23rd. Thank you, Mr. President. The President, colleagues, I bring you the Senate Substitute to House Bill 228. This is the bill which will enhance our workforce needs by targeting areas of critical responsibility, especially in nursing. What we're doing is expanding the eligibility of universities and colleges, private universities and colleges in Georgia to receive tuition, equalization grant support. These grants have been around since their 70s. They provide only a nominal support level for these students, but it's critical that we expand our definition of these schools that would qualify for TEG. This is a composite bill. There are multiple House bills and our Senate bill, Senate Bill 137 is a part of this, and certainly House Bill 228, Chairman. The MCs bill, you have an amendment in front of you, amendment number one from Senator Anvatarte. This was discussed in committee and was supported, but got stripped at the last minute. I find this will be a friendly amendment and welcome your support for both the bill, as well as the amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. There are no questions. You do have a question, Senator. Senator from the 30th, you wish we speak. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator Gile? Absolutely. I think I've got to work out my mind, but I just want to be sure. On lines 54 and 55, you say since before January 1st, 2021. Yes. And then on lines 79, you say for the last five years, is that different? The five years is the timeframe that the school will have to be a resident or an institution that has been resided in Georgia prior to 2021. And the accreditation situation, the sacks accrediting in particular, it's a five-year program just to receive accreditation. So we feel comfortable that these institutions will have been in the state for more than five years. Thank you for that clarification. There are no further questions. I'll yield a while. You know further, oh, I'm sorry, Senator. You do, you do. I apologize. Senator from 36. You always can yield a little bit. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the Senator you? Yes. Can I go to the Senator? The I was looking at the amendment and it is, if I'm not mistaken, it mandates public schools and school systems to administer yet another test.

Is that that maybe you can walk us through that so that's a little I would defer to the author of the amendment But I would suggest to you that this is an opportunity for our high school students to determine whether or not they have a particular aptitude for military service and A further question for you. It looks like on 15 and 16 that The schools and school system shall select an administer to public school students Those who choose to participate in this Battery assessment I'm sorry you're speaking to the amendment. Is that correct? That's right and I would defer to the author of the amendment Although I support the amendment so then he'll possibly take the well and Thank you. Thank you. Are you a Miss president senator has yielded Do STs work, or working on the amendment Mr. Leader did you have a poly graduate inquiry sir I'd do pardon period in clarency the senator from the 21st was concerned about the lack of progress in the house only passing like ten. The senator knows what he speaks isn't it further true that they can only count to ten at a time they have to start back at zero. Well that's a very very very intriguing note notice right there senator you could be I think you know what you speak. I'm told it's part of their common core math it's in some of the curriculum in Georgia. Do ten the things ten at a time. That's right. All right thank you senator I appreciate you pointing that out. Secretary read the substitute and then the amendment. The senate committee on higher education offers a following substitute to house bill 228. A bill to be entitled an act to amend title 20 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to education so as to expand the definition of approved school as pertaining to tuition equalization grants at private colleges and universities. Senator Anna Vittartte of the 31st and others offers the following amendment. Amend the senate committee on higher education substitute to house bill 228 by replacing line three with the following. Private colleges and universities to require the administration of a nationally recognized multiple aptitude battery assessment that measures developed abilities and helps predict future academic and occupational success in the military to public school students and grades 11 and 12 who choose to participate. Back completes the order Mr. President. I recognize a senator from the 15th or is it 31st? It has amendment 31st. I recognize senator 31st speak to the amendment. Thank you Mr. President. The amendment in front of you was a request that came over from the Department of Defense from General Cardin. And basically this amendment simply is allowing as many of us are familiar with the ASFAB test for the military to be allowed to be completed on school campuses and will not be administered by local school districts. In many cases like we've served in the military or friends or kids wanting to go into the military usually it's the military the Department of Defense who comes on the school campus in a minister's test. I think that Mr. President I'll answer any questions. You do have a couple questions senator senator from the 27th. Thank you Mr. President Chairman you yield. Yes senator. Is it not true that there was a bill floating around the capital that would require the administration of the ACT and SAT. And when I first read this I thought that's what you were doing but you clarified for me that this is the military test. The ACT and SAT would not qualify based on the language occupational success in the military in line 17 and 18. Yes senator that's correct this bill has nothing to do with that. Also this bill requires no state funding. It's all paid for by the military and the federal government. One more question if you don't like this. Is it true also that in line 16 the words choose to participate. Clarifies this would be optional for students and while the schools will be required to administer the test that's paid for by the military as you mentioned that the students would not be required to participate if they didn't want to. That's correct senator there's no forced mandate on the students all this is asking that local school districts just provide the space for the military to provide this test on campus. Thank you. Senator from 36. Thank you Mr. President. Senator you. Yes ma'am. We've had some backing forth exchanges I think that clarify the voluntary nature of this and that the as I understood in a conversation with one of our veterans Senate members. Veteran senator and veteran in the U.S. Army that the Department of Defense, our State Department is a state Department of Defense that's conducting the. It's I mean they're basically all wrapped into one so whether it's the state federal. Right especially it's the Army Navy Marines Coast Guard. We need the senator from the seventh that come up here and she can go through this with us too. She knows all the military branches. She's not paying attention. Well yeah she does and we've already heard her meant recited eloquently and my question was just clarifying the information that I got that the Department of Defense. As you said requested it but also they the cost of any testing is absorbed by them. That's correct. That's correct. Thank you for the question. Good question. There's no further question. Thank you Mr. President you're the one. Does any other senator which speak for against measure. Chair hear your none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered.
