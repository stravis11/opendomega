TRANSCRIPT
----------
Representative Donahue, we'll call.
We'll recognize Representative Barry first.
Here he comes.
Take your time.
You're right.
You got some friends going to come with you?
Friends are invited as well.
If you will give the gentleman in the well and his friends,
your attention, please, is recognition of a birthday today.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today we honor the life and legacy of a great
more-house man and resident of District 56, the Reverend Dr. Martin King Jr., who
understood best that to do justice means to love your fellow man. It means
recognizing that our destinies are tied together, that injustice anywhere truly
is a threat to justice everywhere. He taught us that justice is not abstract. It
It is lived out in our laws, our budgets, and the choices we make when no one is watching.
To love mercy, as our King showed us, is to see the humanity in those society too often
cast aside.
It is to meet punishment with rehabilitation, poverty with opportunity, and in difference
with compassion.
Mercy does not mean the absence of accountability.
It means understanding that every person is worthy of dignity and a chance to be made
whole.
And to walk humbly with your God is to remember that leadership is not about power but about
service.
Dr. King walked humbly even as he shook foundations of this very nation.
He did not seek applause or comfort.
He sought righteousness.
He reminded us that the moral progress requires courage and that silence in the face of
injustice is itself a choice.
As lawmakers, we sit in the seats of immense responsibility.
The bills we pass and the votes we cast shape the lives of families we may never meet.
On this day, honor Dr. King is not about quoting his words, it's about continuing his work.
So my charge to his body is simple on this weekend that we celebrate him.
Let us legislate with justice as our guide, mercy as our posture, and humility as our compass.
Let us ensure that he will laws this state, been not towards convenience, but towards justice.
And that is how we honor Dr. King, not just today,
but every day we are entrusted with the power to serve.
Let us take a moment to silence our own
and the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Mark
from the King of Junior.
Thank you.
