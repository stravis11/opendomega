If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed?
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 99th House District,
Representative Matt Rees, Representative Rees.
Thank you, Speaker Byrne and good morning, House colleagues.
I'm proud to introduce you, Pastor Chuck Allen of Sugar Hill Church in Gwinnett County
who's joined this morning by his wonderful wife Jenny who's there on the front row.
Pastor Chuck serves as a Gwinnett County police chaplain as well as on the Gwinnett County
school superintendents business leaders council.
He is the head pastor of Sugar Hill Church which has about 6,000 members and is very active
in a lot of areas of life in Gwinnett County.
a pastor is his second career. He was a builder and developer before going into the ministry.
And his church is engaged in a lot of things such as leading the meals on wheels, program
and our part of Gwinnett County, and also a mental health ministry called Clear Path Counseling
Network. And he also has a podcast, a regular podcast called The Positive Talk Podcast
and Lord knows we need more positive talk in this day and age. Sugar Hill Church actively
supports good work in the Lanier High School area in Gwinnett County and the last time
I visited his church, one of the people leading worship, they recognized him for celebrating
Cinco no Drinco, five years being clean and sober and so he is fighting addiction successfully
and openly through the good news in Gwinnett County.
So since we have a three day weekend, we're celebrating Martin Luther King Day on Monday
and a presidential inauguration and unfortunately a national championship that we might not be
all as excited about. He's going to give us some inspiring words to get us through a three-day weekend.
Pastor Chuck Allen.
Thanks so much for the privilege to be with you today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
Legislatures, my friend and representative Matt Reeves. Kind of like Elizabeth Taylor,
I told one of her husbands, don't worry, I won't keep you long.
I do bring you greetings from Gwinnett County in Sugarhill, Georgia, and it's good to be
back in this house.
It's been several years since I've done this, but it's a great joy and honor.
My daddy was a state representative, a state senator, and another state.
And so it's a privilege for me to be back in a place I'm comfortable with.
My encouragement to you this morning comes from Galatians chapter 6, verse 9.
says, let us not grow weary in doing good for induced season will reap if we don't give up.
I imagine the joys of elected office can rapidly disintegrate into the lonely leadership
frustratingly challenging divisiveness and strain. My guess is I told Mr. Speaker earlier,
you guys are about like me, we're seen in the same esteem in the public. Preachers,
insurance salesmen use car salesmen and well politicians and yet this
country and this great state needs you more than ever we need women and men of
character and decency and strength and the ability to say this is right this is
wrong and let's go do what's right the possible Paul could have been speaking
in these hollered halls in this very capital when he said to the Philippians in
Chapter 3, let's forget what is behind us and reach forward to what's ahead, because
I am one of those folks who have lived in the great state of Georgia since 1972, and I'm
absolutely certain our best days are ahead of us in the right here right now, and much
of that is because of you.
Thank you for all that you do.
I'll leave you with this last word before we pray and pledge, I'd give you this word,
which is the Chuck Yeager speech, which I give a bunch of young preachers all the time
when I speak to them in 1947, they sent these group a young hotshot
preacher or pilots down to the desert southwest of America.
They were about to try and break the soundbearer flying parallel to the ground.
They put them in these stubby wing little rocket ships and every time they
would approach what we now know as Mach 1, the turbulence in that ship would be
so severe, they only had one of three opportunities.
They could pull back on the throttle and land safely and everything was good
except for one thing that didn't accomplish the mission
for which they were tasked.
They had another option they could leave it like it was
and everything would be just fine except those were the pilots
that crashed and burned because the assumption was
it would just work out.
You know, I think we've learned it does not just work out.
And on this fateful day in 1947, Chuck Yeager pushed
the throttle forward.
And the ground crew hooded for the first time
that sonic boom from a plane.
And after that crash and that boom,
there were seconds because of breaking the sound barrier,
they heard nothing on the radio,
and they hung their heads and fought themselves.
We've lost another pilot, we've lost another ship.
A few seconds later, they heard these words over the radio,
you won't believe how smooth it is on the other side.
And my encouragement to you legislators
is to know this, this great state
and this great nation needs you more than ever, keep going.
The work that you do matters.
And like the Apostle Paul said,
forget what is behind you and press on
toward those things that matter most.
You are men and women that this state
and people like me count on.
And on behalf of the great people of Gwyneth County
and Sugar Hill, Georgia, thank you for all that you do.
Mr. Speaker, thank you for this privilege.
Would you join me as we pray?
God of all creation, thank you.
In your creation and for these men and women
and these leaders.
Give this speaker and give these legislators wisdom
from on high.
Give them the ability to make choices that are well
establishing grounded in principles that matter.
Give them caretz or indecency and kindness and graciousness.
Give them boldness to stand for those things which
matter most and protect the great state of Georgia
in this great land.
We thank you and praise you for this day.
I pray we'd act and lead in a way in which you are pleased.
And you can look at your creation and say,
those are my men, those are my women, and I am so proud.
Thank you for this day.
And Jesus, name we pray.
Amen.
Would you join me as we salute to the flag of the United States
of America and to the Republic for which it stands,
one nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
God bless you, going peace.
Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, members join the pastor in the South
at any room for a photo and thank them for being here.
Our Doctor of the Day today is brought to us by the gentleman from the 127th House District.

Audits, Chairman Hilton, give the gentleman your attention please.

Representative Sanchez, you recognize for a morning order, give the gentleman your
attention please, and friends represent Sanchez. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We are here
today to honor a life of an important environmental activist who dedicated their life to protecting
nature.
Manuel Esteban Baez Deban was someone who dedicated their life to helping our communities thrive
and make sure we have a sustainable future.
Objectly, tomorrow, January 18th, 2025, will be the second anniversary of Manuel's killing.
Killed when peacefully protesting for the environment and against tearing down our forests right
here in Atlanta.
They were shot 57 times.
Manuel is 26 years old.
The killing of Manuel, an environmental activist, was a horrific and unprecedented injustice.
But with Manuel's tragic death, they left behind their family, including their mother,
Reverend Belguista-Don, and their brother, Pedro de Don, who are up in the gallery with us
this morning, along with fellow friends and colleagues.
If you would please stand, I want to recognize you all, and especially want to recognize
Manuel's mother, Reverend Belguista-Don.
Despite such a tragic loss, she has dedicated her life to continuing Manuel's legacy of
protecting the forest, planting trees, and doing what we can to help preserve our greatest
gift on this earth, Mother Nature.
She has even started a nature-based healing center to heal those in the community and
honor of Manuel.
So please join me in welcoming Reverend Belkis Dharan,
the Dharan family and friends to honor a life
and legacy of Manuel Dharan and let us remember Manuel
to continue their fight for justice, peace,
and the preservation of our environment.
Please join me in a moment of silence.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative.
Representative Park Cannon is recognized for a morning order, and she has a number of
friends joining her for a special morning order to honor a former senator and
a member of this general assembly. So I'll ask as a to honor this former
senators that support, I'll ask y'all I'll just stand as represented canon.
Recognizes his memory. Representative canon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good
morning members, I stand today to end this first legislative week of just honoring the
life of Senator Vincent Fort who served for over 15 years to be an elected official who
care deeply about working families and who would bend over backwards to make sure that
folks had access to fair housing.
He was actually successful in passing our strongest state predatory lending law, which
allowed for us to move up out of the category
of the most predatory zip code in the country.
And his family is here with us today.
I'd like to ask for his son, Zand, to stand.
And for us to, at this time, really let
you know the importance of your father
will continue to live on through the legacy
that we push here at the state capital.
I'd like to also recognize his chief of staff
for many years, Javier Brown, as well as the individuals
who helped him to pass these laws, Ms. Vanessa Manley,
Dr. Angela Brown.
I just want to thank y'all for coming out today
and putting on a beautiful ceremony for him
on January 3rd, as well as January 4th.
He is now resting at the Southeast Cemetery,
so please do go and visit him.
And we do also have his program here with us today,
and would just ask if you're interested
in signing the program, it will go to the family.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Kennan.
Thank you, family, for being here.
Senator Ford did a lot of good work here.
We appreciate it.

That completes the reading with privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting the privileged resolutions that chair here's done and the
resolutions are adopted?
We're going to have some afternoon orders.
So if you've signed up for an afternoon order, you need to get ready to bring us your afternoon
in order.
I'm going to recognize Representative Brad Thomas.
So here's our posture, we're, we typically have, are going to allow, allow 10 minutes for
afternoon orders.
We have a number of y'all signed up, but since we are nearing the end of the day and
we've done pretty good on our timing this morning, instead of having a minute, minute
and a half, allowing all members, they want to make an afternoon order, two minutes, you
will.
Okay.

And she's going to have a photo up.
Representative Shelley Hutchison, welcome to the well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I want to talk to you about the Social Empowerment
Center.
It's also in my district.
They are the mental health providers
before, during, and after the Appalachia High School
shooting.
It also happens to be the agency that I started 22 years ago.
When my staff called me that morning, all schools in Barrow were under lockdown.
I have one staff member that was in her office for six hours with her desk barricaded
against the door.
The stories that we're getting from these kids will never go away.
The only thing we can do is help them cope.
And right now, I want to recognize my staff who I'm incredibly proud of, who makes me
proud every single day.
That's just a few of them.
We have about 100 employees that do in-home mental health services in Gwinnett, Barrow,
Athens, Stevens, Banks.
We go in Northeast Georgia.
No other providers go.
But I wanted to recognize this staff who continues to work at Appalachia High School.
continues to work with the families who lost people.
And the kids' stories, oh, they had to triage their teachers.
We'll never go away.
So if we can give a hand around the plus
to the heroes of Appalachia High School,
my staff at the Social Empowerment Center, I'd appreciate it.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield a well.
Thank you, Representative, for all of your work.
We appreciate you and your staff.
Representative Odinya is recognized for an afternoon order.
You have the will, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues.
Today, we are celebrating Martin Luther King.
We have a celebration service that we take in place at 10 a.m. at the North Wing steps.
You are all invited to be there.
The governor, the speaker will also be there.
And most importantly, we are going to be there because we're going to remember the memory
of such a person that has impacted all our lives.
saying that I cherish a lot and I'd like to mention,
life's most persistent and urgent question.
What are you doing for others?
And that is a quote that I've lived by.
What are we doing for others?
Mr. Speaker, thank you.
See you all there.
Thank you, sir, for the announcement.
1030 downstairs were doing the governor to celebrate
the memory of Martin Luther King.
Representative Charley Spurs recognized for an afternoon order in the morning
and friends.
Yesterday what I witnessed outside those doors marks a dark and troubling moment.
The arrest of the senator from the 53rd following his ban from entering the House chamber
after making a statement that was met with disapproval,
strikes at the heart of our democratic principles.
This unprecedented action undermines the integrity
of our legislative process and sets a dangerous
and unconstitutional precedent when a duly elected member
of the General Assembly is barred from fulfilling his duties.
When differences of opinion lead to exclusion and arrest,
rather than open dialogue, we erode the very foundation
of our republic.
This is about more than one individual.
It is about protecting the principles
of representative democracy and ensuring
that every voice elected to this body
has the opportunity to be heard.
Let us reflect on the gravity of this moment and commit ourselves to upholding the rights
and freedoms that define us as a station, as a state, and a nation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative.
Repturement Weed Hour is recognized for an afternoon order, representing Marcus Weed
Hours, recognized.
Good morning, colleagues, afternoon order, I guess.
I don't know how many of you got asked this question when you got elected for the first
time, but the moment I got elected, somebody asked me what I was running for next.
So that happened to you, right?
Well guess what?
I'm not going anywhere.
I love this house, I love this chamber, all of the family that we create, certain individuals
back in the back, and I'll have to say names, but you know who you are from the other
party that I've been become great friends with in this chamber, okay?
We elect somebody to control this room to make sure we have decorum in this room and
honor in this room, right?
There are proper ways to handle things and there are improper ways to handle things.
Some it'll be debated probably for a long time what happened yesterday.
Right wrong was it handled correctly, okay?
Let me tell you something, certain people use this as theater, certain people plan things
to be able to raise money.
They play on people's emotions, they play on what people want to hear at home because
they think that's going to get them to their next step.
I'm not here for that.
The man that I elected to control his chamber is not here for that.
Debate what happened yesterday all you want, call it what you want to call it, okay?
But I'm going to stand here for the truth.
I'm going to stand here for the district of 121 that I represent so proudly.
I'm going to stand here for you, my friends, my family.
and I'm proud to be run to this chamber to be run
the way it is running.
Thanks, Conclude.
Thank you.
Representative James Burchett is recognized
for a afternoon order in the morning.
Representative Burchett.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, colleagues.
Thank you, Chairman Weed Hour.
I appreciate your words.
I also want to come back up here and just say hello and welcome to the session for 2025.
It started off with the bang.
I want you guys to have a good weekend, but I want to center us back to what we're here to do.
and that's to govern the state of Georgia.
And I want to reflect on something
that another one of our colleagues just came up
and reflected on in Representative Hutchinson.
In the state of the state yesterday,
the governor mentioned one of his priorities
as being education and funding our schools
to harden our schools and assure that what happened
in Appalachia does not happen again.
And I am happy that Representative Hutchinson
is in support and I hope everybody in this chamber will be in support and I think that we are.
I think this is one area that we have been able to rally behind each other in that we can protect
our children and I want to end today on a light note and say that I appreciate each and every one
of you all here. I hope you have a great and grand and lovely three-day weekend because I think we
We need it already, and I hope to see you all back on Monday.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You're coming on Monday.
You're going to be by yourself, but you come on.
I'm coming on Tuesday.
That concludes our afternoon orders in the morning so we'll move on to announcements
for this time.
Representative Gamble, he may have had to escort his, oh there he comes, Representative
Gamble.
Representative Mac Gamble.
You have the wells, sir, and friends.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm joined by Representative Neal,
and we are the co-chairs for the Japan Caucus.
And so we want to invite everyone to Japan Day on Tuesday,
the 21st, from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. here in the capital
on the South Steps.
They'll be set up, and they'll have many companies
from Japan, our consulate from Japan,
who is based here in Atlanta.
will be here as well.
There's also a reception later that evening.
You have the information on your desk
and we wanted to invite all members,
Representative Neil, would you like to say anything?
Just want to say thank you so much.
We are so happy to represent you all
on the Georgia Davanese Council
and we look forward to seeing you next week.
And then one other quick thing, Mr. Speaker,
a rad day for the addiction and recovery
is also on Tuesday.
So if you have been involved
the working group on addiction recovery and the Jeff breed love and the Georgia Council
on recovery. They will also be here on Tuesday in the Capitol and I encourage y'all to come
and be involved with those festivities as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thanks to both of y'all for those announcements. Representative Nigo, you kind of just kind
of wove your way in there on that, didn't you? But that's fine. So I encourage y'all of you
since there won't probably won't be a large crowd here from the this house. If you're
here, make sure you make a special effort to attend and
greet these folks and learn more.
Representative Gaines, us here from you, you have an
announcement.
You're not playing football Monday, but you got to have an
announcement.
Unfortunately not.
I wish we were going to be in Mercedes-Benz on Monday, but
Chairman Hatch had asked me to make an announcement to remind
everyone that appropriations hearings are next week.
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and if you haven't already, budget
are ready in 412 CLOB. So just a reminder, look forward to seeing everybody next week.
There, you're going to be working hard there for Chairman Hatchett,
carrying his award. I can tell you what, he'll put you to work.
While we're on that subject for our Recognized Representative Camp,
correct me there, Mr. Chairman and Vice Chair. Members not on your committee can receive a
per diem next week if they attend the meetings, is that correct?
In person, even if you aren't on appropriations, you will receive a per diem if you come
and attend the meetings in person next week.
If there's any change from that because of the weather, you will be notified, this house
will be notified.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Journal of the camp is recognized for announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You probably got an email from me regarding delegation rules, and also there's information
on your desk regarding delegation rules.
This is an important thing because this will set the tone for your delegation for the
next two years.
You've got two weeks to do it, so please meet with your house delegation and establish
delegation rules.
If you are the only person in your county, then you have established a role, you have one.
So that's easy enough.
But if you have multiple people, please sit down with your fellow house members and have
a discussion on how you will handle local legislation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
You do a great job respecting the members of this House and chair in the committee.
So thanks for continuing to encourage them to communicate with you.
Thank you.
Oh, that completes our business for the day.
Now listen up, birthdays.
We won't be here obviously next week to celebrate birthdays.
So I'm going to call some birthdays out.
I'm not going to tell your age, but I ask you to stand
because we have a number of you.
And then we're going to celebrate with you all at one time
here in just a moment.
So when I call your name, if you'll stand,
That would be appropriate.
First one's already standing.
