TRANSCRIPT
----------
If anybody's out there in the hall, if you'd come on back in, we have our members on the
It's still outside.
Okay.
Patients.
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to put the sub before us and then I have a proposed
amendment and then I'd like us to have the discussion we need to have and then take
a vote. So we've got a substitute before you which is LC 49238 to ECS. Do I hear a motion
do pass on the substitute, motion in a second, and now as far as amendments go, the chair
would like to entertain a motion to make two changes to the substitute. One of them
online 267, which is on page 11, I believe,
to add, after the word, services,
to add the words related to the litigation,
to narrow the scope of that prohibition,
because some of the companies that do this kind of stuff
also provide financial services that would not
impact the litigation necessarily.
I'm sorry, it related to the litigation right after the word services on line 267.
And then the other one, which we can refer to as the Evans and Sally amendment, is to
strike the word regulated on line 384.
All right, so we have striking regulated on 384 and adding related to the litigation after
the word services on 267. Do I hear a motion to make that amendment? Do I have a second?
I have a motion to second. Any discussion about the amendments or the substitute?
Hearing none, I'll call the question on the amendment first and then we vote on the bill
as amended. I know you've got my little script here but I wanted to confirm it.
Okay, so I was reading something wrong.
All right, so we've got a motion to amend on the floor with a second.
I don't think there's any further discussion.
All those in favor of the motion to amend the bill, signify by saying aye.
Those opposed say no, all right, the ayes have it.
And so the bill, the substitute is amended.
Now all those in favor of recommending do pass to the substitute as amended.
Would you signify by saying aye?
Aye.
All those opposed?
I do apologize, I was reading as you were moving swiftly, I did want to propose one small
amendment for the committee, the subcommittees consideration, it is online 274 of the Substitute,
a litigation financing agreement, shall, my proposal based on some of the discussion
I had and what I've sort of already said on the record.
I propose shall be changed to May.
Okay.
I think the chairman understands why, but I will just say it for the benefit of my colleagues.
I think that if a litigation financier does everything he or she is supposed to do under
this bill and let's say a legal representative based on that legal representative's conduct
unrelated to the financier could be held responsible for decisions
in the litigation when they are at the same time prohibited from participating in the
litigation. So I think that is a sort of contradictory in this code and more importantly I think
it would discourage good litigation financing companies who do everything that they're
supposed to do from engaging in this endeavor which does as we've already discussed provide
benefit to plaintiffs, when done correctly, plaintiffs who need assistance bringing their
claim. So I would ask the chairman to consider changing shall to may.
I think we had, we discussed that issue and the chair tried to offer a contrary position
but I will allow that motion. So if you want to make that motion.
All right, is there a second all right is there any discussion right all those in favor so you can find by saying aye
All those opposed say no
Let's have a show of hands those in favor raise your hand
Help me do my siphon it's for all those opposed
Like the motion fails. Great. Okay. All right. So there any other motions
All right, so we've got the motion to pass the bill as amended with the, I'll just collectively refer to that as the
assalignment and the motion and second of our inmates there on the floor, all those in favor of passing the bill as amended in that manner.
So you can find by saying aye.
All those opposed, say no.
No.
No, we had one no.
I think the chair says the motion passes.
And so we will recommend do pass to the full rules committee on that substitute as amended and that ladies and gentlemen
I believe concludes our business for this evening
So thank you all and hopefully that will conclude our business as a subcommittee
I just want to thank all the committee members for your service and want to thank all the folks who attended so
patiently throughout the hearing so thank you and we're adjourned
