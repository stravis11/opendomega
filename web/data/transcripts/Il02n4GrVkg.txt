Good morning, Georgia Senate.
I have the honor to introduce one of our beloved families from the 31st Senate District,
Reverend Britt Madden.
Reverend Britt Madden is a long life resident of Poe County, where his family has resided on the family farm
for three and soon to be four generations.
Brett is the pastor of Cedar Town,
first United Methodist in Cedar Town, Georgia,
which is also the church he grew up in
and started his relationship with Jesus Christ.
His family, including his wife of 17 years,
Amy, she's here, along with his two daughters,
eight year old Anna and six year old Lily,
who were here today to show their love for him.
While being a pastor, Brett has served his congregation
over 24 years with 24 years of experience in the pulpit.
The 22 years was where he served
as a bi-vocational pastor and congregations
all over West Georgia.
He also worked with his father in the accounting
and tax evaluation practice, which pastor Matt
and I will tell you, you may have to come back up here.
We're eliminating the income tax,
so maybe you can help us do that.
And also too, bread has been a leader
in the education space where he just served his eighth year
on the Polk County School Board
and recently just ended his term
as the chair of the Board of Education.
With that, I'll introduce to you, Reverend Madden.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator Anvatarte,
for this wonderful opportunity.
And I say to the room, good morning.
Good morning.
I bring you greetings and glad tidings,
this pastor of the wonderful congregation in Cedar Town,
Georgia's Cedar Town First Methodist Church.
And I also put those same greetings
are extended from our God who is with us on days.
I tell you that it rains and on days
fill a glorious sunshine in whom loves us
with a love that desires us and moves him to seek us.
to seek us. I share with you this morning of two stories, rooted with strong ties to
the God talked about by the Psalmist in Psalm 29. The first story goes back to the
1960s and as I look across the room a few of you definitely remember that time.
But there was a moment that I want you to know that occurred that really struck me.
It was a moment when Admiral Harmon Rickover gave then President John F. Kennedy a small
brass plaque and it was engraved with a prayer.
Kennedy liked it an awful awful lot and he used it actually at the dedication of a memorial
to the people who were lost missing at sea.
And the prayer on that memorial actually said, oh God, thy sea is so great and my boat
is so small.
And as I've had the short opportunity to stand before you this morning and look across
the wonderful representatives in this room who go and represent communities from all around
this state.
And as I look around and see you this morning, as you populate these beautiful tables that
are historic in nature, I see, too, that you are in a boat just pretty small.
But not as small, though it was a life raft of a man by the name of Alex Friedman, whose
story was actually published in the Atlantic just a few months ago. The first
time commercial fisherman, this is his first run after going through the
Coast Guard Loot Course they sent you to local community college where he got
on a boat for the first time to try to be a commercial fisherman. Well the first
time he went out with another captain on just him in the boat off the
Washington State Coast a massive storm came in and he found himself in a
life raft, no bigger than a kiddie pool with a tent on top of it.
Mr. Friedman with limited supplies, he went through an overdeal and saw him go through
all types of emotions of which the psalmist in that 29th psalm reminded us of throughout.
He pleaded aloud for God, Friedman did, to save his physical self while all the while
the battering of waves were occurring on that little kitty poo. After a few days, he then
started apologizing to God for every past transgression, for every injustice. He admitted
allowed to break in the Ten Commandments, and he simply just asked his God, our God, for forgiveness.
And I pause this story at this very moment for you to think for yourself.
A moment just to ask your own self, what would you do if you were lost at sea?
Now, that phrase lost at sea can be replaced as what would be more relevant to you.
I can only imagine sitting where you sit.
The questions where you might be lost at your proverbial sea when you're trying to figure
out how this bill, this before you, helps people the best.
Or maybe the question can come about, am I voting the vote based on helping my people in
in my district or am I voting on helping the people
who just simply elected me.
Let's go back to the story though of Mr. Alec Friedman.
After resolving in his own mind that he was going to die,
he shared to the writer of the article
that he didn't fall into despair,
but he found and he made an incredible statement
and I quoted for you this morning.
He said, he found a piece I hadn't known to look for, and it found me.
Peace my friends found him, because you see when we're lost at sea overwhelmed by the
chaos of life, God finds us and gives us peace.
the very next morning. I like woke up and saw a boat and it was getting closer. He
hollered out and with his last flair lit and burning in his own hand. He was
crying out. And then he heard a voice from that very same boat that he saw was
coming toward him. And the voice from the boat said, we see you. We're coming. We
We see you.
The promise of Scripture, my friends, is that God has power over the watery chaos of
life.
When we are confused or perplexed, I will share with you the comforting news that God is
searching for us.
When we are feeling lost, when we are feeling bewildered, disoriented, God hears your
prayers. When we are facing the most complex of situations, and I know this room can put
out some bills that look pretty complex. But I tell you this, my friend's God offers
us peace. Let us pray.
Oh, wonder's God. I thank you for this opportunity to be in this place. Oh,
loving God, I tell you, it's amazing. The historical significance from which I
stand in this very moment, but you know all about it. And Lord, you know about
everyone in this room and you know the sea that they're traveling on right
now. And some of them might think the area is just nothing to see at all from
my little boat. But oh God, help them realize that they aren't alone. We aren't alone and
help us to realize, oh Heavenly Father, that is your love and your grace that searches
for us. And we are so, so thankful. I pray that when we are found, bless this room, bless
the work of this body and bless us all. In your glorious name I pray. Amen.

We have a doctor of the day we need to recognize and always appreciate our physicians coming down here and volunteer in their time, and to introduce our doctor of the day, I call on the senator from the 38th.
I'm going to get that down at one point and four so with it and that right senator from the 41st
Center from 38
Good morning colleagues. I am honored to welcome back to the chamber our doctor of the day from
Senate district 38
Dr. Kelly grat de Grafen Reed who is a physician program director of appointment
excellent and auxiliary access for Kaiser Permanente of Georgia.
She is a specialist in adult medicine who believes that our bodies, minds, and relationships
all have an effect on our health and encourages our patients to take time to celebrate their lives.
Dr. DeGraffnery is a native of Indiana, so I'm sure is happy about what's going to happen here next week.
She is a graduate of Purdue University with a pharmacy degree, and then she went on to complete her medical degree at Case Western University, which is in Ohio, and her residency here at Emory University.
She is also very active in the Medical Association of Georgia as President of the Medical Institute of Excellence in Medicine and former Task Force Chairperson, and is one of the board, is on the board of the Medical Association of Atlanta.
so I am very honored to welcome back to the chamber,
Dr. Kelly DeGraffin-Ree.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You've been on my TV lately.
I don't know.
It's about commercials.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
I also want to thank the Medical Association of Georgia
for providing an opportunity for me to hang out
with Ms. Julia today and provide what I believe
as part of my civil service.
I'd also like to give a shout out to the Medical Association of Atlanta, who supported me in doing this new program for me called Georgia Physicians Leadership Association,
which there are over 200 plus graduates, where our physicians who are really interested in doing this work of creating policy for the state of Georgia.
Quickly, I'm reminded of two things,
as a permanent take physician,
our medical director reminds us
that we live in a vuka world,
volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.
I know you all know a little bit about that.
And physicians are uniquely trained
for this vuka environment.
We deal with it every day in the exam rooms
as we deliver health care.
I was also raised by my grandma,
so I'm reminded of something she said
that it takes all kinds.
and our physician training teaches us
that we need different specialties.
We need different support with nurses,
pharmacists, associate practitioners.
And so I want to say that we physicians
are happy to join you guys as you serve
the citizens of Georgia and creating policy.
You'll see us in force on February 4th
at Physicians Day of the Capitol,
but we want to offer us as resources to you all
to help as you're creating this policy.
So again, thank you to all of you for all that you do.
My fellow colleagues in the profession,
Dr. Karpaktrick and Dr. Watson appreciate you
allowing me to be here to serve you today.
Let me know if there's any other way I can serve you.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You did a good job.
You did a good job.
You did a good job.
Oh, let me turn this thing.
Are there any unanimous concerns?
all right any Senator which rise on the point of personal privilege we're gonna
Senator from the 40th.
Fellow senators, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor the life of a remarkable woman,
constituent, a supporter, and a friend, and Eisenhower, and her beloved son, Max Potowitz.
Ann was a highly respected public relations professional, trusted by journalists,
admired by colleagues, and known for her integrity and her generosity. She made time to mentor
young professionals, opening doors, connecting people and lifting others up. What
truly set Anne apart was her heart. She believed deeply in human rights, in
decency, justice, and the power of civic engagement. She lived those values
every day and she taught them to her son Max. Together they worked for causes
reflected their shared compassion and commitment to their community and was
always 200% in, giving her time, her energy and her whole heart. I remember Ann
showing up to one of my meet and greets at my last primary campaign. She didn't
have to. She knew me well already. When I showed her a draft of my final
campaign piece. She took it, she marked it up, and she handed it back to me. Way better
than it had been before. She wore my campaign t-shirt all over the country and sent me pictures
of her in that t-shirt wherever she was. She showcased a four-foot by a-foot campaign banner
in her front yard tied to trees on a very busy Dunwoody intersection. But Anne's greatest
joy was her beloved son Max.
Out long ago Ann wrote, everything I did was for him.
And every moment with him was joy.
Max was a freshman at NYU, full of promise and creativity,
a talented guitarist with a gentle spirit.
He shared many passions with his mother,
including travel and a deep love of bunnies.
Together, Max and Anne were members of the Georgia House
Rabbit Society, bonded by their compassion for small creatures.
Max's life was suddenly a tragically cut short in early December.
The grief Anne carried was simply too profound,
and she could not imagine a path forward without him.
The only way I know how to make sense of this loss
of both Anne and Max is to live by their example.
To remember their love, their generosity,
and their belief in a better tomorrow.
I ask that we as a Senate honor Anne and Max today
and that we all recommit ourselves to the values
that they lived by dignity, justice, and care for one another.
Would you please join me in a moment of silence?
As soon as I ask, everyone stand and join us in a moment of silence.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the well.
Do you have a consent calendar before you a privilege of resolutions does any senator wish remove resolution from the consent calendar?
Chair, is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar?
Chair, here's none, and the resolution on the consent calendars are adopted.
Senator from the 41st, work purposes, do you rise?
I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 39th.
Without objection, the senator from the 39th is excused.
Are there any motions that would draw or commit?
I recognize the majority leader for motion.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I got for my new floor leader from the senator from the 42nds, trying to throw me off over
here.
Yeah, for now until you're going.
I'm Mr. President, I move that the Senate stand adjourn until 10 a.m. Thursday, January 15th.
The majority of the leaders move. Secretary, read the announcements.
There are no announcements, Mr. President.
Majority leader has moved. Recognize the Senate from 24th, what purpose do you rise?
Michael, now.
Come on.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Yesterday I left it on your desk and tomorrow we'd love to have you to come down on the
second floor and let's keep Georgia wild day and see some people from DNR.
We'd love to have you out tomorrow, between 8 and 11.
Thank you.
It's always a good day.
Appreciate you letting everybody know that, Senator.
Recognize the center from the 19th.
You wave.
Once again, I'll let you.
Okay.
All right, your light was on.
Some of your neighbors are playing with you over there, I guess.
All right.
Any other announcements?
Also, remember tomorrow is tomorrow is the state of the state.
So it will be tight on time.
Obviously, we've got to go to the house chamber for that.
So, but just remember, it's more as a say to the state.
So, the majority of the leader has moved that we stand to
adjourn until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
All those of favor the most will stick to five by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
Dye is clearly heavy, you'll have a good day.
