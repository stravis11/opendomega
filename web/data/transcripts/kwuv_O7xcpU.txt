----------
Thank you for being here today. My name is Isabella Tarot. I am the Georgia Policy Director for the SPLC Action Fund.
The SPLC Action Fund is a catalyst for racial justice in the South and beyond.
Working in partnership with communities to dismantle white supremacy, strengthen intersectional movements, and advance human rights for all people.
We are very excited to be here today to announce the launch of our latest report titled Sheltering in Justice.
This report is the result of a year-long collaboration with many of the advocates that you see here today as we call for our state to stop criminalizing people experiencing homelessness, especially those who have been experiencing poverty for a long time.
First, you were here from the author of this report, my colleague Gina Azito Thompson, who is a policy analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Good afternoon. My name is Gina Asido Thompson and I'm SPLC's Eradicating Poverty Policy
Analyst. I'm also the author of our new report Sheltering and Justice, a call for Georgia
to stop criminalizing people experiencing homelessness. I'm honored to be here today
with these esteemed guests to discuss the issue of Georgia's harmful practice of criminalizing
people experiencing homelessness. Housing is a human right in access to safe and stable
housing is essential to a safe and vibrant community, state, and country. Yet the rising
cost of housing and lack of supportive services mean that many across the state, the majority
of whom are people of color, especially black people, are deprived of housing and subsequently
experience homelessness. Importantly, this is an urgent matter, both in Georgia and across
the country. In fact, a recent Harvard report found that more than half of renters could
not afford to pay their rent in 2022. And, because of these harmful laws, people experiencing
homelessness in the Peach State are also subject to constant interactions with law enforcement.
Further compounding the overrepresentation of people of color, both in the criminal legal
system and in those who experience homelessness, the matter before us today.
To understand the human impact of this issue, I want to tell you about someone I met around
four months ago.
I was honored to speak with Miss Sylvia, an 80-year-old black woman experiencing homelessness,
whose story is featured in sheltering injustice.
Miss Sylvia was living in a shelter in Athens, Georgia, but sometimes she'd also sleep outside
using a poncho to cover herself when it rains.
Now Miss Sylvia uses a mobility walker
to assist with her walking.
And while speaking with her, she lifted her dress
to show me her ankles.
They were covered with ulcers,
and she mentioned they were quite painful.
Yet she had walked three hours the night before
to get back to the shelter
because she'd missed her last bus of the night.
To top off the hardship she experienced,
Miss Sylvia has also had to deal with criminalization,
simply because she didn't have access to housing.
She shared with me a story about a time
where she sat down at a shopping center in Athens
to rest after a long day in the hot Georgia sun.
She sat down with a drink to cool off
and was met with law enforcement
handing her a trust pass warning
after she accidentally fell off to sleep.
She said that she still had a year left on her band
before she could return to the shopping center.
In that instance, she was simply sitting and resting,
things that we all have probably done in the past few hours,
but don't have to think about.
Unfortunately, Miss Sylvia's story is not an outlier.
In 2022, over 10,000 Georgians were reported
to be experiencing homelessness across the state
with more than half of those people living unsheltered.
Frankly, with all the resources available
to provide affordable housing,
that number was over 10,000 too many.
In many of Georgia's districts,
the number of people who are living unsheltered
are disproportionately people of color.
For example, between 2017 and 2022,
black people accounted for 28%
of the total population of Athens-Clarke County,
yet 40% of the unsheltered individual population.
What's more is people, like Miss Sylvia,
people experiencing homelessness,
are also disproportionately impacted
in the criminal legal system.
For example, one in eight,
people booked in Atlanta City jail
were experiencing homelessness.
Georgia has a number of laws
that are putting thousands of people
experiencing homelessness at risk of arrest.
In 2023, the Georgia legislature passed Senate Bill 62,
which forces cities and towns to enforce bans on public camping
and punishes people for simply sitting
or sleeping in public places.
Sitting and sleeping are both essential to being human,
to surviving, yet what defines them as legal
is whether a person has housing to perform these activities in.
As we highlight in our new report,
the criminalization of people experiencing homelessness
has a human cost.
Many of the people we interviewed often felt fear, shame,
judgment, and stress during a time where kindness,
rather than criminalization, would have gone a long way.
We should not expose people to further trauma
with the threat of arrests and punishment.
Rather, people experiencing homelessness should be given
the opportunity to choose what's best for them
by providing them with access to resources and housing.
Fortunately, our report sees a path forward.
Specifically, as we outlined in the report, we urge Georgia and its localities to take
the following steps.
Repeal, defund, and stop enforcing current laws that criminalize homelessness and
reform policies that especially impact people with low incomes who are involved with the
legal system, like cash bail and probation fees.
stop sleeping encampments and instead invest in creating pilot programs that allow people
to access quality housing with cash assistance.
And add housing status as a measure of homelessness to the list of protected categories in relevant
anti-discrimination laws.
But first and foremost, Georgia should always begin with speaking and hearing from those
most impacted by its policies, such as those that criminalize people for experiencing
homelessness.
Integrating and censoring people with lived experience in the efforts to prevent criminalization
is crucial to preventing further harm in undoing the damage that criminalization is causing.
That's why I'm so honored today to be joined by Jerry, one of the people with lived experience
that I interviewed to for the report and whose story and vision for the future informed
its policy proposals.
As you'll hear, Jerry is a successful Athens-based entertainer who hasn't let his circumstances
and experiences with homelessness deter the plans for his future and family.
Jerry's experiences underscores the urgent need for reform so that other people don't
have to go through similar situations.
And yet, despite Jerry's experience, he remains warm-hearted.
I'm inspired by Jerry's determination, strength,
and hope for the future.
One where people experiencing homelessness
aren't criminalized and housing truly is accessible for all.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My name is Jerry Hertz.
I'm a resident of Georgia,
and I'm honored to be with you all today
to share my story.
So you can see the human impact of historic and ongoing efforts
to criminalize people experiencing homelessness today.
Look at me today, and success story,
who I have a career as a street entertainer,
also known as busking, and a hobby that I also love and enjoy.
I'm a father of a two-year-old daughter, her name is Journey.
And I've been in my current relationship for over two years now.
And just until recently, I was also experiencing homelessness.
For over nine months, I lived in a hotel
and had not much permanent housing on my own.
But before I was in a hotel, I couched her a little bit,
but I may live outside, sometimes in a parking lot.
Now, a single day outside, living is OK, not one day.
It also affects and impacts every aspect of your life,
and it tends to make you hard to trust people.
Especially since I became a new father,
living outside was something I couldn't let happen
to my daughter.
Just trying to revolve for my child,
I was often approached by law enforcement officers
when I was living on the streets.
Many times it felt like officers had no respect for me
simply because I didn't have housing.
For instance, I remember times where police would miss
having my personal items, and on several occasions,
they destroyed my property.
The things that I used to make a living, like my microphones and my five gallon buckets
that I used as drums.
This stuff made almost nothing to them, but really meant so much to me.
I call them priceless.
It never broke my spirit though.
However, does the humanizing and embarrassing feelings made me feel like I didn't matter,
but I matter.
And I have a right to dignity and respect regardless of my housing situation.
That's why it means so much to me that the first proposal of SPLC's new report is that
people that with lived experiences like me should be at the center of the efforts to fight
back against criminalization of people experiencing homelessness.
We are statistics, we ain't just numbers, we are real people.
stories just like the one I just shared with you today, my truth. We are people who need
safety and secure housing, affordable rent, and livable wages. At other resources meant
to support us and securing a full-time housing. This is what we need, not living in constant
fear of being arrested for just trying to have somewhere to eat and sleep. Today I'm living
in my new apartment safely thanks to the support and service providers in Athens, Georgia.
something that is permanent to share with my partner and my daughter.
I will continue to be the voice for the people, such as my hero, James Brown,
the Godfather of Seoul as a gentleman.
We got to bring this to the frontline.
Will you stay with me today in the fight for all people who want better,
but just don't know the way.
We, the people, divided we stand, together we stand, divided we fall.
Thank you for all your time.
Thank you.
Thank you to both Gina for her excellent work
and for Jerry for lending his voice to this fight.
Now we will hear, finally, from our last speaker,
I mean, is going to be Senator Kim Jackson from District 41,
who is a longtime advocate in one of our champions.
Well, good afternoon.
I am State Senator Kim Jackson.
and I represent District 41,
which covers portions of the cab and Gwinnett counties.
I have spent several years fighting to solve a statewide issue
that's incredibly near to my heart,
and I'm excited to be here today
with the Southern Parvity Law Center
and the SBL Action Fund,
as they release their new report, sheltering injustice.
As many of you know, we are dealing with a real crisis in our state.
Again, as of 2022, approximately 10,700 people were reported as experiencing homelessness
in Georgia.
And 52% of those who are experiencing homelessness are sleeping outside in cars or in other places
not meant for human habitation. We must address this crisis now. And I want to take a moment to
acknowledge that the incredible steps of the city of Atlanta has made an alleviating homelessness
in this city, including the fact that they opened a brand new 40 unit, rebrap it re-housing
community just this Saturday. A huge thank you to the mayor, Andre Dickens, for signing an
executive order allocating $4.6 million towards continued efforts to end homelessness.
But let me be clear. Homelessness is not just an Atlanta issue. This is a statewide crisis that
that requires a statewide coordinated response.
We and the Georgia General Assembly
can and must do more.
In 2022, as part of a continued step to address this crisis,
the Senate formed a bipartisan study
committee on unsheltered homelessness.
And the Department of Audits and Accounts
recently performed an audit on homelessness spending.
Those reports, the final report from the study committee
and from the state's audits and accounts initiatives
called for a better, higher level coordination process
across agencies in Georgia.
The SPLC Action Fund explored this idea
and together we've come up to the place
where we are wanting to create an interagency council
to enact practical solutions for this crisis.
There are similar councils like this across the states
and we need one in Georgia.
The good news is that our state is not lacking in resources
to solve the problem.
We're just lacking in coordination to solve the problem.
And that's why I am proud to announce today
that in coordination with SPLC Action Fund
and Legislative Council, we will be introducing legislation
that revamps our previous efforts
and helps to create an interagency council on homelessness
and one that ensures that the council includes people
who have first-hand experience with homelessness.
This legislation, I want to introduce this legislation
in the coming weeks.
And I look forward to my colleagues supporting me
in this effort to do proactive good legislation on behalf
love and with those who are experiencing homelessness.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, Senator Jackson.
Thank you all for being here.
Thank you to all of the advocates behind me
who have been part of this fight with us.
That concludes today's press conference.
We know that other folks need this space,
so we're going to huddle over here
to answer any questions from the press.
Thank you all again and have a good afternoon.
