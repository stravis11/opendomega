>> I am so thrilled today to have one of my

grateful that Natasha Reed Rice is

just a little more about her background
other than that she is a minister that
at my church that I very much respect.
She is also a global equity and
inclusion strategist and attorney and a
transformational and impactful preacher
which I can personally attest to. Um,
Natasha Reed Rice is also, she wears
many hats, Habitat for Humanities
International Vice President of Housing
Opportunities and Mission Engagement
and is leading the development and
execution of Habitat's global strategy.
In that regard, she also served as
associate general counsel at Habitat for
Humanity, where she managed financing
programs and strategies to generate
sources of capital to enable Habitat
affiliates to build affordable housing
with families throughout the United
States.
Uh in addition to her work at Habitat,
Natasha served as an associate pastor at
the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church for
11 years before now serving as the
minister for public life at All Saints
Episcopal Church where my family and I
attend services.
Uh in addition to all of her
professional pursuits, uh Natasha also
does so much good work in the community,
putting her passion into action by
serving on the following boards. the
executive committee of the global
Harvard Alumni Association, the
International Women's Forum, Goodwill of
North Georgia, the Community Foundation
of Greater Atlanta, the Redress
Movement,
Atlanta Neighborhood Development
Partnership,
and Out of Hand Theater. And in her free
time, although I can't imagine how she
has any, um, Natasha enjoys cooking,
hiking, traveling, and spending time
with her husband, Corey, and their three
adult children, Kayla, Malachi, and
Caleb.
Thank you so much, Pastor Reed. Rice.
>> Thank you.
>> Good morning.
>> Thank you to the senator from the 44th
and to Mr. president and to all of you
all for extending this space for me to
join you this morning. I must say um in
a personal point of personal privilege
as a daughter of Georgia from Atlanta
now living in Henry County with my roots
in Snellville, Georgia. This is a great
honor. So, thank you all for having me
with you today. Um here is a topic and
I'll be brief. I was told by Mr. Brown I
have a little window of time. Um, but
I'd like us to think and consider this
topic. Don't run from the shadows. And
if I had a subtitle, it would be have
more courage than the groundhog.
As you all know, yesterday was Groundhog
Day. And in this frigid environment,
apparently the groundhog saw its shadow
and ran back into its hole. So, winter
for six more weeks. based upon
Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that
says that if a groundhog known there as
Pixatani Phil comes out of hibernation
and sees its shadow and runs back into
the hole, then winter will last for
another six weeks. And there appears to
be some historical connection between
the wintertime celebration of the
Groundhog Day and the ancient Christian
holiday called Candle Moss. Some of you
might be familiar with it. Candle Moss
is a Christian holiday that commemorates
the Virgin Mary presenting Jesus to God.
St. stay with me. I'm not going to get
too churchy because I know our audience
and what it is I'm trying to press us
forward into. And that's also a day when
people would bless candles in churches
to bring blessings to their households.
In the story of Candle Moss, Mary is a
witness of what it looks like not to run
from the shadows. Because in spite of
the scary environment in which she
birthed her son Jesus, the threats
against Jesus's life as a firstborn son,
she made her way to the temple, a place
that was the central institution in the
lives of the people to raise light, her
baby Jesus, in the midst of darkness,
and to raise love in the midst of
division. That took courage.
So, I've been reflecting quite a bit
these days on what courage means. What
does it actually mean beyond concept and
when put into practice?
Here are a few of the great courageous
folks that we know of through history.
And this is what they've said. Winston
Churchill says, "Courage is what it
takes to stand up and speak. And courage
is also what it takes to sit down and
listen."
Mandela says, "I learned that courage
was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it." And Dr. Maya Angelou
says that courage is the most important
important of the virtues because without
it no other virtue can be practiced
consistently. She says you can be kind
and true and fair and generous and just
even merciful occasionally.
But to be that thing time after time you
have to have courage. And courage is not
always loud but it is never silent.
Courage can help us to confront evil and
violence rather than cower and run from
the shadows. And this is the type of
courage that calls out evil and demands
that it leave. This is the type of
courage that I believe that we need in
the world today. A courage that stands
on integrity, is imbued with kindness,
relies upon honed expertise, has a
groundedness and a flat-footedness that
declares just reality in the face of
injustice. that declares unity and
community in the face of divisiveness
that declare declares truth in the face
of lies and love in the face of hate. So
how do we those who are serving
communities throughout the state of
Georgia embrace this call to courage?
Well, the first I would put forth as a
as a howto is to choose curiosity over
fear. Irish poet James Stevens wrote
that curiosity will conquer fear even
more than bravery will. With the
curiosity that you all approach in your
particular representative capacities,
you're asking your folks, your
constituencies, what are the real
problems and then together thinking
through what the real solutions could
be. That is the type of curiosity that
pushes us all to stand up in the face of
the mountains that we're all facing.
Curiosity causes us to ask questions,
helps us to better understand others,
the solutions, the situations, and
develop to develop more innovative
policies that can move mountains and
impact generations to come. I also think
that this call to courage is calling us
to imagine.
The great author Tony Morrison says, "As
you enter positions of trust and power,
like the seats you all hold, dream a
little before you think." What does it
look like to dream? In the midst of all
the social media algorithms and all of
the to-do list, what would it look like
if we paused for one moment to dream, to
think together, and to imagine? This
call to courage to not run from our
shadows, I believe, calls us into spaces
where we're willing to dream bravely,
where we're willing to dream beyond
partisan entrenchment, into a place
where we create a reality for all
Georgians to thrive. This call to
courage is a call to choose the
prophetic over the partisan. And before
you cancel out the prophetic and think
that you're not a prophet of old, let's
just be reminded of what a prophet is. A
prophet is like an artist who looks at a
blank canvas and paints a masterpiece. A
prophet is a homebuilder who looks at
communities that have been neglected and
says, "We can build community here and
walls get erected and windows get put in
and roofs get put upon it."
A prophet is like each one of you when
you come into this space and listen to
all those bills that were read so
magnificently fast
and think about how do we turn that into
policies that changed the generations to
come in the state of Georgia. That is
the work of the prophetic. Old Testament
theologian and scholar Walter Bugamman
says, "I think a prophet is someone that
tries to articulate the world as though
God were really active in the world." He
says that a prophet identifies with some
clarity and boldness the kinds of
political economic practices that
contradict the purposes of God and then
pivot and talk with confidence that God
is working out an alternative world of
well-being and justice and peace and
security in spite of that contradiction.
We are being called to the prophetic
work over the partisan work. We are
being called to think about things with
courage and cross over divisions and
divides because our children are
depending upon us to be courageous and
not run from our shadows. And when we
imagine together, we ignite our
collective hope. Not a hope that sits on
a shelf, but a hope that is gritty, that
has bloodied knuckles, that has grit
between its teeth, that says in spite of
what it may look like, we together can
build a Georgia, can build communities
that actually turn into hopeful
solutions for generations to come.
Called to curious, called to imagine,
and finally, called to community. And
how do we build community in this
moment? We have to figure out how to
love out loud. Justice is what love look
is what love looks like in public.
Justice is what it looks like to love
neighbor as self. Justice causes us to
build bridges across difference, to have
courageous conversations, to push aside
the isms, and to figure out what unites
us more than what divides us. I love
this quote from Barbara Brown Taylor who
says, "The only clear line I draw these
days is this. When my religion tries to
come between me and my neighbor, I will
always choose my neighbor because my God
never told me to love my religion.
The call to community is a call to
figuring out the hard stuff, which is
what we're elected, you are elected in
this place to do. Figuring out the hard
stuff, to figure out how we create
solutions that benefit our state, our
cities, and our towns. I'm the child of
a white woman who came to Spellelman
College in 1968.
She met my father, a black man from
Snellville, Georgia, and they fell in
love. And in spite of her father's hate
letter writing campaign, they married.
They went on a date after they married.
My mother was carrying me in her belly
at the old Rialto Theater before it
became part of Georgia State. And they
were held at gunpoint by a man who did
not agree with their love or the fact
that she was carrying the fruit of her
love. And he held my mother at gunpoint.
I often say I was held at gunpoint
that the love that was produced the the
fruit that was produced by my parents
love was held at gunpoint because of
racism.
Fortunately, they survived that moment
and my parents two years later went up
to see my grandfather who had written
all of these hateful letters. And I
toddled out of the back of this orange
van again. I'm dating myself. And ran to
my grandmother and jumped and my
grandfather and jumped. And all he could
do was catch me. And when he did, he
balled with tears. And from that day
forward, never said another hateful
word. Love always wins.
When we love out loud,
we become the representatives of what
community looks like, of what courage
looks like, and we're able to dwell in
this world house that we've all been
given. Dr. King's final book, Where Do
We Go From Here, Chaos or Community? He
writes a final chapter that talks about
this worldhouse vision. And in it, he
says, "This is the great new problem of
humankind. We have inherited a large
house,
a great world house in which we all have
to live together. Black and white,
Eastern and Westerner, Gentile and Jew,
Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and
Hindu, a family unduly separated in
ideas and culture and interest, who
because we can never again live apart,
must learn somehow to live with each
other in peace. Don't run from the
shadows. Won't you join me in a word of
prayer?
To the great one who created each and
every one of us in this amazing world to
live in and to figure out how to do so
together and in peace. We give you
thanks this morning. We don't take it
for granted that we're here, that we are
in representative capacities to bring
forth justice and well-being to our
state, our cities, our towns, ultimately
our nation, and our world. Help us to be
the leaders who can lead with courage,
with curiosity.
Help us to dream and imagine
what it could be if we loved out loud.
Help us to figure out how to move the
mountains before us, the divisions
before us, out of the way that we might
create thriving communities.
Help us to listen
so that in doing so, innovation is
birthed, strategies are birthed,
policies are birthed
that impact positively the generations
to come. We give you thanks for this
great mantle of responsibility and ask
that you might give us the strength and
the courage to shepherd them
accordingly. In your name we pray.
Together we all said, "Amen."
>> Wonderful.
It is uh now time to introduce our
doctor of the day. It's always nice
having our physicians come down here and
volunteer their time.
And to do that, I recognize Senator, a
good doctor herself, Senator from uh
Cobb County to introduce our doctor of
the day, Cobb County.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like for
you all to meet Dr. Stephanie Stiglets.
Dr.
Dr. Stiglets is a family physician in my
district in Marietta with WellStar.
But the most exciting thing I think
about Dr. Stiglets is she went to
nursing school first and worked as an
ICU nurse before going to medical school
at MCG in Augusta. She's dedicated to
patient center comprehensive care and as
a family physician, she's well equipped
to take care of any of all y'all that
have problems today. So with that, I'll
introduce Dr. Stiglet.
>> All right, come on up.
>> Thank you, Senator.
As a primary care physician, a big part
of my job is creating long-term
relationships with my patients and
listening to their concerns, validating
their concerns. Um, I know that a lot of
the decisions that are made in this room
and in this building have a direct
impact on my ability to deliver care to
my patients. Uh, so with that being
said, I do want to thank you all for
your service. Thank you for all that you
do for Georgians and I appreciate and
it's a huge honor to be able to serve as
your doctor of the day. So, thank you.
>> All right. Good job.
We have some very special guests here
today that we would like to recognize.
Secretary will read the resolution.
Senate resolution 611 by senators Walker
the 3rd of the 20th and others. A
resolution recognizing and commending
the Georgia Association of Community
Care Providers and for other purposes.
Whereas the Georgia Association of
Community Care Providers represents home
and community based service providers
across the state of Georgia who deliver
compassionate highquality care to
individuals with disabilities, complex
care needs, and aging populations. And
whereas these providers serve
communities throughout Georgia with a
significant number operating in
underserved and rural areas where access
to care is limited and community-based
providers are often the primary source
of support for individuals and families.
Now therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate that the members of this body

Association of Community Care Providers
and extend best wishes for continued
growth and success. Mr. President, that

In 2025, Kennesaw State football also

Bryant National Newcomer Coach of the
Year. So, with that, I'd love to have
Coach Mack make a few remarks. Let's
welcome them to the chamber. Thank you.
First of all, I would like to thank all
the members and our lieutenant governor
and also uh Senator Kirk Patrick for
allowing us to come and celebrate this
wonderful uh accomplishment of winning
Conference USA championship. Uh my
family and I, we're extremely happy and
and excited to be in Georgia right now.
Uh the energy and the excitement around
KSU and our community has just been
outstanding. It shows you what a group
of people when there's alignment at our
university can do when we all come
together. Our president uh our president
swag Milton Overton our athletic
director, our players, our coaches, all
our support staff. It has just been a
wonderful year for KSU and everything
that we have going on at our university.
The support in this room means
everything to us and understanding how
much it really means is just we'll
continue to build a great program. It is
our hope and it's our dream to continue
to host championship trophies just like
this every single year and we're working
hard to make KSU something that the
entire state of Georgia can be extremely
proud of. Thank you. All right.
All right. And uh now it is time to
recognize
a special group of young ladies that
come down here every year. And that is
our Girl Scouts. And they are
everywhere. I don't know if y'all have
noticed or not, but they are in the
hallways, in the gallery. I mean, they
are they are I hope y'all buying some
cookies. We're going to find out.
>> They always say that they always tell me
their worst sales is when they come down
to the legislature. So, y'all need to
pick your game up a little bit. So, but
uh but anyways, we're glad to have them.
They are hardworking
role models in their communities and we
love having the Girl Scouts down here.
Secretary, read the caption.
Senate resolution 637 by senator's
parent of the 44th and others. A
resolution recognizing February 3rd,
2026 as Girl Scout Day at the SC state
capital and commending the Girl Scouts
as a national leader in providing the
best leadership development experience
in the world to American girls and for
other purposes. Whereas more than a
century ago, native Savanian Juliet
Gordon Lowe started the movement known
as the Girl Scouts. Whereas the life
mission of Juliet Gordon Lowe was to
build girls of courage, confidence, and
character.
And whereas today the Girl Scouts of
Historic Georgia and Greater Atlanta
Councils serve approximately 43,000 Girl
Scout members in the state of Georgia.
Now therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate that the members of this body
recognize February 3rd, 2026 as Girl
Scout Day at the state capital and
commend the Girl Scouts as a national
leader in developing girls of courage,
confidence, and character. Mr.
President, that completes the order.
Is there objection to adoption of the
resolution? Chair hears none and the
resolution is adopted.
I'd like to recognize the senator from
the 44th to recognize our very special
guest and speak to the resolution.
Senator.
>> Terrific.
>> Thank you so much, Mr. President. I am
so excited to have the Girl Scouts. It
is my favorite day in the state capital
when we have all the Girl Scouts here.
And this year there are a thousand of
them um all throughout our halls. And
that really warms my heart to see all of
these young women um who are going to
grow up to be such incredible leaders
here in Georgia and beyond. But I have
to tell you, when I first walked in the
chamber this morning, I almost had a
heart attack because there weren't any
cookies. And I always, you know, we
always make sure the Girl Scouts always
make sure that there are cookies on our
desks. And I walked in and instead of
cookies, there were like toothbrushes.
And I was like, you know what? We got to
get rid of these toothbrushes. Please
bring the sugar that we are all waiting
for. Where are the cookies? And I have
to give credit to the staff because they
did that switch. Bye-bye toothbrushes.
Hello, dessert. Um, and there are some
new flavors this year. So, I do
encourage you to, you know, peek around
at what your neighbors have. Um,
colleagues, I've sp had the honor of
sponsoring this resolution for many
years now. And and because in
particular, the Girl Scouts were founded
by
uh Juliet Gordon Low in Savannah,
Georgia, right here in our state in
1912. We have a special relationship
with the Girl Scouts and all of you
already know that they are a national
leader in providing leadership
development experiences for girls here
in the states but even around the world.
They run hands-on girl-led girl centered
learning focused on STEM, the outdoors
and entrepreneurship.
And the number of women leaders in our
country, including many of uh myself and
many of my our colleagues here in the
chamber, were Girl Scouts when we were
young.
That's right. Center from the 43rd. Um,
so it's uh it's just such an honor to
recognize the great work being done by
the Girl Scouts and to commend these
young leaders for what they are doing in
their communities today and what I know
they will do once they are adults. Um,
but the treat is always getting to hear
from the Girl Scouts themselves. So,
I'll just introduce our special guests.
We have CEO of Girl Scouts of Greater
Atlanta, Jai Ferrell.
Yes. And we have um Girl Scouts Gloria
Campbell. And her mother is here, too.
Although Laura, she's in the back, I
think. Oh, there she is. There's um Miss
Laura Campbell. And we also have Sydney
Girtton Cosy joining us up here at the
podium. So, I am going to turn it over
to Miss Gloria Campbell.
>> All right. Gloria.
>> Yeah.
>> Hello. My name is Gloria Campbell and
I'm a Girl Scout from Atlanta, Georgia.
I've been in Girl Scouts for 7 years.
And some of my favorite things about
Girl Scouts are the traveling, camping,
and fun activities I get to do with all
of my friends in my Girl Scout troop. I
really recommend Girl Scouts to anyone
who can join because it has fun,
friends, adventure, and most
importantly, cookies.
>> Thank you.
>> Well, I guess I can't come behind
cookies, but my name's Jai Frell and I'm
CEO of Girl Scouts of Greater Atlanta.
I'd be remiss if I don't acknowledge the
CEO of Greater of Historic Georgia,
which is in that Savannah corridor. Uh,
where are they? They're up there in the
front. I mean, up there at the top, we
have about a thousand girls here today.
But I want to tell you guys, thank you.
Thank you for advocating for our girls.
Uh, the Greater Atlanta Council is over
35,000 girls in 35 counties throughout
Georgia. So, wherever you turn and you
see you see a Girl Scout, but you also
see a a future leader of courage,
confidence, and character. So, again,
thank you so much. Um, we have some
things that are coming up very soon,
particularly our license plate tag. So,
we look forward to your delicious
support as is the boxes of the cookies
on your table. Thank you.
>> All right. Good job. [applause]
All right, ladies.
Are there any uh unanimous consents?
Does any senator wish to rise on point
of personal privilege?
Recognize a senator from the ninth for a
point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. I know we have
already acknowledged the Girl Scouts
today, but I want to acknowledge the
ones that are specifically from my
district in District 9. So, I rise today
for a personal point of privilege to
recognize Girl Scout Troop 22109,
the eighth grade Girl Scouts at Cruz
Middle School, and the Girl Scout
freshman at Brookwood High School. Are
you guys up there at all? Okay, I'm
going to say they're probably out in the
hall. Being part of the Girl Scouts, as
we know, is about more than earning
badges. It's about learning. It's about
courage. It's about leadership. It's
about com confidence. is everything that
we would want for any woman that would
stand in this space as an elected or
otherwise. And it's about understanding
what you will stand for and knowing that
your voice matters. Each of you is
living through one of the most important
influential stages in your life. These
are the years when you will discover who
you are, what excites you, what you
believe in, and what is possible. But
choosing to be part of Girl Scouts, you
are already doing something powerful.
You are showing up. You're trying new
things. And you're pushing beyond your
limits. As you grow and push beyond your
limits, one of the most meaningful
lessons you will learn is that none of
this happens alone. None of what we are
doing here today happens alone. One of
the greatest strengths of the Gwynet
County Girl Scouts is the community that
you build together. The friendships you
form and the trust you create teach you
how to work with others, how to listen,
and how to lead with empathy. What young
girls learn when young girls learn these
skills early, our democracy becomes
stronger. As you continue on the path of
leadership and service, I will leave you
with a thought to carry you forward.
There are plenty of ways to enter the
pool. The stairs are not one of them.
And with that, Mr. President, I yield a
well.
Recognize Senator from the seventh for a
point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Today, many are recognizing mental
health parody day here at the Capitol.
And I want to start with something
simple.
Mental health is health. That's why in
2022, this chamber voted for the Mental
Health Parody Act. It was understood
what Georgians already knew. When you
ignore mental health, you don't save
money. You just shift the cost. You
shift it to emergency rooms. You shift
it to jails. You shift it onto teachers
and grandparents. And you shift it onto
kids who can't focus in schools and
parents who can't sleep at night. Par
means equality. It means mental health
care must be treated the same as
physical care. It means insurance
companies don't get to play games,
denying treatment, delaying care,
charging more, or throwing up extra
barriers for mental health. But here's
the hard truth. A right on paper is not
a right in practice if nobody enforces
it. Parity without enforcement is just
hopes and dreams. Because laws don't
enforce themselves, regulators do. And
in Georgia, that job belongs to the
insurance commissioner, John King. So
tell So let me tell you about John
King's failures. When we passed this law
to protect Georgia families, we passed
it to make sure a mom seeking therapy
after postpartum depression isn't
treated like she's asking for a luxury.
We passed it so a teenager with panic
attacks isn't met with a denial letter
instead of care. We passed it so a
working dad battling addiction can get
treatment before he loses his job, his
home, his life. And where was our
insurance commissioner? Nowhere.
For years, Georgians kept getting
denied. Families kept getting slammed
with extra requirements. People kept
getting told, "Try again. File another
form. Wait another month. We don't cover
that. We don't cover that provider. We
don't cover that level of care." And
where was John King?
He was lombasted in the news for being
idle. He said, quote, "My job is to
maintain a stable marketplace for
insurance, so we ought to be respectful
of that because nothing's free. I'm not
interested in throwing money or beating
up on the insurance industry." End
quote. He said his job was to protect
insurance companies, not people. Getting
King to understand the law has been a
challenge because he is not talking with
mental health advocates or
professionals. Advocates said even his
own party, Republican legislators said
King wasn't enforcing the law. It should
not take a newspaper story to force the
insurance commissioner to do his job.
And even when John King's hands were
forced to even when John King's hands
were forced to enforce the mental health
health parody law, he refused to to tell
last year's insurance study committee
who he was actually finding because he
said, quote, "The biggest offender might
have the biggest market share." End
quote. He is protecting insurance
companies, not people. The insurance
commissioner finally levied fines last
month. Now, let me be clear. I support
penalty penalties when companies break
the law. But if penalt but if the
penalty is small compared to what these
companies make off Georgians every year,
what message does that send? Does that
lower premiums? Does that get people to
into treatment faster? Does that stop
the next denial letter from landing in
someone's mailbox tomorrow? If the cost
of breaking the law is just a small fee,
a rounding error, then it's not a
deterrent, it's a price tag. I will
repeat that again. If the cost of
breaking the law is just a small fee, a
rounding error, it is not a deterrent,
it is a price tag. And that means
insurance companies didn't fail the
system. They played the they played the
system exactly as it was designed.
Because when the referee refuses to call
this the foul, the fouls keep coming.
That's not leadership. That's politics.
I came to this chamber to fight for
Georgia families because I know what
it's like when people when the system is
built to tell regular people no and
built to protect the people with money
and influence. Mental Health Parity Day
should not be a ceremonial moment. It
should be a demand. A demand that the
promise we made in 2022 becomes real in
2026. Not just in theory. not just in
headlines, but in the lived reality of
Georgia families. Because par does not
mean a loophole. It does not mean a
paperwork maze. It does not mean we'll
get to it when we feel like it. Par
means equal. Par means now. Par means
the law applies to everyone, including
powerful insurance companies. John King
had years to protect Georgians. He chose
insurance companies instead. He only
acted when he was forced to. Georgia
deserves an insurance commissioner who
works for the people, not a puppet of
the insurance companies. Thank you. And
I yield the well.
>> Recognize the majority leader.
>> Mr. President, point of order.
State your order.
>> Isn't it ironic or is it not true that
none of the Republicans running for
statewide office are coming down to this
well to give their campaign speeches
while the Democrats want to keep coming
down here and wasting our time?
>> Ah, well,
the senator is passionate about what he
speaks.
Got a lot of folks running for statewide
offices, I tell you.
Senator from the 36. Are you running for
statewide office?
>> You stay right there. [laughter]
[gasps]
>> All right. Recognize Senator from the
32nd.
Hey colleagues. Um, I'm back again to
tell you that today is Aerospace and
Defense Day at the Capitol. As some of
you know, I serve on the Georgia Joint
Defense Commission, and we've discovered
that there's more to our military
installations than just the bases. The
surrounding communities and defense
industries are key players in our
economy.
Please take the opportunity to stop by
the rotunda to see the F-35 simulator
provided by Lheed Martin and talk with
one of the pilots.
I think there are some people from the
aerospace industry in the gallery. If
so, would you stand up?
They may not have made it here yet. In
any case, Georgia is a leader in
aerospace and I'm proud to welcome this
industry to the capital. Please take
advantage of the opportunity. Thank you.
Do I yield the wealth?
>> All right. Good job. Good job.
>> Thank you, Senator.
And if you haven't seen that exhibit
downstairs, I would I would recommend
going down there. It It is It is really
neat. That simulator they have down
there is pretty neat to get in and
attempt to fly if you can.
I recognize the chairman of public
safety, Senator from 56, for a point of
personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. It is
firefighter day here at your Georgia
capital. Always very excited and honored
to represent my brothers and sisters in
the fire service. We have
representatives here from our fire
chiefs association, from our
firefighters association, as well as
numerous other groups that are in the
building today. Uh you will notice uh on
a lot of the announcements that at 2:30
on the south steps we're going to have
the large gathering uh where we'll have
uh numerous speakers uh and celebrate
the great work and the mission of what
we do each and every day uh in all your
communities. And as a quick reminder,
there are over 900 fire departments in
our great state of Georgia with over
30,000 men and women who are serving
either a full-time, a part-time, or a
volunteer capacity to respond in your
most critical time of need. Part of our
umbrella of first responders that are
always out there serving Georgians. So,
I'd ask you today as you see
firefighters, not just from your
district, but from all over the state,
you take a moment and shake their hand.
We thank them for their service to our
community. And thank you for this Senate
and the president of our body and
lieutenant governor for passing so many
pro- firefighter and first responder
pieces of legislation because they know
that we have their back. Please give
them a round of applause.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Governor. [applause]
Thank you, Senator. And we do greatly
appreciate all our firefighters for
being down here today and appreciate
everything that you do, all the men and
women across the state. So, thank
you'all very much.
Recognize Senator from the 40th for a
point of personal privilege.
>> Thank you, Mr. Mr. President, I rise
this morning to talk about health care
and our young people because you see, I
had a constituent who came to me who has
a child who just turned 26 last fall. I
too have a child that turned 26 last
fall. This is um a critical age because
at this point our our kids cannot be on
our health insurance anymore. So
hopefully by this time they've graduated
from college and they've gotten a job
and they're able to afford health care
on their own. But it turns out the life
is pretty tough for our young people who
are struggling to get along in the
world. What happened to my constituent's
kid is they got they got him signed up
for an ACA plan. It was subsidized
because this kid is at the beginning of
his career and isn't making a whole lot
of money yet. All of us were in that
same um situation at one point and the
policy costs like $106 a month which was
totally affordable. But then in mid
December he got a letter saying that the
rate had gone from $106
to over $500 a month which meant he
didn't have enough money to have the
policy. So he ended up becoming
uninsured.
This is somebody's kid.
According to what I've heard, 200,000
people who had health insurance last
year are now uninsured. So, this was one
story, but there are 200,000 other
stories. When I heard this story, my my
my heart fell because I'm like, I wonder
if my kid got one of those letters. So,
I immediately got on the phone and my
child is is checking on it. Um, but I'm
worried as a parent. I'm worried. What
does this feel like to a young person
who has done all the right things, is
trying to still do the right things, and
can't afford health insurance, and has
to just take the risk that nothing bad
happens? How do you think this makes
parents feel who do all the right things
when they raise their kids, teach their
kids about um financial, how to how to
handle finances and and how to get along
in the world and and then their kid is
uninsured. And you know that
your kid can end up in the hospital and
in debt for hundreds of thousands of
dollars, which if the kid can't afford
to pay that kind of debt, all of a
sudden it's like all that money that the
parent has saved for retirement or
whatever is at risk because you're going
to help your kid if your kid's in the
hospital, right? I mean, this is these
are heartbreaking stories. Um, and very
real stories. And you know, a $250
tax rebate that's going to buy about two
weeks of health care,
a homestead exemption, a property tax
break or elimination isn't going to help
these kids because they don't own homes.
An income tax break isn't going to help
because
they're not making that much money. So,
their their tax bill is already either
zero or next to zero.
And it's Republicans in Washington that
chose made a decision to not do anything
to help these young people. You probably
have young people in your lives. Maybe
they're not old enough to be affected by
this. or maybe they're older and they're
established and they have their health
care,
but it's going to hit you at some point.
You're going to have a grandkid who's
uninsured. It's hit 200,000 people
already here in Georgia.
And so I ask you each and every
individual in this in your seat, is this
really what you want? Thank you, Mr.
President. I yield the well.
Recognize Senator from 33rd for a point
of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President, my fellow
senators, colleagues, friends, and
y'all.
Today is this month in February is Black
History Month.
And I'm going to start it out with a
little story here, but I want to let
everybody know in the chamber, all the
senators, that you should be receiving
an email shortly where you can sign up
to come up and say a few words on black
history.
Today, I'm going to talk about
Paul Lawrence Dunbar, born in 1872, the
son of former slaves. Paul Lawrence
Dunar overcame abject poverty to become
one of the first black poets to achieve
national acclaim. The only
African-American in his high school
class, Dunar excelled academically,
serving as the editor of his high school
newspaper and class poet. After
graduating, Dunar struggled in his in
pursuit of his dream to become a writer,
publishing his first book of poems,
Oak and Ivy, in n in 1893
with his own money and selling copies to
those who
to those riding the elevator on which he
worked as an operator.
refusing to abandon his passion for
writing Dunar Publix's lyrics of love
lowly life in 1896
a work which pres re received
positive reviews and served to launch
Dunar's career although most known for
his dialect poetry which conveyed the
character of the black community Dunar
pinned a large body of five literary
works including essay, short stories,
and novels and plays which work to make
him the successful poet he is. I thank
you very much. That was your Black
History moment brought to you by Senator
Red. Don't forget Senator Red.
Recognize Senator from the 22nd for a
point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. Um, I don't
know if I can beat the cookies, but
we'll try with our masters hats that are
here because today is actually Augusta
day. Members from Augusta here from our
leadership Augusta, they'll be here and
also um members from Augusta business
community are also here. So, if you see
them in the hallway and they have
Augusta badge on, please welcome them.
But they are responsible for giving you
these great hats that people have asked
for more, but we only have one per um
legislator, so that's all we get. But I
do want to recognize I think we have a
couple of folks in the gallery. Please
join me in recognizing our folks from
Augusta. If you please stand real quick.
[applause]
Thank you. And with that, Mr. President,
I yield the well.
>> Recognize center for the first.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. And I'll be
brief since I'm not running for any
office by any means. Uh but maybe I
should uh because so much misinformation
out there and just I want to give the
big picture relating to uh health care
and insurance. If you'll recall recall
eight sessions ago, Governor Kemp's
first bills were the waiver to the ACA.
And guess what? Georgia did a fabulous
job of this.
We have done uh on the ACA a state-based
exchange
which ensures wow over 700,000 Georgians
and on the federal poverty level the the
below 100% on our waiver
we are used as an example for the rest
of the nation who have done Medicaid
explosion I mean expansion
yes
what has been done recently on the
exchange is drop back what was done
under the emergency health orders back
to what President Obama did in
Obamacare.
The exact same maybe.1%
or 2% difference much less than
inflation.
So, let's get our facts straight when it
comes to that. Uh, when it comes to the
exchange, when it comes to health care,
when it comes for insurance, especially
if you're running for office. Thank you.
recognize the senator from 54th.
Thank you, Mr. President. Uh my friends,
a few years back, we did a bill that I
carried in this chamber and was very
proud um to get it passed because of
passion is a personal passion of mine in
civic education and developing of young
people. And we passed Senate Bill 220 a
few years back that created the Georgia
Commission on Civics's Education.
and I was always been so extremely proud
of that. Well, day in the same light
today we have with us um engaged youth
in government in Georgia here with us
and we have or we have some in the
gallery. If y'all will please stand.
Could we give them a round of applause?
Mr. President, the this engage youth in
government. They literally are the
result and the purpose same as our
Senate bill 220 pass we passed. They
provide opportunities for students to
learn about the positions that serve in
federal, state and local municipalities
for governor from government governor,
mayor, council members to police, fire,
national security and military. And so
they literally are open up doors to
these young people. And we're so proud
of them and we are so proud to have each
and every one of you. And don't ever
ever forget,
we're the present.
You are the future. God bless each and
every one of you. Thank you.
Recognize Senator from the 36.
Senator from the 36. Got to get your
speech. Don't leave it.
you wave.
>> Senator, I called on you because I know
you won't landlast me like the some of
your colleagues did yesterday. You know,
had friends.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I
will take that as an invitation to make
daily appearances here down at the well.
Thank you.
Uh I I I I I'd like to take issue with a
comment that was made uh earlier uh from
this well this morning uh about the
appropriateness of of of commentary
that's shared by senators who take the
well for a point of personal privilege
which I'm now doing. And let let's be
clear about something. The Senate rules
allow every senator, all 56 of us, time
to do a point of personal privilege.
It doesn't matter if they're running for
statewide office or not. We seem to hear
a message from the majority leader that
that somehow if you're running for
statewide office, if you're running for
higher office, you somehow have lost the
ability to speak from the well freely
about subject matter that uh that uh
concerns you and that you would on with
and you'd like to share your opinion
about it. So, I would just say here's a
cautionary note. Don't pay any attention
to when if someone is trying to tell you
that your time in the well is not your
time in the well, but that it's it's uh
dictated by an imaginary
uh caution that was just issued from
this very well. that if you're running
for higher office, somehow
there there's a guard rail that you
can't cross uh in talking about an
issue,
framing an issue, talking about your
history on the issue, talking about the
state of the state uh of Georgia,
talking about how federal uh decisions
impact what we're seeing going on here
on the ground here around people losing
uh health insurance and massive numbers.
So
they can comment, we can comment on any
issue of interest to them and hope that
it would be of interest to others within
earshot.
And uh my friend from the seventh will
surely remember
uh since his first year in the Senate uh
when uh she was a necessary presence in
a study committee chaired by the
majority leader and I'm sure the
majority leader remembers that well uh
and the topic which was quite pertinent
to the duties of the uh department of
insurance and the insurance
commissioner. So, I just want to stand
and um loudly proclaim uh the right to
access the well to bring messages that
we deem as senators to be appropriate uh
and uh in the interests of the public
and of the Senate. Uh that is a
timehonored timehonored uh privilege
which we have as a member of this body.
And uh I would I would urge you don't
let anyone dissuade you from that fact.
Uh that's that's simply the truth of the
matter and I wanted to share uh my
thoughts on that with you today and
appreciate the privilege of uh points of
personal privilege and let us uphold
this tradition uh as we go forward.
Thank you so much. I yield the well.
recognize Senator from the 34th.
Good morning, Mr. President, colleagues.
Today I rise in recognition of Girl
Scout Day. I want to recognize troop
2489
from Huitt Elementary School in Clayton
County. 36 young ladies consistently
think outside the box, especially when
it comes to serving others. They host uh
globe parties, motivate students to
donate canned goods and they creativity
turns giving back things fun and
impactive. If uh troop 24089 are in the
well, can can they raise their hand?
Nope, they're gone. Well, thank you, Mr.
President. I'll yield the well.
>> Thank you, Senator. All right. Recognize
Senator from the 17th.
Hey, I got a topic for you. Come here.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Senators in 2024,
Republicans in this chamber voted
against Medicaid expansion.
You can call it Affordable Care Act or
you could call it Obamacare. I say
Obamacare because he cares. Since that
vote, over 200,000 Georgian have lost
their health insurance.
Those aren't statistics.
They're hardworking
families.
seniors, veterans, and kids. Across
Georgia, people are struggling with
rising costs, especially health care.
Coverage is slipping away while
premiums, deductibles, and hospitals
bills keep climbing.
Too many Georgians are delaying care,
rationing medicine, or skipping doctors
altogether.
There is a clear solution. Expand
Medicaid.
Just expand Medicaid now. Year after
year, we propose real tangible solutions
to the health crisis. And year after
year, the Republicans in this chamber
block those bills. Expansion will cover
hundreds of thousands of Georgians who
are currently stuck in the coverage gap.
It would stabilize hospitals, especially
in rural communities that are barely
hanging on.
Instead, the state relies on a limited
program with strict requirements that
reaches only a small share of those who
need help. That approach leave workers
uninsured even when they are doing
everything right.
At the same time, federal health
subsidies are at risk, which could drive
costs even higher for families who
already can't afford them. More people
will lose coverage unless this
legislature act, the Georgia
legislature. Medicaid expansion is
fiscally responsible.
The federal government covers the vast
majority of the cost, bringing billions
of dollars back to Georgia. So why
wouldn't we not expand Medicaid?
States that expand Medicaid saw job
growth, stronger local economies, and
healthier communities. This is not about
politics. It's about whether Georgia can
see a doctor when they get sick. No one
should die because they do not have
health care when they get sick. And I'm
not just advocating for it because I
have health issues. It's the right thing
to do. Democrats are offering solutions.
It's time for this body to do the same.
Expand Medicaid, protect families,
strengthen hospitals, and stop forcing
Georgians to pay the price for in
action. Colleagues, we need to expand
Medicaid now. Just do the right thing
and expand Medicaid. Thank you, Mr.
President. I yield the well.
recognize senator from the 14th.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm the
senator from the 14th and this is a
point of personal privilege for North
Fulton County in my district. Uh in
honor of Girl Scouts Day, we have
visitors here in the gallery from troop
18224.
That's uh from Hannesbridge Middle
School, Autry Mill Bridge, and Mount
Pisca Christian School. And we've got
troop leaders Jill Hardison, Melissa
Bllandon, Miranda Wiggleston. Uh, I
understand that the cadets are working
on their democracy for cadetses badge.
So, if you could please stand, if you're
still here. There they are. Great.
Awesome. We are so honored to have you
today. And can everybody help me join uh
these cadetses from North Fulton County.
Thank you very much.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
recognized senator from the 55th.
My distinguished colleagues, I paused
just a moment.
There are great uh beginnings and right
now we want to pause to for today is
Tucker Day. It is 10 years ago that a
baby was born and the baby is now. I
present the mayor and the people from
Tucker, which you all recognize the good
people from Tucker, the city of Tucker,
Georgia. This is Tucker Day. Thank you,
Tucker Day. Thank you very kindly.
Very nice to have the city of Tucker and
their leadership here today. Glad to
have each and every one of y'all down
here today. So, thank you. Does any
other senator wish to rise on a point of
personal privilege?
All right. You have before you a consent
calendar of privilege resolutions. Does
any senator wish to remove resolution
from the consent calendar?
Is there objection to the adoption of
the resolutions on the consent calendar?
Chair hears none. The resolutions on the
consent calendar are adopted.
Are there any motions to withdraw or
commit?
Recognize the majority leader for a
motion.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I move that
Senate Bill 382 be engrossed.
>> The majority leaders move that Senate
Bill 382 be engrossed. Secretary, read
the caption.
Senate Bill 382 by Senators Huff Settler
of the 52nd and others. A bill to be

Moved on to the rules calendar.
Secretary Reed, Senate Bill 420.
>> Senate Bill 420 by Senator Eckles of the
49th and others. A bill to be entitled
an act to amend code section 27-2-23 of
the official code of Georgia annotated
relating to license permit tag and stamp
fees so as to provide for fees for reef
and migratory fish endorsements to amend
code section 12-2-2 of the official code

of the official Code of Georgia
annotated relating to penalty
respectively so as to re revise
effective dates to provide for related
matters to repeal conflicting laws and
for other purposes. The Senate Committee
on Economic Development and Tourism
recommends that this bill do pass.
>> Mr. President, that completes the order.
>> I recognize a senator from the 49th
district to speak to Senate Bill 420.
Thank you, Mr. President. Uh, good
morning, colleagues. I know some of
y'all are here. When y'all saw SB 420,
you got here in a hurry. You thought
this was about something uh totally
different, but uh it's actually about
fishing this morning. And I'm uh
bringing this to you at the request of
Georgia's saltwater fishing industry.
With the support of the DNR, I bring
before you Senate Bill 420. This bill
creates an annual reef migratory fish
endorsement for the Georgia recreational
fishing fishing license and with
associated fees of $10 for residents and
$20 for non-residents. It also contains
language authorizing recent actions um
of our board of natural resources to uh
enforce their codify their uh rules and
laws that they pass their rules that
they passed last year. Using funding
generated by this license endorsement,
the database of endorsement holders,
Georgia DNR can produce more accurate
catch estimates for popular species like
red snapper and king mackerel than
they're currently produced by federal
law. For the past several years, Georgia
anglers have only been allowed to
harvest red snapper for one maybe two
days a year when that species is way
more abundant than u than has been
documented by um by the feds. Our
anglers are consistently losing
opportunities uh to fish um in our
neighboring states to the southeast
around the Gulf of America. They're
they're working um with the feds.
They've taken over um they've taken over
this um into into state hands. And what
this bill does is basically a user fee.
It's $10. If you want to uh catch red
snapper, it's a simple $10. The industry
wants it. It's pretty rare that an
industry comes to you and they say,
"Hey, charge us for what we're doing."
Um we they want reliable data. they want
to uh the
that species in particular of red
snapper to be managed more appropriately
than what it is. Um so with that I ask
for your favorable consideration of
SB420.
Mr. President, I yield for questions.
>> Chair Rager is the senator from the 42nd
for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator yield.
>> Yes, I yield. Sorry, I was a little late
getting in on this one. Um, Senate Bill
420, I see looks like we're allowing for
recreational reefing in this. Is that
correct? Is that something you support?
>> Rec. Excuse me. Would you repeat that?
>> It's recreational reefing. Is that
something that you support?
>> Reef, not reef.
>> Eer, that's R E F.
>> Do you further yield,
>> Senator? I further.
>> So, what's the difference between
reefing or reefer and reef?
>> I don't know. I would yield to the
senator from the 42nd. I'm sure he can
teach a lesson on that.
>> No more questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Any other
questions? Chair recognizes Senator from
the second for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Mr. President. Senator,
do you yield?
>> Uh, yes, sir.
>> Uh, Senator, does this bill involve
anything with moral turpitude? Um,
understanding the previous questions
that were asked, could you enlighten us
on that?
I'll let you and the senator from the
42nd have a uh conversation about that
offline.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Any other questions?
>> Are you a freshman?
>> Uh yes, sir. Okay.
>> A few more months.
>> All right.
No more questions, Senator.
>> Thank you.
>> Does any other senator wish to speak for
against the measure?
Chair hears none. Is there objection to
the previous question being ordered?
Chair hears none and the previous
question is ordered.
Is there objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which is
favorable to the passage of the bill?
The chair hears none. The report of the
committee is agreed to. Is there
objection to the main question being
ordered? Chair hears none and the main
question is ordered. The question is on
the passage of the bill. All those in
favor will vote yay. Oppose nay. The
secretary will unlock the machine.
No, it's not a touch screen. On the
motive,
>> this bill having received the requisite
constitutional
majority is now passed.
Chair recognizes Senator from the 50th.
>> Point of order, Mr. President.
>> What's your point of order?
>> Isn't it true that because of the
senator from the 49th, it's a bad day to
be a red snapper in the state of
Georgia?
>> Going to wear them out. Thank you,
Senator.
>> Secretary Reed, the caption of Senate

official code of Georgia annotated
relating to adalarium taxation of
property so as to make the statewide
base your homestead exemption mandatory
for all political subdivisions to repeal
a related tax bill requirement and for
other purposes. Mr. President, that
completes the order.
I recognize a senator from the 52nd to
speak to Senate Bill 382.
Thank you, Mr. President. We have Senate
Bill 382 before you today. It will
restore what the Senate passed by a 427
vote on February 15, 2024.
That was Senate Bill 349.
Two years ago, we had seen property
taxes being increased on homeowners by
doubledigit
increases year after year. We saw local
governments increased property taxes by
80, 90, some over 100% when you looked
over several years. We had seen local
schoolboard surpluses increase from 7
billion to over 14 billion in the bank
in the same time frame. And we've heard
from homeowners
who say they can't afford the massive
increases in their home taxes. They
can't afford it anymore.
Affordability is a word you've heard a
lot of this year. You've heard a lot of
it from me for multiple years.
And yet with a billion sitting in the
bank, we have local governments, mostly
school districts, saying they will not
be able to pay their bills unless they
continue these double-digit increases.
And they forget that while homeowner
taxes can only go up the rate of
inflation,
they can still increase the millage rate
and that the majority of property which
is not homeowner property can still go
up unchecked. This in no way keeps any
government from getting the revenue they
need. I have a long history with caps.
I helped put a cap on the Floyd County
taxpayers from the county commission in
2002.
I heard all the horror stories. I
refuted them in the press about
businesses were going to leave and they
wouldn't pay their bills. 24 years
later, it still exists. It hasn't slowed
down the government at all. As a matter
of fact, right after that, we got a
double A bond rating, our first ever for
Floyd County. And many other districts,
many of you here have done similar
measures in your communities,
and
they somehow still pay their bills. Um,
in one of my counties, Barto County,
after the school board had opted out, we
put it on the ballot last November to
make it mandatory, as many others here
did.
Having dealt with 90% tax increases over
the past few years, the citizens came
out for a second vote,
this one to make it mandatory, and it
passed by 90%.
In that same election, there was a PSC
election. Some people voted one way and
some people voted another, but they all
came together and voted for this
measure, this simple measure. So, we're
here because the original bill got
changed on the other side with an opt
out. And I know many House members over
there didn't want that either, including
the two that helped us in Barto County,
the senator from 37th and me and the the
two House members to put a local measure
on
Um, so shockingly or not shockingly, 70%
of the school districts opted out. About
20% of the cities did. And so here we
are with the majority of Georgians not
having the protection that others have.
And I looked around the country at other
states who have a cap in place. Some for
a while, some recently in Florida,
Texas, Nebraska, Massachusetts, which
has a 2 and a half% cap. South Carolina,
Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Delaware, Michigan, New York, New
Jersey, Oregon, New Mexico, and Iowa. I
didn't see an opt out in any of them.
That guts the protection for the
homeowner. That means affordability is
continuing to be a major problem.
Now, there's a second part of the bill,
and that's the floss penny that came out
of the House, but we agreed to that.
that would allow a penny to apply
towards property taxes.
Um 39 counties put it on the ballot. 90%
of them passed it this year.
One of them said the money doesn't get
to us quick enough and they didn't like
that part of it. So this is going to
address that.
And if this passes, it'll be available
for all 159 counties and 535 cities. In
Gordon County in my district where it
passed, the city of Calhoun says they
will eliminate their property tax.
In fact, the data shows that twothirds
of the cities in George will be able to
eliminate their property tax. The one
change in this bill is to address their
concerns, which was legitimate, which is
to get the money to the citizens
earlier. The original bill says the
money collected this year will be taken
off of property taxes next year. The
change says that the penny tax collected
through June June 30th of this year and
any subsequent years will be taken off
the taxes in this year. This November,
those 34 counties will see in many cases
hundreds of dollars less on their
property tax bill. So this will correct
what we probably should have done the
original bill and that's to get the
money to the people as soon as possible.
Now, I did hear one concern that I I did
want to address because many people have
stricter restrictions in Floyd County.
We don't have a an inflation. It's it's
frozen what it is. Others have
restrictions in place very similar
around the state. And that was like, we
don't want to operseed
what we've got. And it doesn't. It
doesn't change the original language in
House Bill 581.
Line 316 says the homestead exemption
that is larger or more beneficial for
the taxpayer with respect to the
particular taxing jurisdiction
jurisdiction
to which more than one baseear value
homestead applies that one will apply.
So if you have a better measure in
place, it already applies. My county
didn't opt out even though they got a
freeze because they said we don't have
to opt out. The law says our freeze
occurs. Some counties perhaps with
misunderstanding opted out thinking they
needed to. They didn't need to. Their
their freeze would have stayed in place.
So I did want to address that. Um the um
bill simply restores the original intent
that this Senate overwhelmingly passed
out and gets the floss money to the
taxpayer sooner. Mr. Mr. President, I
urge that we pass this affordability
bill in a bipartisan matter and I'll
certainly yield for any questions. Thank
you, Mr. President.
>> You do have questions, Senator.
Uh chair recognizes the senator from the
32nd for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chair,
would you yield?
>> Certainly.
Um, isn't it true that this bill does
not affect senior tax exemptions in the
counties?
>> Correct. This has nothing to do with any
senior tax exemptions in place. I know
uh you've got a pretty generous one in
Cobb County as one of your counties and
I don't know which county you're you're
referring to, but it does not affect
that at all.
>> And would you further yield for one
more?
>> Certainly. And Senator, isn't it also
true that this does not affect the sales
taxes in the various counties?
>> It has no effect on the sales tax. I
think some people because the House has
a bill that they're looking at that does
affect the sales tax maybe are getting
them confused, but this has no increase
in sales tax. The only thing that's
there is that original penny of floss
that they can go before the voters and
ask for.
>> Thank you, Senator.
Chair recognizes senator from the 37th
for a question.
>> Does senator yield?
>> Certainly from my good co-senator of
Barto County.
>> I appreciate that. Uh, as you know, I
represent not only Barto County but
parts of Cobb County as well. Um, a big
issue I'm hearing from my constituents
is housing affordability and
predictability and stability. Um, we
heard some discussion earlier about, you
know, cost of insurance going up. Um,
lots of things are coming at our
constituents. Isn't it true this bill
gives certainty and predictability in
the overall cost of your home that
wouldn't exist without this bill?
>> Correct. In your in your home, the
maximum they can increase it is the rate
of inflation instead of the assessments
that have gone up sometimes $100,000 on
homes and people get massive tax
increases that they didn't budget for.
And in many cases with some of the
seniors um they um are on fixed incomes
and it's certainly affecting their
ability to stay in their home. Does
gentleman further you
>> certainly um I represent a county that's
got a a large school district. Um you
know our school district's budgets
round about a billion dollars in scale
and scope in Cobb County. We've got more
than 100,000 students. Um I talked to my
school district. Um this is going to
have an impact on revenue on our school
district. um per year potentially $14
million. Um
but isn't it true that relative to a
billion dollar budget, a 14 mill if you
have a billion dollar budget, you have a
$14 million fiscal impact, isn't that a
relatively low fiscal impact for a
school district that scale when you
balance that against the impact it has
of predictability and stability for
homeowners?
>> It is. We we've seen that in in Floyd
County where we've had the free zone
since 2002. It's not that big of an
impact. Um in addition, all the property
other than home owners which still goes
up the rate of inflation. It just
doesn't go up more than inflation. All
the other property is unchecked and
there is a millage rate though u I found
a lot of them would much rather have a
backdoor tax increase than raise the
millage rate.
>> Does general yield for one further
question?
>> Certainly. Um, so as a as a lawmaker
from a constituency such as ours, if
we've got a very strong commercial base,
is as Cobb County does, there's a very
strong commercial tax base. Um, that's
going to continue to grow in a very
healthy way. This really only limits the
costs on homeowners. So conceivably if
our commercial digest continues to grow
in a healthy way, there may be almost
a very very little fiscal impact, but
it's really only businesses that are
covering that and commercial entities,
but homeowners are locked in kind of
kept kept stable.
>> I certainly think the senator from 37
knows of which he speaks.
>> Appreciate the bill. Thank you, sir.
>> No further questions, Senator.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. And I urge
your yes vote on this bill.
Chair recognizes the senator from the
44th to speak to the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President. Um, this
legislation has a lot of great things in
it and um, certainly it's a
well-intentioned effort to help with the
affordability crisis so many of our
families are feeling in feeling in many,
many different aspects of their lives.
Um,
one concern I have that I know has been
expressed to me and maybe to some of the
rest of you by my by my constituents
is that a one-sizefits-all
is potentially not a great policy for a
state with 159 counties that are so
desperate in their population, in their
median income, whether they're even
urban or rural.
We have school systems in widely
different states of fiscal solveny as
was made extremely clear this year with
the the uh situation some of our school
system districts found themselves in.
Just to point out that they're all not
similarly situated and having sort of
more um
increased state control because that's
what it is. It's increased state control
saying you must do this when we've got
159 counties and almost uh well actually
even potentially a few more than that on
the school systems don't have that
number right at the uh tip of my tongue
um to sort of say
we are going to impose on you dually
elected
school boards dually elected local
governments a one-sizefits-all. I do
think that, you know, is something that
we should think about carefully because
the moment we're in now is not
necessarily the situation or the moment
that we will always be in. And when you
tie hands, remove flexibility, things
may not work out as well as we would
hope in the present moment.
Our counties have widely variant
economic conditions. So, it really is
not, in addition to not being
particularly
smart policy-wise to demand a blanket
condition, it also isn't necessarily
even practical or equitable.
And it does tie our local officials
hands
um in terms of how they can deal with
their own budgets and provide the fiscal
accountability that they are tasked with
providing for their constituents by
virtue of their own dyeleed positions.
So that is um my main concern about the
notion of a one-sizefits-all.
Also, I I think it bears um
repeating, you know, how we got here
because this is sort of a this is a very
speedy uh retread of a subject that we
only dealt with two years ago.
So, we had a constitutional amendment on
this uh this exact topic.
It was a compromised piece of
legislation that went before the voters
um between uh legislators here in the
building, between Democrats, between
Republicans and by all the leaders um in
this in this building and across the
state across the state. And 65% of
Georgians cast that vote based on what
was being presented to them at the time
with the ballot language.
And now,
but before anyone can catch a breath,
two years later, we're coming back to do
a little bit of a bait and switch
because this is quite different than the
enabling legislation that was present at
the time that we presented this to the
voters.
So I think from the perspective of what
we have done from a constitutional
standpoint, we should be cautious in so
swiftly undoing the bargain that was
presented to the voters a mere two years
ago.
And we all wish that
um dealing with
doing an inflationary cap restriction on
property taxes would be a big step
towards solving our housing
affordability crisis. But the reality is
it just won't be. We have got to deal
with the housing affordability crisis by
building more homes. We do not have
enough supply. We've got to stop
institutional investors
and and we need to have local
governments
be a we need local governments to permit
housing more housing projects. And that
is something that where there's
legislation pending
I know in the house and I believe also
over here legislation called the choice
act that would go much farther towards
actually leading to housing
affordability
in the supply and demand of economics in
our state. This is much more of a
talking point. Oh, we did something. But
but the something being done can have a
lot of effects that certainly just don't
aren't equitable and don't work for 159
different counties, 180, I remember the
number, 180 school systems. Um, so
meanwhile, we should really be focusing
on like real solutions that are going to
cut out a lot of the red tape that we
currently have with the that leads to
the lack of building that we really need
to see. we really need to see a lot more
build baby build and this just isn't
going to get the job done. So let's not
kid ourselves that that this will result
um in anything that's going to make a
meaningful difference in housing
affordability. So um with that, Mr.
President, happy to answer any questions
or I shall take my seat.
>> You do have questions, Senator. Um
>> thank you, Mr. President.
>> Chair recognized Senator from the 36.
>> Thank you. Does the senator yield? Yes.
To the Senator from
>> Senator. Um we I believe represent uh
the families with children in Atlanta
schools. You on the Dicab County side
and I on the Fulton side. Um, and isn't
it true that uh our school system in
Atlanta, which is one of the uh two
largest school systems in the state, I
would I would argue, uh has had to uh
conduct a a tremendous uh assessment of
how many schools can continue to be
opened. Isn't that correct?
>> That is correct. Yes. and and we've se
and we've seen uh
very close to where you live, close to
where I live, we've seen schools
shuttered uh in the plan that that the
school board in its wisdom has had to
devise uh to uh make the make the uh
finances work. Isn't that true?
>> That is true. And uh a further question
isn't it true and you may not be aware
of this given that we are in in
different counties but in the county of
uh Fulton our commercial assessment
revenues that are produced uh are lower
>> than a year ago. That's right. That's
right.
>> Yeah. The digest fell. So, how much uh
how much do we want to hobble uh public
education? Just uh how far should we go
in in in that regard? Uh and doesn't
this don't this doesn't this set of
facts lend itself to a uh the wisdom of
a decision to vote no on this bill?
You make some great points, Senator, and
there are actually a number of other
school systems in my district and I'm
sure many of our colleagues that are in
the same position with falling
enrollment and they're having to make
tough decisions. And um I think that it
it just goes to show how not all
counties are similarly situated. And
with the falling digest,
you know, we've had a a digest that's
gone way up. And part of that is because
of the lack of supply, but there are
market forces at work. And and you point
that out by saying Fulton's Digest has
actually gone down now. And it won't be
the only one, and it won't be the only
time. And so when you're in a a period
where where housing prices are falling,
that's the market correcting. And how
much do we really want to interfere with
some of these free market forces that
are important for funding services? So I
agree with you, Senator. Thank you very
much.
>> No further questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
well.
>> Chair recognized the senator from the
31st to speak to the measure.
[clears throat]
Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today
to address a fundamental disconnect
between the rhetoric we hear from our
colleagues across the aisle and their
actual voting record when it comes to
the financial well-being of Georgia
families.
Every day in this chamber, we hear about
passionate speeches about affordability,
about the cost of living, about helping
working families and meet.
When yet presented with the opportunity
to return hardearned money to Georgia
taxpayers through meaningful property
tax relief,
those same voices fall silent. Their
votes tell the real story. A story of a
political philosophy that rather see
government grow than see Georgians
fulfill the American dream.
My colleagues on the other side of the
aisle work every day and talk about
affordability.
They express concern about rising costs.
They speak very eloquently about the
struggles of working families.
They vote to maintain a system where
local governments fe no face no
meaningful constraints
on their ability to burden homeowners
with everinccreasing tax bills.
This is not mere hypocrisy. It
represents the fundamental
misunderstanding of what affordability
actually means to Georgia families.
high property taxes that do not pay a
family for the cost that they cannot
budget for at home. When the air
conditioner breaks in July, when the car
needs unexpected repairs, when medical
bills arrive, property taxes just don't
downward accommodate these realities.
Instead, they represent an inflexible,
ever growing obligation that families
must meet regardless of their
circumstances.
[snorts]
Home ownership has become been
considered the cornerstone of the
American dream. Yet, property taxation
represents something more insidious.
It's a tax on the dream itself.
Indeed, it's the very essence of the
cradle to grave government
to require citizens to continue paying
rent to the government for as long as
they own their home.
You purchase a home, you pay your
mortgage, you maintain your property,
you invest in your community, and yet
you truly never own it because failure
to pay your property taxes and the
government will come take it from you.
This is not ownership in any meaningful
sense. It's a perpetual tendency with
the government as your landlord.
Ronald Reagan understood this principle
deeply as a governor of California and
later as president. In the late 1970s as
governor, he witnessed firsthand the
property tax crisis devastating
California property owners. Property
assessments were skyrocketing and in
some cases doubling and tripling within
just a few years.
Senior citizens who had paid off their
mortgages decades earlier were being
forced from their homes because they
could not afford tax bills.
Young families were locked out of home
home ownership entirely.
The crisis reached peak in 1978 with the
patches of Proposition 13, the landmark
initiative that pro that cap property
taxes and limited assessment increases.
Governor Reagan was an enthusiastic
supporter and he declared that quote the
people had spoken the era of tax and tax
and spend and spend is over. But
Reagan's support wasn't just a political
calculation. and it reflected his deep
political and philosophical conviction
about the property relationship between
the citizens and their government. He
understood that when the government
could seize your home for failure to pay
for every increase in taxes on your home
you already owned, you weren't truly
free. You were a tenant of the state.
This understanding only deepened went
deeper during Reagan's presidency. this
relationship between taxation, freedom,
prosperity that Democrats today don't
understand and they can't sell it.
Georgia Senate Democrats believe that
just like Reagan said, quote, "Gover's
view of the economy could be summed up
in just a few simple words. If it moves,
tax it. If it moves, if it keeps moving,
move, regulate it. And if it stops
moving, subsidize it." This is a
devastating critique of the progressive
philosophy that sees government as the
engine of prosperity rather than pe than
the people themselves that are in South
Georgia or inner city Atlanta or right
down the street from here. High taxation
is not an economic problem. It's a moral
one. Every taxpayer is involuntarily
working on the part of of their
government. The question is how much can
your labor, your time in your life does
the government have a right to claim?
Taxation represents a fundamental
transfer of decision-making power from
individuals to bureaucrats.
When government can claim an unlimited
share of your income or your unlimited
portion of your property's value through
taxation,
you are not free. You're a subject and
not a citizen.
This is the vision that we must apply to
the property taxation in Georgia today.
Local governments have grown beyond
consent of the governed. They have
increased their taxpayers not through
explicit voter approval but through the
passive mechanisms of rising
assessments. They have expanded expanded
spending to match inflated revenues than
providing relief to the taxpayer.
And now some resist limitation on their
power to continue this pattern
indefinitely.
Reagan once warned us about this
rhetoric that we would hear from those
oppo that oppose tax relief. He said the
most terrifying words in the English
language. I'm from the government and
I'm here to help. When local governments
tell us you need unlimited access to
property values to quote unquote help
the community. Remember what Ronald
Reagan warned when they claim that
limiting taxes will devastate essential
services. Ask yourself, did they provide
proportionately better services when the
revenue was doubled?
Republicans focus on affordability and
that requires government committed to
doing more with less. We believe that
Georgia families, not the government
bureaucrats, are best positioned to
decide how their money is spent. We
believe that home ownership should
achieve truly achieve sustainability and
not contingent on the government's
restraint and raising taxes.
We believe local governments like
families should live within their means
and make hard choices about provide
priorities rather than simply raising
taxes to to increase revenue. The
property tax relief measure that is
before this body represents these
principles in action. It provides
meaningful constraints on automatic tax
increases while still allowing local
governments to make their case to the
voters when additional revenue is truly
necessary. It respects the needs of
local government and the rights of
taxpayers and homeowners. Mr. President,
the choice before this body is very
clear. We can continue down the path of
an everexpanding government funded by
everinccreasing taxes on Georgia
homeowners. We can allow the American
dream of home ownership to become the
elusive province of Wall Street
investors while working families are
priced out in their own communities. Or
we could choose the path of fiscal
responsibility, limited government, and
respect for the homeowner and the
taxpayer. We can insist that government
at every level can learn to do more with
less, just as everyday Georgia families
have to do. My colleagues across the
aisle speak eloquently about
affordability.
It's time for their votes to match their
rhetoric. It's time to give
Georgiaorgians their hardearned money
back. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield
the well.
>> You do have a question, Senator.
Senator's yielded the well.
Chair recognizes the senator from the
47th to speak to the measure.
Well, thank you, Mr. President. I think
all my colleagues in here know how much
I hate coming to the well talking about
legislation and what we're doing, but I
want to tell you I said the for me it's
a little bit different. Most of y'all in
here know that I I spent 20 years as as
a 10 as a city manager, 10 as a county
manager. I've also run two development
authorities for another decade.
Probably more than than most people. The
uh I understand a little bit about uh
taxes, what's going on. And you know,
for me, I agree with with uh the senator
from the 52nd, you know, when we we talk
about what's going on with people
needing relief. They've got to have some
help. You know, I always felt like, wait
a minute, do I own my home? I I paid off
my mortgage. Luckily, I'm I'm old enough
to do that. The uh but I get to pay the
uh government all the time. Now, I'm not
against po uh paying the government.
Said the and in this case, you know, the
best part about when I pay my local tax
bill, it's all local. It's people that I
get to see in the grocery stores, people
that that uh are leaders in my community
that that are setting my tax rate. But,
you know, unfortunately, they've got a
job to do, and they some of them have
very limited capacity to where they can
collect money. So, to me, the more that
I look at it, the more I look at I said,
"Okay, there's got to be a way to make
this work." The uh I hate it that that
uh I feel like I do pay rent on the
property that I've paid for uh to my
local government, but I'm glad it all
stays local. You know, one of the things
I've said and and believe me, I've I've
done about all the things you can do on
the local side of the the government,
the uh I've been lucky enough to be able
to serve in the state senate and you
know, I understand a lot better about
the state budget and what's going on.
One of the things that I'm really proud
of what's going on in Washington DC and
what's going on in AC all across America
because we have a relationship with not
only the local government, the state
government, and the federal government
and we've got to do what's right the uh
for all our citizens. I guarantee you
every one of your constituents is paying
taxes to a city or a county or both and
you can't get away with that. Said
they're also my constituents. Uh and to
me we live in a great country. It's one
of those things. Taxes are a necessary
evil. Now, I want to share with you and
and it's one of those things that for
me,
I don't know, some of y'all read read
all the emails that come to you. I I try
to read every email that I get, and I
had a constituent send me an email
Sunday. I was reading it. The uh
unfortunately, he he attached a a word
document. Then I don't just open a word
document from somebody I don't know. So
I texted him back or emailed him back
and said, "Hey, would you send that to
me so that I can read it without opening
up on a thing just because we live in a
virus field world?" Pretty sad state of
things. But this this uh email was from
investigator Sean Allen Parton. They uh
he's a constituent of mine, lives over
outside of Comr, Georgia. they uh you
know he goes on and and it's it's kind
of a lengthy the uh four-page document.
They uh but he goes on and tells me a
little bit about him and and what's
going on in his world. He talked about
in and uh uh he always wanted to be in
law enforcement. He said the his first
experience there was he was a ranger at
Stone Mountain Park. They uh eventually
he went to work for Newton County
actually as a ditch digger. Worked in
their their water uh system. the uh from
there he got an opportunity in Okone
County to to be a jailer the uh for the
sheriff uh back in 2000. He went on to
the uh police academy, graduated and
became a sheriff's deputy the uh there
in in Okon County for several years.
Fast forward today, he's an investigator
for the Jackson County Solicitor
General's Office. Reason I bring you
this is but not because of him but
because we all have our lives. And to
me, one of the things that that he goes
on to talk about is his daughter Briana.
His his daughter he he he got a uh phone
call from
one of the medics in the fire department
that said they uh uh they they received
a call from his granddaughter. They uh
she was six. They uh
my mom's unresponsive. What? I don't
know what to do. My mom can't do
anything. She's she had and and I'm
going to share this cuz he told me I
could. They uh he said that that uh his
daughter was hypoglycemic. Any of y'all
that are that are diabetics and know
what that means? They you go into shock
in that case. They had all the right
things to try to address that, but
unfortunately the technology failed. And
so for me, his daughter suffered with
the fact that she's she's now uh fully
bedridden. She has to be cared for 24
hours a day. And and he has her his home
which he built in Madison County a few
years ago. And I'm going to read this to
you because this is the important part
of the letter.
Our rainy day fund couldn't hold up to
the disastrous storm we are facing and
dwindled overnight.
any and available savings we had had
been spent. The money set aside for our
property taxes now have to make a
choice.
Use the last bit of savings we have to
pay my property taxes
which will save me from losing my home
or keep the last bit of savings we have
left held back to pay for funeral
expenses for my daughter.
This is an impossible choice we have to
make. And this is the kind of choice
that our everyday citizens are looking
at. They uh nobody has a crystal ball.
Only God can tell how long his daughter
will live. But he goes on in the letter
to say, "My tax bill was due 12205.
I've already received letters from the
county threatening action regarding my
30-day delinquency.
Taxes are real. I understand the need
for taxes. I think everybody in here
does.
To me, we want to make them as as plain
and simple as we can be. Doing something
like passing this measure that Senator
from the 52nd has brought to us is going
to do that. And this is where I'll ask
you to vote favorably on the measure to
to let make sure that every one of our
Georgia citizens understands we feel
their pain. We know what's going on and
we want to try to make it as open and
honest as we can. Thanks for your time.
The I'll yield the well.
Chair recognizes the senator from the
54th to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President. Um, my
friends, I uh
you hear these kind of things go back
and forth and you just think, who are we
working for?
Because, you know, all we're the the
purpose of this is, you know, in the
1980s
when I graduated high school in 1982,
the average age of a firsttime homeowner
was in their 20s.
By the time we got to the year 2000, now
it's in the early 30s.
You know what's the average age of
firsttime home home ownership is in
Georgia right now? It's 40 years old.
40 years old. Because first time, my son
is one of those
first time young people just starting
out, maybe as a new married couple. They
can't afford
what's happening in the inflation of our
home market
for that first time starting out. Then
on the other end, you have the elderly.
I mean, we are literally have been when
the times got tough a couple years ago.
We're literally watching elderly people
who get these. They might have bought
the house. An a couple bought a house in
1979.
They didn't never move.
They grew old in that house. They grew
had their grandkids in that house. Now
you've got one of them has passed on.
So now there's a single widow
who still lives in that house that they
bought with a modest means years ago,
but now they get a property tax
assessment that says their home is worth
$400 to $500,000.
That elderly person has but one option.
I've got to sell my house.
I've got to move out.
Forget the grandkids getting to keep the
property.
Forget forget to keep the property that
was in our in our namesake. Forget all
that. It's got to go because I I got to
have somewhere to live. And the
government that says they're going to
take care of me is literally the one
that's putting me out of my home.
That's what this is about. We're not
trying to
railroad something through. We're just
trying to make sure we're taking care of
those on the front end and those on the
back end with home ownership
because I'm sorry, but you know, when
you can't take care of those who are in
need of care,
that says a whole lot about a society.
Says a whole lot about society that
won't care for those who need care.
And when we're not doing everything we
can to make sure that future generations
have access to home ownership because
that was the quintessential American
dream. That was the cornerstone of the
American dream was home ownership.
Now you have to wait till you're 40
years old in 2025
to get access to that American dream.
That's all this is about.
So, let's just make sure that we're
doing everything we can to cap the ones
that are out of control. That's all this
was ever about is making sure that we're
not There are some entities that they
literally Let's Let's be honest, there
are some communities they were going to
put local ordinances in place for home
new home development.
And by the time they put those new
ordinances in place for that new home
development, we're talking about half
million dollar homes.
So they're literally assessing these
properties so high that that
they're going to drive off the people in
the middle class.
They're going to drive off those people
who can't afford that first time home.
All we're doing is trying to make sure
that we're keeping the field the playing
field fair for both the young and the
old and everybody in between. That's all
this bill does.
So I would encourage everyone to please
vote for this. Let's help those on the
young those young people that are first
try homeowners and let's he help the
elderly keep the homestead that they've
had in their home for maybe 60 years
and not have to have a widow woman have
to give up her her family's home because
she can't afford the tax man's bill. Mr.
President, I I yield well. Thank you.
Chair recognizes a senator from the
second to speak to the bill.
Nice sports coat. I like it. Well, thank
you, Mr. President. and I
did not plan to take to the well today,
but since my colleagues have talked
about the issues with affordability and
folks owning a home, I want to talk
about the folks that can't even buy a
home. I want to talk about the state
minimum wage in the state of Georgia
that's $5.15.
I want to talk about the corporate
welfare that we hand out. I want to talk
about how we've cut the corporate income
tax rate before we've cut the personal
income tax rate if we were serious about
it. I want to talk about the cost of
living and how much groceries cost. I
want to talk about the senator from the
28th had legislation to talk about how
do we address the ever growing
population of corporations that go up on
the rent three to five times the amount
and what folks may make. Uh we could
talk about payment source
discrimination. We could talk about HOAs
and POAS and how they have taken folks
property. Uh but we want to address
property taxes. It's easy to go after
local government because we can't go
after uh the big corporate bailout that
we gave. The same way I came to this
well last year and I talked about to
reform the bailout for insurance
companies. We're good at doing one thing
and saying another. If we truly wanted
to help the lowest common denominator,
Matthew 25 says, "When I was hungry, you
fed me. When I was naked, you clothed
me. When I was in prison, you came and
ministered to me." And when asked when
when did you do all these things to
Jesus? He said, "When you've done it to
the least of these, you've also done it
to me." Then we would absolutely fund
and make sure the children had summer
lunch programs and folks weren't hungry.
We would make sure that there weren't
any homeless folks sitting on a $14
billion surplus. Because if we truly
wanted to help the least of these among
us, we have the power through a budget
to appropriate it and do something about
it if we were serious about it.
Now, the question becomes, where does
our moral compass actually lie? Because
if we wanted to make sure the folks did
not lose their homes for property taxes,
then I would have saw a bill to make
sure that family in spart of Georgia
wanted to keep their property. So the
railroad didn't come through. We didn't
talk about them folks. We pick and
choose what we want to come and discuss
in this. Well, now we want to talk about
affordability. Well, the Georgia Senate
Democratic Caucus has been talking about
affordability. We've been talking about
raising a minimum wage. We've been
talking about an earned income tax
credit. We've been talking about fixing
this child care issue that we have in
our state. You're talking about home
ownership. Well, some folks can't even
own a home because they're paying child
care that cost just as much as a
mortgage payment. If we're serious about
it, we would address the things that
folks are actually uh dealing with
because many of my folks aren't even
homeowners. They're renters.
So, they're paying double and triple the
taxes because they're renting the
property. So, what are we going to do to
help renters to stay in the homes that
they're renting?
How are we going to address those issues
with affordability? Because everybody is
not a homeowner. Are we going to end the
loophole where you can depreciate an
appreciating asset where if you own
multiple divisions of property, you
don't get all of these tax uh deductions
and incentives? Are we going to do
something about that? We're talking
about cutting property taxes. Well,
let's make sure we can end the deduction
where if you got multiple properties,
you can't depreciate them. Let's do
that. Let's get serious about it.
Let's not come and talk about we're
going to cut taxes in the local
community because guess what? The trash
man is in somebody's community. The
police officer is in somebody's
community. Their essential services that
government funds and they rely on
property taxes to do it. And guess what?
If you cut PROPERTY TAXES, YOU MAY NOT
HAVE THE BASE of sales tax to absorb all
of this. And this is not a one-t take
Jake a one-sizefits-all because what
works in North Georgia doesn't work in
South Georgia. And I keep saying that
every time I come to the well, just
because it works for the folks in the
more metro areas, it does not work for
the folks in the more southern part of
the state because folks want to see the
road get paid. They want to see the
sidewalk get fixed. They want to see
these things happen. Well, the only way
that that happen is somebody got to pay
the concrete man. Somebody got to pay
the street paving man. Somebody got to
pay the trash man, the firewoman, the
police woman, all of those things. And
nobody uh ever thinks about, well, you
know what, I may need insurance until
you get sick or hurt. That's when you
think about insurance. You don't think I
need these services from government
until you pick up the phone and say,
"Somebody should do something about
that." Oh, who's that going to be?
That's going to be government. So, if we
really want to address the issues with
affordability, we wouldn't just be
coming out in this budget with
needs-based aid either. We would have
been doing that. If we were serious
about it, we would address child care.
If we were serious about it, we'd
address the income inequality. We'd
address uh the healthc care inequality
that we face as a state. If we were
serious about it, we would have expanded
Medicaid by now to ensure that working
folks had healthcare. So, if we want to
BE SERIOUS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, COME
TALK TO ME. WE'VE GOT A slew of bills
that the Democratic caucus has put
together, and I would h be more than
happy to have you co-sign on any of
these pieces of legislation so we can
actually do something about
affordability. Now, if we want to work
together on this, colleagues, we can do
that in a bipartisan effort, but just
don't come and just say this is exactly
what it is and expect me to vote yes. If
you want to work with us, we'll work
with you. Come talk to us and we'll find
a way to do it together. But if you want
to have a top- down approach, then guess
what? That's what this will be. But if
we're gonna talk about affordability,
don't come and give me a vain speech
about affordability when we've been
talking about it for a while. You just
talking about affordability because you
done lost a few elections. So with that,
Mr. President, I yield the whale.
>> Hey, Senator, you have several
questions.
>> Sadly, the senator has yielded the
whale.
>> All right. [snorts]
Chair recognizes my neighbor, the
senator from the 13th to speak to the
measure.
>> Hey, Mr. President.
Okay, guys. I think we all can agree we
don't like taxes.
Nobody in this room wants taxes higher.
I doubt anybody in this room really
wants to pay their taxes. But the
reality of it is taxes are taxes. You
know, it's an ugly word. Here's the
problem, and I'm going to take blame for
this. I made a mistake. I voted for this
bill last year when it had an opt- out
clause in it. And I knew better.
I knew dang well that bill we should
have never we should have stood our
ground here in the Senate, sent it back
to the House and not have an opt- out
clause in it because we knew darn well
what was going to happen is open up
Pandora's box. Hello, she's here.
Where we at right now is can we make a
difference? Can we help communities?
Well, I can tell you right now I can
echo this what several of the senators
have said about people in their
communities. We got people this. I got a
lady 80 years old in my community. 82
actually. She inherited her house from
her mother like 40 years ago, 45 years
ago. She's been in there just all this
long. It on the lake in our community,
which has now become, you know, this
destination spot like all water
properties do. And her taxes used to be
like $800 a year. Now there's 7 to
12,000 depending on what because all the
houses around her are selling for $500
to $700,000.
We have to do something. We have to put
this bill in place. I'm for this bill to
where there's not an opt out. I'm for
this bill because I know I have talked
to my commissioners and my and my tax
people in my community and they're
telling me this bill will help people.
That's all I care about. This bill will
help people. That's what we're here for,
guys. We're arguing all the time about
who's going who's got the bigger pencil
in this room here. Okay? I The reality
of it is is I don't care.
I'm here to help people.
I'm here to help people. And that's what
we should be that's what we should be
focused on. And I do believe this bill
is
really right. Now, is any bill 100%
perfect? I doubt it. But this bill is
really getting close to being right and
putting a bill in place that will help
people. And folks, that's what we need
to be doing. I ask for your favorable
consent on this bill to help these 80s
something year old people get their
taxes down where they can afford to live
and not have to sell their home and move
into some other whatever because of the
taxes that's being created across this
state.
Mr. President, I yield well.
>> Senators yield the well. Chair
recognized Senator from the 37th to
speak for the measure.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the
Senate, I'm going to reach out to
regular Georgians and explain what this
bill's doing in plain terms. And I sh I
share this in the spirit of of
bipartisan outreach. Uh I believe
members uh of the Democrat caucus would
be well advised to support this because
I think it's good for your constituents.
I think this is simply and plainly good
policy and I this this is what I would
share and I'd really share to Georgians
who are listening to this debate. What
this bill does is is with respect to
property taxes.
You've got homestead properties where
people live in their own home and then
you have every other form of property.
every other form of property and the
value and the taxes assessed on that can
rise with the market without any
limitation under this bill. So if you
live in a community that's got
commercial buildings, you've got a
manufacturing plant, you've got a
warehouse, you got a data center,
whatever you have in your community
that's commercial, those values will
continue to rise as the market
assessment rises without any limitation
and all those dollars pour into the
government coffers as they always have.
Any property in your community that is
not owner occupied, even homes, if you
have have landlords, landlords, their
properties are going to continue to rise
with market values, and the governments
that are being talked about here will
still get their revenues.
This bill only deals with that subset of
property, 25 to 30% of the property
value in my counties, just a very small
fraction.
And that 25 to 30% of the properties can
still increase in value and the tax
revenue can still go up every year. But
that increase is limited to the rate of
inflation.
friends, where else do you get that deal
that you get a guaranteed increase the
rate of inflation
for yourself
um and for 25 to 30% of the properties
and everything else is unlimited in the
in the increase in and the revenue that
can come in from other properties.
That's a really really good deal because
you know what governments are not going
to be significantly impacted by this
revenue-wise
because at the end of the day you know
what you know what governments always
have the power to do? They've got the
power of taxation. They can set their
tax rates however they want to. This
doesn't take any ability for governments
to set tax rates. All this does is it
says the assessed value on 25 or 30% of
all the land in your in your community
can still go up but go up the rate of
inflation. Friends, that is a very very
small impact on government's ability to
tax.
But you know what that is? That is a
significant impact for homeowner
predictability and certainty to be able
to stay in their homes.
There's a lot of words that are thrown
around this well. a lot of distractions
we've heard today in this debate, but
I'm talking to my friends in the
Democrat caucus. I want you to join your
Republican colleagues and support this
proposition because the powers to tax in
our governments are still very very
significant across the entire commercial
property base and they can still go up
at the rate of inflation for the
residential homes 20 or five 20 25 30%
of the land value your communities.
Government can still see increases in
those values go up at that rate.
Government still controls the keys.
But what's important is there's nothing
this Senate has voted on in my time in
this Senate that's had a bigger impact
on housing affordability for regular
people. Not concepts, not down the road,
not setting conditions, not a big broad
bill, but specific impact for homeowners
to give them affordability,
predictability, and stability of the
overall cost of their homes than this
proposition.
I say that with hopes that members of
both parties can support this. And
whether you're Republican or whether
you're a Democrat, if you understand
these issues and you think about the
details and you're representing your
constituents, this is a very easy vote
to make. and hope our Democrat
colleagues will join us in supporting
this proposition. Thank you, Mr.
President.
>> Chair recognizes the minority leader to
speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief.
One of the reasons why we're here, the
reason why we're even here is because we
actually did have a compromise between
the two parties, between the two parties
here late at night to actually be able
to send this to the voters. actually
brought Democrats and Republicans to the
table to where we actually had to work
through these particular issues and we
actually had an opportunity to influence
that legislation and then we were able
to take it to our voters and where after
hearings our voters then made a
determination
that was actually real working together.
Now though, because we only need a
majority vote, we now today have decided
we're about to basically scuttle all of
that and determine what local
communities may have decided is wrong.
What we decided that night when we
actually did have a compromise, we
actually did work together was wrong
only because now it only takes majority.
That is very interesting. But we should
not be lectured to as good friend from
the senator from SEG was saying as far
as who cares about whom. Very
interesting thing. Georgia just recently
applied for the rural health
transformation program program coming
out of the uh president's office. In
that application, rural health. In that
application, it stated that Georgia's
rural community suffers from higher
poverty rates. Had to say that to be
able to get the money. That's an
application from the governor's office
of governor of Georgia. How is anybody
going to lecture us when many persons in
this room represents rural communities
and you refuse to actually expand
Medicaid? where you refuse to do ACA tax
credits, ACA credits as far as for the
state. How is you going to lecture us
when your own communities by your
governor as it applies for funds says
that rural communities is suffering from
poverty? That's not a Democrat saying
that. That's the state of Georgia saying
that to get money. You know what your
communities suffer, but you're going to
come in here and lecture us that we
don't care about our communities because
we won't pass something that as
basically is redinking on something that
we agreed on. But yet you have not done
something as far as Medicaid is
concerned, as far as healthcare is
concerned, but yet the state
acknowledges that those communities are
suffering from poverty. How is anyone
going to lecture us when those same
communities when many people realize
that you would destroy your public
schools have actually said those things
that you destroy your own public
schools, but yet you vote for vouchers
and allow those schools to be destroyed,
but going to come in here and lecture us
about who cares and doesn't care about
their communities. when you actually can
admit and say that these things are
actually going to happen but actually
still vote against the interest of your
particular community. So we're not going
to take any lecturing. We were at the
table before we came to this compromise
and now because it only takes a majority
the compromise goes away and we're
supposed to go back to our communities
and say even though you guys wanted this
many of your communities have actually
opted out of this even though this is
what you wanted after hearing after
hearing hours after hours discussions we
had debates all over the place in
Augusta we you were wrong and the
Republican majority is right now but
don't come in here and lecture us about
who cares about what I could go through
the same mechanics that senator from the
second talked about as far as all the
things when you start talking about
higher cost as far as rent is concerned.
We have a bill that's been presented by
the senator from the 28th to talk about
giving the counties the option of even
having local rent control that can't
even come up for a hearing.
So there's going to be no lecturing
today. We ought to vote this bill down
because what the people decided just two
years ago as far as a real compromise
and bringing us to the table as
Democrats was real. Now what's basically
happened is trying to give us a lecture
and say you better do what we say at at
this particular point in time. And we're
not going to go for that. We're not
going to take lectures from somebody
when the own state of Georgia says that
many of your communities live in poverty
and you won't even help them without a
yield. The well
senators yield the well. Chair
recognizes senator from the 31st.
He waves. Chair recognizes the senator
from the 27th to speak to the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in
support of this bill. I can think of a
lot of forms of taxes. income taxes,
sales taxes, capital gains taxes, death
taxes, emissions taxes, gasoline taxes,
road taxes, tolls.
But in my mind, none of them are nearly
as unamerican
as property taxes.
And all that this bill is saying is that
we're going to do the exact same thing
to government
that American families have to do. And
that is live within your means. We just
cap the rate of their increases at the
rate of inflation.
That's it.
Because what's been happening without
this bill and what will continue to
happen without this bill is there will
be no upside limit on how much a family
can be taxed to stay in their own home
year-over-year. Not because they made
money, not because they sold a stock or
got a promotion or did anything else,
but because their neighbor sold their
house for more money. and you wake up
one day and you get an envelope in the
mail and all of a sudden you're looking
at a 25% increase in your property taxes
over last year and the politicians,
they get to sit back and say, "Well, I
didn't raise your taxes. I didn't raise
your millage rate. Your neighbor sold
their house for more money.
Congratulations. Send us a couple
thousand extra dollars and we will say
that we didn't raise your taxes." Well,
the charade is up. People have realized
that the tax digest doesn't magically
create the exact amount of money every
single year that cities, counties, or
school boards need to run their
government. And sadly, most of these
local governments have not rolled back
their millage rate in years of
double-digit inflation. Now, the irony
of the push back from the from the
minority party on this, of course, is
that two years ago, all but seven
Democrats voted for this exact language.
It wasn't a compromise in this chamber.
It was a compromise across the hall. And
the opt- out language we have realized
from our constituents who are continuing
to get the double-digit increases is
something they just can't handle
anymore.
And so there's been a lot of dialogue
about well increase housing supply,
bring down regulation. We can do all of
that and we should look at doing a lot
of those things. But not one of those
things will help my in-laws who are in
their 70s are looking to retire and
can't retire because their property
taxes have gone up year after year after
year in the home that they've lived in
for 30 years. So this is not something
that just kind of we can think about in
terms of well we can just push this
aside and increase housing supply and
it'll solve the problem. It won't solve
the problem. Property taxes are the only
place that I can think of in the entire
American economy and certainly within
the Georgia tax code where we tax
unrealized gain. It's unjust. It's
unfair. This gets us into a posture
where we don't solve the problem. The
ultimate solution here really is to get
rid of property taxes altogether. All
that this does though is as a temporary
step to say that the d the days of
doubledigit property tax increases need
to end. And Mr. President, I'm happy to
stand with the party that is in that
posture today. And with that, I'll yield
the well.
>> Senators yielded the whale. Uh chair
will recognize the senator from the
second
>> parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Mr.
President,
>> state your inquiry.
>> Mr. President, does the majority party
have a bill to end the development
authorities ability to give property tax
abatements and its legislative
priorities?
>> That's a question each and every senator
will have to answer for themselves.
>> Chair recognizes the senator from the
27th.
>> Parliamentary inquiry.
>> State your inquiry. Mr. President, is it
not true that one can abolish a local
development authority if they wish by
dropping local legislation?

>> State your inquiry.
>> Mr. President, isn't true that I'm going
to purchase for the majority leader a
little bell that he can ding anytime a
candidate for statewide office speaks in
the chamber?
>> That That's an excellent idea.
kind of reminds me of the rules
chairman's bill.
Maybe we could get the same making
model. Okay. Chair recognizes the
senator from the 35th
to speak to the measure. And just so you
know, I think I will offer the senator
from the 52nd an opportunity to close
debate after this. I hope.
>> All right. Thank you, Mr. the president.
I really appreciated the debate on the
floor um today. I wanted to just give
y'all a few numbers. Uh during the c
during the campaign trail, as I'm newly
a state senator, uh I made a promise to
myself to make sure I'm still spending
hours talking to everyday folks from
District 35. And this past Saturday,
while we're all uh iced in and snowed
in, I got a chance to take a couple
hours and just call voters.
And a familiar conversation came up. And
I was talking to a woman who was not
quite old enough to take the senior
exemption, but not making quite enough
to keep up with everything going on with
her her property taxes. Uh we had a
really long conversation. Let me just
share some numbers with you. And I see
many of you are have your calculators
out um on your calculator app. From 22
to 23 u her property taxes rose
$119.
From uh 22, excuse me, from 2023 to 24,
her property taxes went up $489.
From 2024 to 2025, her property taxes
have increased by $1,013.
This woman was in tears,
saying, "Do something."
It didn't feel appropriate at the time
to say, "Well, Republican strategy is
this and Democratic strategy is that."
There there has to be some kind of
boiling point where it says the strategy
of this state is to do
something
that our solution the scale of our
solution needs to match the scale of the
problem.
I don't think this solution is great.
It's okay. It's something.
But it's not enough.
And just like you, I've been in plenty
of presentations where somebody is
telling you what they're doing in their
organization and they have a bullet
point saying we're doing this for
literary, this for this. But you know,
well, it sounds good, but the scale of
the solution is nowhere near to the
scale of the problem.
If we're going to be honest about having
this unpredictable rates when it comes
to property values, I am assuming that
this body is going to have that same
passion with the unpredictable rates
when it comes to car insurance,
the unpredictable rates when it comes to
health insurance. I hope that we're not
going to just bore down into our little
rabbit holes and our silos when it comes
to other areas of affordability.
This is one step,
but it's like medicine.
If you take an antibiotic for a day, for
a partial dose for one day, it's not
going to do anything. That antibiotic
got to be at full strength for 10 days
if you want that thing gone. And those
of you who've been through some
situations, you know, you take the right
medicine for the right dose and for the
right length of time. The scale of the
solution has to match the scale of the
problem.
It is my prayer.
It is my prayer that this body
will take seriously
the full scale of the solution.
I am looking forward to just as a robust
debate when it comes to our other
unpredictable
costs. I'm a small business owner. I
need to be able to predict what's coming
the best I can
with my few employees.
They're depending on me to make good
decisions to plan for the future.
I'm looking forward to this body
taking affordability seriously and not
just take, you know, putting a dollar in
our front pocket while we
take $5 out your back pocket.
I yield the will.
>> Chair recognizes the senator from the
52nd to close debate.
Thank you, Mr. President. Um, I hate
that we got off on a lot of other issues
here today. I do try to work as always
in a bipartisan manner. Um,
I've heard local control,
but I know I've got citizens totally
outraged
all over the place about this. We've got
the lady who got her social security
cost increase of 2.8%.
And this asks the local governments to
do the same 2.8% but not even that
restrictive just on the minority of the
property that's homeowner. Stick to that
2.8% for that lady and do it. Um
the capital gains brought up by the
senator from the 27th, you know,
reminded me that a lot of people look at
this as they're being taxed on an
unrealized gain and feel that's unfair.
They haven't got the money from the
capital gains, but they're being taxed
on it. Um, this was
also the senator from the second talking
about corporate welfare. I think nobody
has fought corporate welfare any more
than I have. I look for not spending
unnecessary money that we should and
I'll continue to do that. That's not in
this bill. That's a different issue, but
I don't disagree with him on that.
um
the senators of the
and and I do think this was a compromise
last year. I don't feel like it was any
different. The senators from the 36 that
talked, the 42nd and the second all
two years ago on our Senate Bill 349
that had no opt out in it voted for that
with us. We worked on it together. I
didn't think I was springing anything
new on there. I didn't think it would
work. The opt out was between the House
and the Senate. We disagreed with them.
It was the last day. It was a 30%
solution. It took care of the 30% of the
people who didn't have those governments
opt out, the other 70%. So, some people
got the advantage. We've seen others not
get it. And we've seen over a few years
some increases of different counties. I
won't call them out of 62% 95% 85%
77% 73% people getting taxed out of
their homes. We've got to take care of
these people. Um,
I think this measure puts us back to
what we all voted for two years ago. The
citizens approved it and too many local
governments took advantage of the opt
out and said we don't want any control
and the citizens are crying for help all
over the state. Does this solve all the
problems in the state? Absolutely not.
but it will help those homeowners
perhaps stay in their home and not get
these outrageous increases.
So, I would urge everyone here to vote
for affordability
for our homeowners in Georgia. Mr.
President, I yield to well.
The question is on the adoption of the
committee substitute. Is there objection
to the adoption of the committee
substitute? Hearing none, the committee
substitute is adopted.
Is there objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which favorable
to the passage of the bill? The chair
has none. The report of the committee is
agreed to. Is there objection to the
main question being ordered? The chair
hears none and the main question is
ordered. The question is on the passage
of the bill by substitute. All those in
favor of the bill will vote yay.
Opposed? Nay. The secretary will unlock
the machine. [bell]
On the passage of the bill, the yays are
31, the nays are 19. This bill, having
received the requisite constitutional
majority, is therefore passed by
substitute
senator from the 19th. What's what
purpose do you rise?
>> Mr. Mr. President, I ask unanimous
consent that we transmit that bill to
the House.
>> The senators asked for unanimous consent
that Senate Bill 382 be immediately
transmitted to the House. Is there
>> Okay.
[clears throat]
Uh
Senator from 19th, what purpose do you
rise?
>> Hold our objection.
>> Okay, we do have an objection. Um y'all
want to put it on the board?
All right.
>> All those in favor will vote yay. Those
opposed, vote nay. The secretary will
unlock the machine.
All right. On the motion to ad
immediately transmit Senate Bill 382 to
the House, the yays are 30, the nays are
20. The motion fails.
Oh my gosh. This is um something we've
been looking forward to. Uh chair
recognizes the sen senator from 31st.
What purpose do you rise?
>> Mr. President, after we just passed the
bill that address affordability in
Georgia, I move that the Senate stand
adjourned till 10:00 a.m. Wednesday,
February 4th, 2026.
>> Secretary read the announcements.
