before we uh I'll give you just a minute
before we take the roll call vote this
morning I want to
address an issue
that has occurred in our state and the
pastor
Dr yarber is going to speak directly to
it as well
but all of you all are aware of this but
as we convene this morning we know that
several communities around our state
were impacted by severe severe weather
over the weekend
there's significant damage in troop
Meriwether and Baldwin counties
while there are reports of injuries in
those candidates we yet we don't yet
have any report or fatalities reported
and we certainly all pray that remains
the case
now
we know our friends in the state of
Mississippi
we're not so fortunate this weekend and
we pray for all of them as well
devastating losses
here at home Governor Camp has declared
a state of emergency
all and I mean all of our state's
resources are being made available to
help with this cleanup and take care of
those impacted
may the good Lord
bless those who were impacted with the
and those are helping in the recovery
effort this weekend and this week as
time moves forward and as we remember
those in Mississippi that have suffered
a lot suffered loss and are all about
rebuilding their lives from this
Devastation if you will bow with me for
a moment of silence

as is our custom we will begin our day
with scripture reading and Prayer by the
chaplain after which we will pledge
allegiance to the flag of our country
now our chaplain this morning will be
introduced by the gentleman from the
10th house District representative
Victor Anderson representative Anderson
thank you Mr Speaker
it's an honor this morning to represent
my friend
and to introduce my friend Dr John
Yarborough
to this house
you know how do you introduce a man who
has so many accolades it's impressive
that he's a graduate of true McConnell
University Mercer University the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
and holds a Doctrine Divinity from
Southern California Theological Seminary
it's important that he's pastored many
churches he's
currently or he has served as the vice
president of the North American Mission
board for the Southern Baptist
convention and he's currently the a
director and Adjunct professor professor
for Truitt McConnell University
it's impactful
that he was one of 60 spiritual leaders
invited by President George W bush
following the 9 11 attack
to discuss the spiritual impact of that
terrorist attack on our nation
it's probably most impressive
that he's been married to his beautiful
wife Diana
for 54 years they have two children and
four grandchildren
but none of those things are the most
important thing that I can say about Dr
John Yarborough the most important thing
that I can say and with this I'll
introduce you to Dr John Yarbrough is
that he is a man after God's Own Heart
Dr Arbor
welcome sir
thank you representative Anderson and
thank you speaker
it is an honor to stand before this
August body of
who's whose
for each of you are a who's who in the
district that has elected you to sit in
the seat that you sit in
and given you that responsibility
and I don't know about you but every
time I walk into this building
I'm so impressed as I walk through the
gallery and I
see the
portraits of the who's who's
that have affected our nation and our
state
and then when we get to some of the more
modern ones the ones that I've had the
privilege to know and be impacted by
I feel like I'm not a who's who but I'm
a who's he
I've been the bathroom break on major
conferences all over the world
when you've got Charles Stanley
and David Jeremiah
and John Yarbrough when are you going to
go to the bathroom
but you know what as I look in the Bible
while I see the gallery of the who's who
the Moses the Abrahams
the David you remember David was a who's
he
till he faced Goliath
and became a who's who
and then John
and Peter
and Paul who you remember he was a who's
who
with the religious leaders in Israel
until he had an encounter with Jesus on
the way to Damascus
and he became a who's he to them
but a who's who to the early church and
ended up writing half of our new
testament
I want to take you just for a moment
because I've become intrigued with as a
who's he
he's in the Bible
and I'm just going to lift up two very
quickly
very quickly this morning
one is in Judges chapter 3 verse 31.
this is the only verse he has in the
Bible but by the way he does have a
verse in the Bible
and it says this
and after him came shemgar
the son of Athen
who struck down 600 Philistines with an
ox goad
and he saved Israel
now I'd say probably over 2500 years ago
he was a who's who he was the third
judge
ruling over the nation of Israel before
they had a king
but he was willing to do what he could
with what he had where he was while he
was there
my prayer is that God would raise up
Among Us
a legion of shimgars to do what we can
with what we've got where we are while
we're here
because you see that Arts gold I'm not
much of an agricultural expert
but I had to research a little bit what
was he holding it wasn't an instrument
of War it was an instrument that you
would use to Pride The Oxen with
and then on the other end it had a flat
place where you would scrape the mud off
the plow
and yet
he took what he had and used it to do
what he could and he saved Israel
and it's time
but then the second guy and this is the
only other guy I'll cover with you today
it's your mom
and Shema was one of David's three
Mighty Men
and it says in
second Samuel the third chapter
now after him was Shema the son of A.G
the hairite and the Philistines were
gathered into a troop where there was a
plot of ground full of lentils and as a
Georgia Boy
he was standing in a pee patch
and the people fled from the Philistines
everybody ran but Shema
but he took his stand in the midst of
the plot defended it and struck down the
Philistines and the Lord brought about a
great victory
I want you to just real quickly when he
stood where he stood and why he stood
when he stood at the moment of crisis
when somebody needed to do something
everybody else was running but he stood
where he stood
in the middle of the P patch
in the midst it says everybody could see
him you guys there's some things worth
standing for amen
and sometimes you have to stand alone
if nobody's willing to stand with you
you need to stand alone
but I want you to understand he wasn't
alone
because why he stood it was God's P
patch
and it said and the lord gave the
victory
now when you're standing if you're
standing with the Lord
you're never alone
and you make a majority
when it's you and him
let's pray together
father God I pray for these men and
women and the awesome responsibilities
you've given them
I know that this week they have
long days in front of them
and major decisions
I pray that you will grant them wisdom
I pray that you will grant them courage
I will pray that you grant them the
ability to stand in the midst
on issues we're standing for to protect
and defend this state
and father as we pray as we've already
mentioned we pray for those who deal
with disaster
for those families that are grieving the
loss of loved ones
for those who are having to rebuild
their lives their homes their businesses
we pray for First Responders
we pray for civic and Community leaders
as they stand together to rebuild
wherever the storms were
we know father that you are there
in the midst
and will one day bring the victory
forgive us father
forgive us when we
spend so much on so little
help us to be what you want us to be and
do what you desire us to do in Jesus
name amen
pledge the flag with me if you will to
our nation
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the
Republic for which it stands one nation
under God indivisible with liberty and
justice for all amen thank you

a gentleman from down in Effingham
County chairman Bill Hitchens recognized
for a morning order
thank you very much Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker and I are really happy to
welcome a group a significant group from
Effingham County here today uh welcome
to the people's house I'd like to ask
you to stand the mayor of Rincon
councilman the chief of police our
Effingham Heroes organization and most
importantly the Gallagher family
and the reason the primary reason we're
here today is uh
back last June just before the Fourth of
July in Rincon we have what's known as a
Fourth of July parade but we call it
freedom rings
and uh on during that parade I happened
to be the Grand Marshal and I was
sitting in the cat bird seat
the chief of police led the parade the
sheriff was second and I was third and
as we were in the parade all of a sudden
I saw a car coming in the opposite
direction where all traffic had been
shut off
at first I thought it was somebody who
was just lost and made a wrong turn who
came in and uh but as he approached the
parade he didn't slow down he continued
on the chief of police swerved and tried
to block him and he went around the
chief the sheriff moved over and tried
to block him and he went right by me
I will give my friends in the third
infantry division credit the third
infantry division band was right behind
me
instruments and all of them went into
the ditch pretty rapidly as if they were
in a combat situation
but the individual continued on at high
speed there were children out there
children's dance groups it was a pretty
significant sized parade so they called
ahead and they had a fire truck try and
block the parade he turned sideways and
they went around the fire truck
and as he continued on
K-9 Officer Gallagher who's pictured in
the picture there on the right that's
the chief
officer Gallagher and his canine razor
he saw him coming he lined up with him
and in order to stop him and save life
and property he uh he hit him head on it
totaled out his SUV he was hospitalized
the officer was hospitalized and as I
understand that Razer just had to
undergo surgery here recently for the
damages that were inflicted upon him so
we wanted
officer Gallagher if you raise your hand
so we could recognize you for your Valor
and
[Applause]
[Applause]
in all honesty we wanted to do a house
resolution but we got the information
too late and the dates were full so but
welcome to the people's house and thank
you for everything you do for our
citizens in Effingham County
we thank you for those heroic actions
you saved lives thank you so much and
what you do every day for the people not
only of Rincon but for our entire State
we appreciate you
representative Danny Mathis
is recognized for a morning order
thank you Mr speaker thank you members
of the house today I come to you and I
have a resolution that I want to read to
you we have a crisis going on in this
country in this state and our local
communities it's a fentanyl crisis
and we've written this resolution it
says whereas the fentanyl epidemic is
one of the biggest threats facing the
citizens of Georgia and whereas
according to the CDC
107
375 people in the United States died of
drug overdoses and Drug poisons in the
12-month period ending in January of
2022 and 67 percent of those deaths
involve synthetic opioids like Fentanyl
and whereas from 2019 to 2021 fentanyl
overdoses deaths increased by
232 percent in Georgia alone
amongst age 10 to 19 fentanyl is
responsible for a staggering 800 percent
increase in overdose deaths during the
same time period
and whereas fentanyl is being found not
only by itself but also illegal drugs
such as methamphetamine heroin and
cocaine often causing unaware buyers to
ingest what they believe to be
methamphetamine Heron or cocaine but
instead get almost pure Fentanyl with
fatal results and whereas the drugs sold
by the criminal street gangs often
supplied by mexican-based cartels
are some of the methods for how fentanyl
is finding its way to Georgia
fentanyl is also being smuggled through
legal ports hidden amongst cargo
and whereas this rise in fentanyl in
Georgia puts law enforcement tasks with
stopping these drugs as well as First
Responders trying to save lives at risk
fentanyl exposure to law enforcement
officials is on the rise and puts their
lives in danger
from receiving an accidental overdose as
well
deployment of Knox common commonly
referred to as Narcan provides temporary
temporary protection
and opioid overdose can turn fatal in as
little as six minutes
but next lawn can reverse it almost
instantly
now therefore be it resolved by the
House of Representatives that the
members of this body strongly support
the work being done by law enforcement
agencies
across Georgia as well as their Federal
Partners to combat this crisis
Mr Speaker I'd like to thank you for
your concern and your help with this

house thank you Mr Speaker
chairman Powell and representative
representative Oliver
recognized for a morning order
thank you Mr Speaker and Ladies and
Gentlemen of the house we're here this
morning to honor
the life and the legacy of a former
House member Elliot levitis
Elliott levitta served in this house
back in the 60s and was the first Jewish
Congressman elected to the U.S Congress
now there's a lot of things I can tell
you Elliott was uh he was a graduate of
Emory in Oxford University and a Rhodes
Scholar
man of impeccable character and and as
is usual for a lot of y'all who've heard
my uh commentary about the older
legislators there used to be a character
not that you don't have character but
these folks had real character and with
that I'm going to say just to tell a
short story about Elliot when Elliot was
elected uh speaker Murphy and uh and
some of the others they were in power at
that particular time and there was a
member of this house that used to sit
right over there and his name was uh
Harry Dixon
now for a lot of you who've never heard
of Harry Dixon that he was a character
of the old school Harry was a railroad
engineer from dining Waycross and he
could tell more stories and it's a shame
that a lot of those stories weren't
recorded for the for the future but when
Elliot was elected and him being a
Rhodes scholar they were having a
meeting
trying to decide where they were going
to place committee members at that time
and then one of them speaker Murphy or
someone of them said something to Harry
about well he's a Rhodes scholar and
Harris said well he'd be perfect to be
on the transportation committee since he
knows so much about Rhodes
so that ladies and gentlemen is a little
brief story about The Honorable Elliott
levitis and a man of true character
who one of the things that he taught me
and I always lived up to it but he
always said that if you get involved in
an issue
wade into it up to your neck and don't
be afraid of it I'm going to turn it
over to my friends chairman Oliver
Congressman levitis was my constituent
through my long political career Not
only was he the only Rhodes scholar that
ever served on this floor or the senate
floor but he was also a leading
professional as a lawyer with a major
Law Firm
he was the author primary author and
sponsor of the MARTA bill when he was
here and in Congress he was noteworthy
for many important improvements for the
lives of Georgians it was an honor to
represent him and it was an honor to
know that there are professionals that
served on this body that continue their
Public Service in very important and
very significant ways God bless Elliot
levitis and his family
I knew Congressman David is and what I
knew about him best personally was he
was the only Southern congressman
to vote for the 1964 Civil Rights bill
a great man
thank you members
and his sons served honorably in this
house as well
so what a great tradition from that
family

clerk will read the caption to Senate
Bill 109 109.
Senate Bill 109 by Senator Eccles of the
49th and others to be titled an act to
amend article 7 of chapter 4 title 49 to
the official code of Georgia annotated
relating to medical assistance generally
so it's required the Department of
Community Health to include continuous
glucose monitors as a pharmacy benefit
for Medicaid recipients this bill ever
referred to the Committee on Public
Health that committee recommends that
this bill do pass
by committee substitute
cheer Lily chair lady Ballinger is
recognized to present the bill
y Bellinger
thank you Mr Speaker it's my pleasure to
present before you Senate bill 9.
the first part of Senate Bill 9 has to
do with white bagging and white bagging
kind of sounds a little bit nefarious to
me
um but it really just has to do with
insurance companies trying to get in
between providers and their patients
whenever you're a cancer patient and you
show up to get your infusion or perhaps
you're an MS patient there are lots of
conditions that are covered under this
you go you get weighed your blood
chemistry is taken in your
um your dosage is mixed up according to
your blood chemistry and your weight
you know the particular cocktail is is
mixed up right then and there and so the
insurance companies want to interfere
with this and make you have your uh
prescriptions maybe a day maybe several
days in front of your actual infusion
date so this can cause all sorts of
problems for the patient so this would
base basically prohibit that
the second section of House Bill 109
allows DCH to cover continuous glucose
monitors the patient must be diabetic
and it requires training and the patient
must use daily insulin and it must have
a an appointment with their provider in
person or via Telehealth every six
months to check on the efficacy of the
continuous glucose monitors and make
sure that they're working as they should
Mr Speaker that's the uh that's all I
have to say about Senate Bill 109 and
I'll be happy to yield to any questions
you have no questions
Mr Speaker and I urge your favorite book
you do have a question okay to your left
representative Lisa Campbell has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield the well sure yes
um
so I'm asking the question this bill
then eliminates interference between
Health Care Providers and their patients
is that correct that is correct and may
I make one more further inquiry is it
not true that my mother who is a stage
four ovarian cancer survivor who had
severe complications due to chemotherapy
certainly benefited from having close
attention and care
in the moment during her chemotherapy
treatments yes that is that is typical
of many of our cancer patients here in
the state of Georgia and we're just
trying to maintain that close
relationship between the doctor and the
patient thank you thank you for your
question
I'll yield to any other questions you
have no further questions thank you and
I urge your favorable consideration the
lady has yielded the well is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered the chair has done the previous
question is ordered is there an
objection to adopting The committee's
Substitute chair has done the
committee's substitute is adopted is

Mr clear will you read the caption to SB
146 146. Senate Bill 146 by Senator
Gucci the 51st and others to be entitled
an act to amend Article 2 of chapter 2
title 46 chapter 1 and title 10 in
Article 1 of chapter 9 the title 48 the
fish go to Georgia annotated relating
the jurisdiction of the powers and
duties of the Georgia Public Service
Commission generally this Bill had been
referred to the committee on technology
and infrastructure Innovation that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by rules committee substitute
chairman of Transportation chairman
Jasper is recognized to present the bill
well thank you Mr thank you Mr Speaker
committee members I mean committee
members house members we've seen this
before this is almost the same bill that
I brought before you a few weeks ago on
the work of The Joint Commission on the
electrification of Transportation the
bill does three things you know it
allows the sale of Power by retail by
others than Georgia power and the EMC
allows the regulation of electric
vehicle charging stations throughout the
state and the taxation on the sale of
electricity we've made a few changes
between here and there the main one
being the rate and if you look on page
if you were so inclined page 14 line 334
you see a number going from 9 to 11. and
so that works inversely that decreases
the rate that we had put in earlier the
rate for the cell of electricity the
excise tax will be
2.84 cents per kilowatt hour instead of
if it were 9 3.47
I appreciate everyone's work
especially on this I'll cross the aisle
and everywhere getting this through with
the center Gooch and the centers and all
the different committees that has a
touch on this bill the main thing it
does is it really makes sure that we
continue funding Transportation
infrastructure that's the roads and
bridges across our state if you listen
to us and transportation talk very often
that's the key thing that we've got to
work on it's something we have to work
on in the future especially with Freight
Logistics funding I look forward to
working on that Mr Speaker that's my
bill I'll be glad to answer any
questions
you do have a couple of questions to
your left representative Al Williams is
recognized for our question
thank you Mr Speaker will the gentleman
yield yes sir the clarification
there is a charging station at the
Dublin exit that's the only one I know
between my house and Atlanta yes can you
tell me what the breakdown the cost now
what did it cost to charge an average
car and what will it be after this bill
passes I don't know the dollar amount Mr
Williams but what it will do is now
you're purchasing electricity based on
time after this bill is signed you'll be
paid the effective date you'll purchase
it on the kilowatt hours sold to you so
it will be a change but it should be
similar but uh you're going to get
you're going to buy what you pay for you
can pay for what you can get what you
pay for excuse me will you yield four
dollars oh yeah are you aware do you
know if chairman Hatchet owns an
interest in that one at the Dublin exit
I didn't know that
you saw me stand up but if he did I
think it'd be even more for it I'm sure
chairman yield yes sir
another member of the Williams caucus
representing Mary Frances Williams to
your left has a question
chairman my question is this
um I think one version of this bill
prohibited uh free charging and I know a
lot of establishments offer free
charging is is that is this bill going
to to do that yes ma'am well no it won't
because if you want to do free charging
that's up to you as a business person
like you could give away Coca-Cola if
you wanted to to increase your business
but the sale of power through that
machine through that EB charger will be
excise tax and sales tax as it should be
it's up to them to give it away if they
choose to
further further questions sure
um so so you're saying that someone will
have to pay for that electricity at that
quote unquote free pump yes ma'am I am
and and one more question
um are you
do you know for certain because I that
these these pumps that have been stopped
installed all over the state at you know
I don't know uh publics and other places
are they capable of monitoring uh you
know keeping up with that charge so that
they could these establishments could
continue to offer free charging yes
ma'am they have been I've been assured
that most of them the software will be a
software change for how it's built and
now some of them you know like you'll
see in one of the bill changes that were
made that Tesla uses an app now their
charger doesn't have a a screen to look
at it you look through your app each of
them has a little bit different method
of how they know who you are know for
you to pay it but most important for
Rick and all of us should be that we get
our excise tax to keep our roads and
bridges in good shape thank you Mr
chairman I think this is great Bill and
we're off to a great start with electric
vehicles just a little bit concerned
about those free Chargers thank you
thank you ma'am
gentlemen yield yes sir
representative drenner to your left
thank you Mr chairman there's a
gentleman yield yes ma'am
I agree with uh
that this is a great first start I'm I'm
just curious with these changes in the
bill
is this going to make Georgia about the
most expensive place in the nation to
own and operate uh EV vehicle
no ma'am it will not with a change
especially you know going from like say
9 to 11 it'll put us in the middle of
the pack
when when it was at nine we were
probably at the highest but with 11
we'll be in the middle
thank you Mr chairman yes ma'am
representing Martin to your right has a
question Mr chairman Mr chairman would
yield for a question oh absolutely isn't
it true that the way we treat
um electricity uh sale for resale and
someone having to pay tax on as you
mentioned it's just like you would for
that Coca-Cola you mentioned you either
pay sales tax or the the person that's
given away has to pay a use tax so we're
treating electricity the same way it
isn't that true yes sir you're right
thank you and the next question I wanted
to ask is about the the fee for the
registration uh can you you talk about
the need for this to go into place and
then that is isn't it true that in in
rules you mentioned that that fee would
be looked at over the over the years to
make sure it's being right size and is
appropriate you're talking about the fee
that the registration fee yes yes yeah
and we will I think the key thing that's
coming on that you'll see with GDOT is
now has a pilot program to look at
vehicle miles traveled which will
probably put a lot of light on that
where they that fee is at the right
place or it in
representative Tran to your left
has a question the gentleman's
recognized yes sir thank you Mr Speaker
will the chairman yield to a question
absolutely so I very much support this
bill and we'll be voting for it but I
have had a lot of constituents ask for
clarify clarification and that is for
lack of a better term dumb stations
charging stations that do not have
Network capability and app capability
are not able to meter their electrical
uses and there are essentially free
charging stations will we be in this
bill be mandating them to upgrade their
their charging stations oh absolutely we
will I think number one representative
we need to make sure that they're
accurate
that and that they're safe and I think
those are two important things and most
important to me I guess is the taxation
side of it but we've got to make sure
they're accurate and safe there is a
long lead time you look at the effective
dates of these bills
it's down the road so they're going to
have time to change and update
do you yield for one further question
sure yes sir do you know what that deal
time is is it one year five years the
lead time on this is 20 end of 25. I'm
not mistaken in that you know the neat
thing about this is like everything we
do in this building I'll have a list of
four things that I need to work on
during the interim to perfect what I
have here and uh and we'll be working on
that in the next year thank you thank
you
is that it Mr Speaker you've got a
couple you got a couple more if you want
to take them we want to make sure
everybody understands this
representative Kennard is recognized to
your left for our question thank you Mr
Speaker this is the gentleman yield
absolutely we currently assess a 26 Cent
per gallon fuel tax how does that what
is that calculus with a kilowatt per
hour cost and is it Equitable it is
Equitable that was a key thing that
Revenue worked on to make sure it was
Equitable and we through House Bill 170
give them the authority to do that and
if you read through the bill you'll see
these These are Equitable numbers to a
gallon of gasoline yeah one more
question sure so the
gasoline-powered car user and the
electric car user are basically paying
the same exact state tax fuel tax yes
okay the other thing about gasoline is
more on use the more you drive the more
you pay and for a fee base as chairman
Martin was talking about they're paying
213 or so for a year
no mileage included in that so it's a
little different how we do it so EB
users are not being penalized oh no in
no way they are no sir thank you
chairman Carpenter to your right in the
rear has a question does the gentleman
yield yes sir is it not true that this
this tax will will allow Georgians to
make sure that we're taxing individuals
that are driving through our state that
are currently paying tax on gas
hopefully that they when they stop to
charge that they'll be paying taxes for
our roads ABS absolutely Mr chairman
they'll also be buying coca-colas and
wieners and eating at restaurants as
they go through the state thank you
thank you for this bill
Mr chairman if there are no other
questions I yield well and ask for you
you have some questions but I'll be glad
to let you know let's keep let's keep on
going one couple more and then we'll
don't let your feet grow to the floor up
there now representative
um
Lisa Campbell is recognized for a
question to your left sure thank you Mr
Speaker does the gentleman yield yes
ma'am I have a question related to line
398 on page 17 which talks about no
person shall transport motor Fuel and it
looks like we've also added over public
highways or navigable Waters
of this state and I'm this may already
be prohibited but my question is that
does that also apply to rail transport
and if not why not if in here we're
talking about on public highways or
adaptive Waters except in a transport
truck or a vessel marked appropriately
so yes I'm a gasoline usually is not
transported by rails it's not no ma'am
thank you for the clarification that I
know of
Mr chairman

consideration on our bill and please

bill ever referred to the Committee on
Public Safety and Homeland Security that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
chairman Sainz is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker uh colleagues I
bring behind before you Senate Bill 159
is a simple bill that seeks to
um make it clear to individuals who we
appreciate working in our Correctional
Facilities uh to ensure that they're
safe and there's no bad actor there that
if you're a contractor or an employee of
the Georgia Department of Corrections
and you bring a legal Contraband to uh
give to an inmate that the penalty goes
from two to ten years and it does not
have the the the Restriction to probate
so there is no mandatory minimum in here
but it does raise the the um the
sentence to 10 years
Mr Speaker I will yield for a question
as if there is any
you have no questions but we do have a
speaker so you have no questions thank
you gentleman's yielded well
representative Kennard is recognized to
speak to the bill represent Kennard
thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise to
oppose SB 159
and at the risk of sounding preachy
I'm going to open my remarks with a
handful of scriptures
I'm very aware that the Bible can be
used to manipulate and it can even be
weaponized and that is not my intent
hopefully it's not my impact today
I am also extremely cognizant that the
scripture is very versatile and can be
skillfully used to say just about
anything you wanted to say and to
support or oppose virtually any issues
for instance during the Civil War
both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis
Davis both toured their parts of the
country using the Bible to build their
respective cases because there are
anti-slavery and pro-slavery passages in
the Bible you can find plenty of verses
to support either side it is a very
versatile 66 book
collection indeed
that said
I'm a pastor and I'm all in I have built
a career around the studying and
teaching of this Christian scripture
I'm over 35 years in now and that in no
way makes me an expert far from it as a
matter of fact the older I get the less
hubris I have
I tend to have a lot more questions than
answers
but where my greatest confidence lies is
in the four gospels the words that are
written in red and for many years now
the words of Jesus of Nazareth have been
almost my exclusive Focus for my
personal devotion
and my Teaching Ministry
and I would be disingenuous to say that
my faith does not impact my worldview
because it does
as a matter of fact I would be truthful
in saying that my spiritual journey
influences everything I do
including my decision to run for office
and to be in this room
The Words of Christ have been imprinted
on my subconscious since I was a small
child words like to whom much is given
much is required words like you are the
light of the world you are the salt of
the earth
and the implication is to for all of us
as enlightened Spiritual Beings to get
out and make an impact to come out of
our space spiritual zones our churches
our mosques our temples and to occupy
space right in the middle of society in
the world and to do what we can to make
a positive difference to make the world
a better place
now that I've pre-ambled for a minute
here I've set a stage to provide a
context because I believe the words
you're about to hear the ones written in
red are germane to the issue at hand at
least they are to me
in the Gospel of Luke it was Jesus's
first public conversation his first
public words
he was in the temple worshiping
at the place of his Youth and it was his
turn to provide the scripture of the day
and he grabbed the scroll from Isaiah
and read these words
the spirit of the Lord is on me because
he has anointed me to Proclaim good news
to the poor
he has sent me to Proclaim freedom for
the prisoners
and recovery of sight for the blind to
set the oppressed free to proclaim the
year of the Lord's favor this is Jesus's
first inaugural talk
he was establishing a mission and a
vision for Jesus Incorporated it was a
main part of his agenda
he was establishing what was important
what was priority and in that two
sentences he mentions interaction with
prisoners now this was an ongoing theme
for Christ
a passage that we're all familiar with
is from Matthew 25 as a matter of fact
the late speaker Roston used it last
year when he was presenting H.B 1013.
Matthew 25 reads like this then the king
will say to those on his right
come you who are blessed by my father
take your inheritance the kingdom
prepared for you since the creation of
the world for I was hungry
and you gave me something to eat I was
thirsty and you gave me something to
drink I was a stranger and you invited
me in I needed clothes and you clothed
me I was sick and you looked after me
and wait for it
I was in prison
and you came to visit me
then the righteous will answer him Lord
when did we see you hungry and feed you
when did we see you thirsty and gave you
something to drink when did we see you a
stranger invite you in or needing
clothes and clothe you when did we see
you in sick or in prison and go to visit
you and the King will reply truly I tell
you
whatever you did
for one of the least of these brothers
and sisters of mine
you did for me and then it goes on to
say and he will say to those on his left
depart from me you who are cursed into
the Eternal fire prepared for
I was hungry and you gave me nothing to
eat I was thirsty and you gave me
nothing to drink I was a stranger and
you did not invite me in I needed
clothes you did not clothe me I was sick
and in prison and you did not look after
me
they will also answer Lord when did we
see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger
and eating clothes or sick or in prison
and didn't I help you and he will reply
truly I tell you whatever you did not do
for one of the least of these you did
not do for me
what I'm doing is establishing what was
clearly the priorities for Jesus's
public Ministry and in that those two
scriptures he establishes that prisoners
and prisons were not a peripheral issue
it wasn't at the bottom of the list this
was at the top of the list like top five
now it's not lost on me that Jesus was
crucified between two thieves
to felons they all sat on death row
together awaiting their capital
punishment
so Christ was compelling us of not
commanding us to be involved on a
personal level with hunger
sickness
and the prison system to be consistently
involved this was not just a part of the
ministry this was the ministry and it
compels us to be involved too not just
making in end of your donation to the
cause not to just go to a soup line
during the holidays but these were that
Jesus things is Central focus and
Mission the main things he wanted his
followers to have a deep understanding
of these priority issues hunger poverty
health care and yes incarceration
he wanted us to have better
understanding the word understand
literally means to stand under
in other words when you have proximity
to an issue when you stand under it you
will have better and deeper
understanding of it because from a
distance issues look one way but when
you get up close and personal you have a
deeper more thoughtful mindful
understanding of it and when you start
having proximity to these issues like
hunger and homelessness and
incarceration and health care
when you engage on a consistent basis
you start asking questions questions
like why do we have hunger to begin with
questions like why do we have
disparities in health care to begin with
questions like why do we have this many
number of people incarcerated to begin
with
so I want us to take a minute
this morning to look under
our prison system and see firsthand
what's going on and who is behind bars
when you stand under our prison system
when you look at who is behind bars in
the state of Georgia you're going to see
some consistent groups number one
is you're going to see the mentally ill
you're going to see the mentally ill and
those who suffer
from substance use
we have made some great strides with HB
1013 the mental health parity act that
we passed last year and hopefully we'll
see the passage of HB 520 this year
we're making strides to turn this corner
but as it sits right now the largest
mental health service provider in our
state is Georgia State
prisons
so when you look under the system
it's going to be a glaring Stark
reminder that is the mentally ill and
those who suffer from substance use that
are being locked up in our prison system
secondly you're going to see the poor
incarcerated
most of the folks locked up in our state
prison system had a public defender
why because they did not have enough
financial resources to lawyer up and to
get really good representation
as a result they're getting what they
can take and there are a lot of good
public defenders out there and we
appreciate them I know a lot of them
but the the reality is is they're
overworked
their case loads are stretched then and
they cannot properly represent the folks
that they do and unfortunately the poor
get harsher sentences longer sentences
you're going to see the poor Behind Bars
when you look underneath our prison
system you're also going to see in
addition to the mentally ill and the
poor you're going to see minority groups
it's glaring
the truth is in this Century one in
three African-American males will have a
brush up with the justice system for
white males that is one in 17.
there are more African-American males
involved in our correction system in
America today then were enslaved in 1850
Georgia's African-American population is
30 percent
but in our prison system
African-Americans represent almost 60
percent you have to ask why
is it because African-Americans are more
inherently criminal no it's just there
is bias in our system that cannot be
denied
just a couple of weeks ago we passed
compensation resolutions for Mario
stinchcomb Michael Woolfolk devania
Inman and Terry Talley who we discovered
were wrongfully convicted
Mario and Michael spent 18 years each
devonia Inman spent 23 years
Terry Talley Smith 39 years wrongfully
convicted that's almost A Century Of
Time
of four
of those who were wrongfully commit
convicted were African-American males
when we look deeper into our prison
system we can't even ignore the economic
drivers some say that crime doesn't pay
I depend I say it depends on who you're
asking
if you're asking core Civic
that has private for-profit prisons in
Georgia they'll say the crime actually
does pay they're doing really well
they're traded on they're traded
publicly you can buy their stock on the
stock market today it's about nine bucks
a share
some say the crime doesn't pay I say it
depends on who you're asking why don't
we ask Southeast Corrections A
for-profit Private Probation company
that handles a significant amount of the
probationers in our state if you ask
them they'll say business is really good
especially in Georgia because we have
more people on probation than any other
state four times the national average
I think we have lost understanding of
our criminal and prison system and we
are legislating from a distance now and
we have lost touch
and that's why we have done such an
about face on Criminal Justice Reform
we've lost our way and that's why we're
seeing all these heavy hitting
sentencing measures we're not interested
in Justice we're not even interested in
punishment
these measures better reflect vengeance
when you look at SB 159 lines
61-63 it's a testament to how far off we
are
in line 61 through 63 of SB 159 it says
that if a prison employee hands someone
incarcerated a cigarette if they just
give them a cigarette
they will go to prison not for one two
three four five six seven eight nine
years but for 10 years for handing
someone a cigarette
or for a swig of alcohol
in what Universe does that even make
sense
that someone serves 10 years for a
cigarette
Abraham Maslow said if we only have if
the only tool we have is a hammer
then you see every problem as a nail
Governor deal tried to expand our
toolbox and give us more options but to
use an old term from my Bible Belt
Pentecostal days we have backslid It's
hammer time in Georgia and we are Too
Legit to Quit
our Compass needs to be recalibrated we
really need to check our hearts and
think about what we're doing because I
remind you Jesus said how you treat the
incarcerated is a reflection on how you
feel about him
whatever you've done for the least of
these you've done it unto me
so my thoughts are my thoughts are we
should examine our hearts and figure out
a more respectful honorable humane way
to incarcerate
I think we should double down on our
efforts to decriminalize mental health
to decriminalize Poverty to
decriminalize race and get our
incarceration rates down let's get our
prison facilities up to a habitable
standard many of them which are not
I visit our state prisons I've on a tour
now to visit all of them all 34. I've
got about halfway done uh covet kind of
stopped me in my tracks but I'm getting
back on that circuit but our our prisons
need a lot of help
they're in poor conditions
we also need to be more transparent
about those conditions
our doc employees
should start being compensated for what
they deserve to get out of financial
desperation we're we're paying them so
little they have to be in financial
desperation that makes them susceptible
to this bartering that may be going on
SB 159
does nothing to help our Workforce
challenges in the doc and it probably
makes them worse
now please understand me
people who break the law should pay
consequences
but our state motto is Justice
moderation and wisdom
in our prison policies are none of those
three they're not just they're not
moderate and they're just not smart
when Georgia was established as a as a
colony by James Oglethorpe we were
established as a penal colony
prisoners from England would come to the
Georgia colony to work off their senates
some may argue that we still are
that we're living up to that Legacy
chief justice Boggs told us just a week
ago
that in the U.S 1 in 33 are under
Congressional control
in Georgia that number is 1 in 13.
listen we have 10.7 million people
in this state and we have
4.523 criminal records individual
criminal records almost 40 percent
ladies and gentlemen of this chamber I'm
very sincere in saying this but I think
we can do better
and I look forward to working towards a
better Georgia with better Criminal
Justice policies better prison policies
and for this reasons that I just
outlined I am voting though to SB 159
and I encourage you to do so
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
gentleman has yielded the well
is there an objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair he has
done the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting The
committee's Substitute chair has done
the committee's substitute is adopted is
there an objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair he has done the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machine
here we go
for what purpose does chairman Knight
Rise parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true that if
you read this bill all this bill is
doing is saying that an employer or
contractor
of the Department of Corrections who
already breaks the law aren't we just
upping the penalty for bringing
Contraband into our correction systems
in Georgia which is a problem with drugs
guns and telephone Telecommunications
isn't that what this bill does
I've always known the gentleman to be a
diligent reader of legislation I'm sure
he believes what he so speaks
for what purpose does chairman Newton
rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry Mr
Speaker isn't it true that the out one
of the outcomes of passing SB 159 would
be to decrease smuggled weapons weapons
that are smuggled to criminal prisoners
and this decrease will help protect
those who are incarcerated trying to
serve their sentence and get some
training and get out and be part of
society
if the gentleman is those States for
what purpose is Chairman Sainz rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry is
it not true that both the defenses
attorneys Association and the
prosecutors Association both didn't have
objection to this bill during committee
and those slightly beyond the scope of
this bill I started having questions
about judicial discretion when Pontius
Pilate sentences Christ to crucifixion
I'm sure the gentleman knows what he
States
for what purposes representing Maynor
rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the
state tree inquiry is it not true that I
do agree that we should not let law
enforcement
provide Contraband to
um those that are jailed but recently on
the news there was a Jailer that
was doing inappropriate behavior with an
inmate which involved
Contraband
um and although she should not have done
that I know she does not want to be in
prison for 10 years for doing that
inappropriate behavior that was on the
news
is that not true
I'm sure if it was on the news it must
be true
the
if the ladies those States
for what purposes represent events
rise
parliamentary inquiries sir inquiry
is it not true that this bill is not
about the treatment of inmates who were
convicted and incarcerated because of
their crimes
but about the employees and vendors who
knowingly flaunt the laws they know
better than break for the almighty
dollar and that we are a state that
should conform to laws
if the gentleman sow States I'm sure he
believes that for what purposes chairman
Collins rise parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry Mr Speaker is it not true that
these criminal street gangs are
providing these cell phones to inmates
and as as such these inmates are using
their influence outside of the prison
system to wreak havoc and cause public
safety issues for all of Georgia
regardless of where your ZIP code is or
where you live is that not true Mr
Speaker
States yes sir
I'll tell you we're going to tell I'm
going to take two more we've debated
this issue pretty well
for what purposes representative Vermont
rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker is it not true that
one of the biggest problems in our
prison system is that people continue to
return to that prison system and
particularly there's a correlation with
how long they are in that prison system
and how often they come back based on
that length so as we continue to pursue
these laws we need to be aware of what
we are doing to those individuals
I'm sure the lady believes what she says
States for what purpose is whip
Burchette rise parliamentary inquiry
State your inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
is it not true that uh evidence by
Alliance 55 4 through 56 that the
language reads here term of imprisonment
of 10 years and because we struck that
language
the judge can read it to say we can
probate
nine years and serve one isn't that true
Mr Mr Speaker if the gentleman's those
States
the judge has that discretion
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine on the passage of
the bill the yeas were 103 the Nays 72
the bill haven't received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
Mr Clerk
if you'll read the caption to Senate
Bill 168 168.
Senate Bill 168 by Senator Williams the
25th to be entitled knack to amend part
8 of article a to chapter 14 and title
44 of the fish go to George annotated
relating the liens of hospitals and
nursing homes so as to allow a
chiropractic practice to have a lien on
a cause of action
Miss Bill Adam referred to the committee
on Judiciary that committee recommends
that this bill do pass
representative leopard is recognized to
present the bill
ladies and gentlemen of the house I'm
presenting you Senate Bill 168 another
bill initiated by our former colleague
Senator Rick Williams
I know representative Thomas always
enjoys a good Yogi Bear quote and I
think this is deja vu all over again
would be appropriate for this this bill
because I believe this has been tried
before and we're hoping this year it
finally makes it it amends our an
existing statute referred to often as
the hospital lien statute it's a statute
which allows hospitals and Physicians
and nursing homes and and burn Trauma
Centers a lien against a cause of action
not against the individual not against
the individual patients property but
against the cause of action so that they
can increase the chances they'll get
paid basically what that means is if
there's a settlement based on a claim
that the patient had against a third
party like in a car accident or
something of that nature the the lien
helps the the health care provider get
paid from the proceeds of any settlement
or verdict
um so we currently allow this procedure
for hospitals nursing homes I think I
mentioned the the entities that are
entitled to use it we're basically
adding Chiropractic practices to the the
entities who would be entitled to the
lien and that's important because
frequently at least in the in the motor
vehicle accident context chiropractors
are often the ones who provide a service
um and the patient at that time does not
have money to pay the bill and this
helps ensure that when the patient gets
a judgment or gets a settlement that at
that point the chiropractor can get paid
um so the um the the other provision
there was a change made on the floor of
the Senate which allow which basically
says if the chiropractor is treating
someone who was a patient that was
insured in a plan that they participate
in they have to make a claim on the
insurance first and if they get paid
according to the terms of the insurance
plan they can file the lien as a
protective measure but at the end of the
day they cannot enforce that lien if
they've been paid by the insurance
company so we believe this is a much
needed uh protection for chiropractors
it puts them in the same classification
as doctors and hospitals under the
statute and will help make sure that
they get paid for the services they
provide to Georgians and it also has
that consumer protection that requires
that both the chiropractors and
hospitals and the other Health Care
Professionals entitled to the
protections of the bill
do have to make that claim on insurance
first and can't enforce the lien unless
they uh have the claim has been denied
in some fashion so that's that's the
gist of the bill Mr Speaker I'll stand
for any questions you have a couple of
the gentleman yields I yield
minor minority leader of this house
leader Beverly has a question is
recognized thank you Mr Speaker I want
to draw your attention lines 84 through
88 isn't it true
that
through lines 84 88 will simply required
that providers filed with insurers to
get a claim rejected before enforcing
any lien that's exactly correct and one
further question is it further true that
providers have negotiated with the
insurers for rates already and indeed
they have as we like to say in this
building Mr leader of the gentleman
knows of what he speaks thank you very
much good Bill thank you for the
question gentlemen has another question
representative Frye to your left has a
question
thank you Mr speakers gentleman yield I
yield
um so is this still going to allow the
when you say a lien is this going to go
on the individual's credit if the
insurer denies the claim
or is it just a lien to file against the
claim for the insurance payment well
it's it's considered legally to be a
lien against the cause of action so it
doesn't necessarily apply to the
insurance payment but if the insurance
company pays and settlement of the claim
then it would attach to that so it
doesn't attach the property it doesn't
attach to any land that the patient owes
and it doesn't follow the patient it's
just again against any money that's paid
on the settlement I can't speak as to
whether it shows up on credit
um I I do know it's it's the liens are
filed in the clerk's office and I
suppose those could be reported by
Credit Agencies but again the the goal
here is to make sure that
the chiropractor in this case gets paid
from that those settlement proceeds okay
thank you for your answer thank you for
the question
gentlemen yield for another question yes
Mr Speaker I'll yield
chairman Knight to your right is
recognized for a question this is
gentleman yield I yield yes sir
to my friend in the well friendly
question isn't this just the bill that
sort of cracking open the code allowing
for adjustments
so that our chiropractors can be treated
I don't know fairly and equally
as the other providers are that's
exactly correct thank you sir
and artfully asked I might add
some further questions I'm sorry well
thank you no further questions no
further questions all you the well and
ask everyone's favorable consideration
of Senate Bill 168. thank you
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair has
done the previous question is ordered is

chair lady Dempsey is recognized to

[Music]
thank you Mr Speaker
good afternoon I'm bringing to you a
very serious measure No Doubt
it's not very complicated what we're
proposing to do today
but I know there's a lot of passion and
a lot of heart and a lot of different
feelings in this room and throughout our
state about it the intent of this bill
hsb62
it is a modest reform that merely
ensures no city in Georgia goes down the
dangerous path that cities such as Los
Angeles and Austin Texas have gone down
where they have encouraged Street
sleeping and camping
we know that street camps most
importantly
are dangerous for homeless people
themselves
when I leave this Capital every day and
I drive toward a place over near
Centennial Park where I stay
I usually pass at least 25 people
that are setting up and the later in the
day it is the more people that are there
some are intense
some simply have cardboard
some just have blankets
they're in nooks and crannies
from the U.S Postal Service door to
restaurants to businesses that are
trying to thrive down Marietta Street
when I come here
from Rome and I get off of the
interstate I can always count on someone
coming up to my car and asking me for
money
they're not always very nice about it
either I've had my car scratched I've
had them Jump On It
I don't have a legislative tag on my car
anymore because it's not really safe as
a female to sometimes let people know
exactly who you are
Street camps are dangerous for the
people
the cities that have allowed it have
seen increases in the number of homeless
deaths and violence against those people
who are searching for a better safer
place to be every single night
when the city of Atlanta has almost 50
percent of its shelter beds unused
large amounts of other unused beds
across our state we should not have
cities who are looking away
as people choose or feel they must find
different places to put their head every
night they're not all adults some are
children and that's truly tragic
this bill requires a performance audit
of state and local government homeless
spending
that audit will be done to make sure
that we know that that as I said State
local and federal dollars that are
passing through Georgia's hands
are going exactly where we think they
should be and are maximizing the
benefits of that chairman Houston and I
both through Economic Development and
through the human resources budget both
have buckets of this money
and it is hard to deal with the
painfulness
that we know those people
are not getting all of the services all
of the housing all of the needs that
they need but we do not know exactly who
they are or how much it is so this audit
will help with that
it will be done by December 31st with a
report to the governor lieutenant
governor and the speaker
the audit will be done by the Georgia
Department of audits and accounts they
do performance audits on so many things
throughout our state from tax incentive
programs and and scholarship programs I
think that they can do the very best job
on making sure that we do this it's not
duplicative it will be true to the
resources that we have as a state to
better provide the services that are
needed to help people not have to search
every night for a place to live
other state and local governments such
as Washington have done this and have
found great success with knowing exactly
where they can best effectively spend
the bill also prevents hospitals and
local governments from taking homeless
people and dropping them off in other
communities
where they don't have any place to go or
any means of support
everyone everyone should be concerned
about anyone that we pass
that is without a home there is no doubt
the goal is to find primitive permanent
Supportive Housing for each and every
individual who's struggling with mental
health
homelessness loss of income
but in the meantime we need to know the
who the what and the why to plan
accordingly
Mr Speaker
I will take questions if there are some
the lady the lady year she has a couple
of questions several of them yes as a
matter of fact
represent Al is represent is recognized
for a question to your right
thank you does the lady yield I do
my questions have to do with section two
of the bill if you look to lines 44
through 46 I'm just going to go through
this slowly because when I was reading
it there's a lot of like double and
triple negatives that kind of Stack Up
on each other but lines 44-46 prohibit
counties or municipalities from being
able to decide not to enforce ordinances
to prosecute the in-house for sleeping
Outdoors
how does this not
preempt local control
this simply says that if you have an
ordinance if you have decided to have an
ordinance or a policy
that you cannot just decide to make any
public or any person's property your
living environment
if that policy is there in that
governing
municipality or County they cannot
ignore it it must be upheld it's also
not telling anyone that they have to
have them but if they do like any other
law in our state it needs to be enforced
so just to follow up on those ordinances
needing to be enforced if the lady will
further yield for one more question
certainly so related to what you just
said if officers of the peace and
Prosecuting attorneys are now required
to obey these ordinances and to
prosecute these
relatively low level offenses how does
this not end up diverting Time Manpower
and resources from prosecuting
violent crime which I know we all care
very much about
some of these can lead to violent crimes
as I said there have been a lot of
deaths in homeless random encampments
not supervised across our nation tell me
exactly which lines you were referring
to now please represent it was the same
44-46 my point was just being that if
they are required to enforce these
ordinances does this not drain resources
from
Prosecuting violent crime that's already
taken place not prospective or projected
I think we have to understand that we're
looking at someone who's in a tragic
situation when we see someone sleeping
right now law enforcement in many
communities across our state are
stopping and trying to lend a hand
trying to help find them a place the
idea is not to criminalize it it is to
make sure that those communities who are
ignoring it actually do pick up local
control and do decide what is best for
their community and the number that are
seeking help or need help once we have
this audit will be much more manageable
for them to do it is not to take someone
directly to jail this is to help not
only make our community safer but to
extend the the love and charitable
Hospitality I think hospitable work to
make sure that someone has a better
place than a sidewalk
so you're saying that Prosecuting
sleeping Outdoors is helping
homeless people no I'm saying exactly
the opposite exactly the opposite
the bill says the opposite
lady here for another question yes we're
going to say Butler to your left is
recognized for a question
thank you does the lady yelled I do
um
about three years ago it was the win
winner before covid uh representative
Roger Bruce and I went to meet with the
governor about several encampments that
are on our way to the Capitol and we're
concerned about the people that were
there we were told then that there was a
count done once a year of the homeless
people
here in the metro area
and I was wondering I understand this is
an audit of funds that are available do
you have anything well is there anything
put back in place to continue that count
because during covid they stopped doing
the actual count of the number of people
and and I was just wondering if this
replaces that if this is just different
is that count going to continue because
it seems we would need to have some
sense of who is out there so we'd know
about the resources that we want to
allocate absolutely and that's part of
this the count is a federal measure it
happens actually throughout our whole
state on that one night though so you
get that one snapshot of one night what
is going on and as the night begins
sometimes people are not as available to
be counted sometimes people are there
because they want to be counted we're
trying to get more of a handle around
how much it is it hurts me to not give
as much money as probably we should
it should be a higher priority I think
this matters that's what the audit is
about I think this matters in the same
way that many of those tax cuts and many
of the other measures that are audited
do measure so this will be to make sure
that we know how many who what where
each Community will have the ability to
do more but not to allow Street camping
if they have that policy if they decide
if they've decided hey we like it
everybody come here and stay sleep on
our sidewalks block the streets make it
hard for people to get get around let's
stop Economic Development here let's not
have tourism come to Atlanta if anyone
wants to decide that and if any of us
feel good driving past this like it
doesn't sound like you did then we are
on the path right now for that
thank you
less
representative Oliver to your left has a
question that ladies recognize for a
question this lady you I certainly do
I have seven police districts in my
district
three cities an unincorporated DeKalb
Marta and I also have two universities
police districts I have a hospital and
unincorporated DeKalb I have a hospital
in city of Atlanta and I have a hospital
with City Decatur explain to me how The
Dumping provision works for me in my
district who can take whom where
when you've had Hospital services or
need Hospital Services they need to be
where you are from or where you are
found you understand my question I do
understand that in Atlanta it's a little
complicated I do get that and there will
probably have to be some ways to work
that out but I think that in each and
every one of those areas that you've
said there are resources the main thing
we want to do is not let someone
and you'll probably hear more about this
from some of the other speakers some of
the stories that are actually really
happening where someone just knows that
there is a little better opportunity not
so much in the metro area as much as in
our rural areas to take them out of
County and then they are no longer seem
to be a burden for that Community final
question ma'am yes we had no testimony
about these alleged stories that are
happening and I believe they could be
happening but as a practical matter the
word is not complicated the word is
totally unworkable thank you
Mr Speaker I will yield the well as you
said there are several other speakers
and then um come back if if needed later
but I do want to ask y'all to think this
is a heartfelt measure it goes beyond
the ease
of just saying there's a homeless person
there's a tent they're okay tonight it's
cold it's 10 degrees in Atlanta it's
okay
it's a hundred degrees in Atlanta
they're okay I think there's compassion
in all of us to find this is not making
it impossible it's making it possible to
make sure that we spend our resources
and develop the appropriate programs for
those who are in the greatest of need
thank you Mr Speaker I yield The Well
the lady has yielded the well we have a
number of speakers some want to
recognize to speak to the bill
representative Mari Crawford is
recognized to speak to the bill resident
Crawford
this is excuse me a gentleman was to
spend just for a second we have a number
of folks opposed and those in favor each
side will be allocated 30 minutes to
speak I apologize to you for not getting
that clear first the gentleman's
recognized
thank you Mr Speaker
distinguished body good afternoon today
I Rise to oppose Senate Bill 62 because
of the negative impact that it will have
on our less fortunate
indeed this is a heartfelt manner
but I'll start to say that no one
chooses to be poor and it was said in
this well
that this bill will help us to learn the
who's the wise and the whats and I don't
doubt that this bill could potentially
do that but what I would say is let's
figure that out before we pass
Senate bill 62.
you see poverty is no accident it's
man-made and can be removed by human
actions our actions and we can end or at
the very least significantly reduce
poverty should we choose to but instead
of assisting those in need we are about
to pass a bill that will cause more harm
to our most vulnerable citizens
today my main focus will be to
concentrate on section two
it was previously asked about lines 44
through 46.
they read important in part that a
county over a municipal Corporation
should not adopt or enforce any written
policy which prohibits the enforcement
of any order or ordinance prohibiting
unauthorized public Camping sleeping or
obstruction of sidewalks now that's a
mouthful but what this plainly means is
this bill sets up a path to punish local
governments that don't enforce penalties
against temporary habitation better
known as homelessness
currently our local governments who by
the way have a better understanding of
their homeless populations
have created ordinances that prohibit
the homeless population from
criminalization
this bill if passed would challenge
those efforts potentially placing the
poor in our Criminal Justice System thus
exacerbating the many factors that lead
to Poverty to begin with
but micromanaging local governments and
jurisdictions will not address the root
cause of homelessness
how blessed are we we get an opportunity
to call this beautiful place our home
our second home
and while the work is tiring it's
rewarding
we get an opportunity to serve as we
should be
and yes we're talented and yes we're
here because we work hard but the
reality is we are all occupying these
seats because of Fortune
but the minute that we walk out of this
door as you just heard there are people
who are less fortunate than we are and
it's our jobs as public servants to help
those who are less fortunate
now we just had an incredible storm
yesterday
there were people who had to sleep on
the streets because they had no places
to go no one wants to sleep on the
streets think about that no one wants to
be homeless but we're obligated to help
those who are and oddly
in a room of public servants I feel the
need to emphasize
that our government our state government
is funded
upon the will of the people and it's
instituted solely for the good of the
whole I place a special emphasis on the
term whole
now if this sounds familiar to you then
good because it comes straight from our
state constitution
you see we have a duty to serve the
whole population especially those with
little to no resources and Senate Bill
62 is not good for the whole population
of Georgia
now there are many ways that we can help
we have the resources to help for
residents we can increase State funding
on housing options for the homeless
additionally we could address the
affordable housing crisis we could raise
minimum wage we can expand Medicaid we
can increase funding for mental health
and increase funding for the Department
of Community Affairs State Housing Trust
Fund for the homeless we could do all of
those things before we passed Senate
Bill 62 but we're choosing not to do
that and therefore we are potentially
criminalizing those who are homeless and
if we should pass this bill before we
actually try to understand and seriously
as a body shame on us
but you can't serve the people that you
can't see
so I ask you do we actually try to see
the homeless population and
understanding until they become a
nuisance To Us by panhandling
now I don't doubt that anybody in here
loves panhandling I understand that too
many of you it is a nuisance however
that's the best that some people can do
and we have to understand that and while
homelessness
it's an issue throughout the state of
Georgia it's most prevalent in metro
Atlanta in fact Federal data shows that
of the approximate 10 000 homeless
people in Georgia nearly 70 percent of
them live in metro Atlanta so what
should be noted that a lot of people in
this room amongst our distinguished body
who are about to vote on this bill don't
have large homeless populations in their
districts in fact the only interaction
that you have with homeless populations
is when you come to the state capitol
but even if you don't have large
homeless populations in your District we
should seek to better understand poverty
now as you just heard proponents of this
bill say that we should have a homeless
population going to shelters well I
don't deny that but that argument
doesn't account for the challenges that
some of our homeless population face
when trying to enter homeless shelters
these challenges include but are not
limited to the lack of space at shelters
and we also have to note that a lot of
our homeless shelters are not equipped
to accommodate the mentally ill or the
physically disabled which means that
there will be homeless people who cannot
get into shelters
Additionally the homeless population
faces a myriad of problems to include
but not limited to
abuse
symptoms of trauma and some have medical
conditions that said many of our
homeless populations will need help
Beyond shelters
and again we as a body could help and we
should
now
I want to share something with you that
I learned
unsurprisingly and I didn't know this
the temporary habitation which includes
the erection of tents or shelters the
laying down of sleeping bags blankets or
other materials used for bedding on
highways is already illegal under
ocg832-66 yes it is already a crime to
sleep on the side of the road
however a lot of our local governments
have done all that they could can do to
help their homeless population because
they understand that population better
than we do in the state
I also asked a few solicitor generals
who have the largest homeless
populations in their districts if
they've ever prosecuted anyone under
this current statue and as you can
expect the informing that they don't
they work with local officials to help
and instead the prosecutors and
solicitor generals they find it in their
best interest to actually prosecute
crimes
that we want protection from you know
the ones that some of us talked about in
this world throughout the legislative
session
under Senate Bill 62 local jurisdiction
must enforce laws prohibiting
unauthorized Camping sleeping or
obstruction of sidewalks and
unfortunately this enforcement will
increase the population in our County
jails making our County spend more money
criminal penalties for sitting sleeping
or laying down on the public property
for homeless individuals who can't
obtain shelter will also be a violation
of the eighth amendment's cruel and
unusual punishment
we shouldn't subject our vulnerable crit
citizens to this type of criminal
prosecution now again coincidentally a
lot of colleagues have discussed what we
need to do with some of our most violent
criminals are we about to subject our
homeless population to that type of
punishment we shouldn't
but I regret to inform some of our
solicitor generals who've never used the
temporary habitation statute that
they're going to have to now because if
you recall we just took away the
discretion of our solicitor generals and
prosecutors when we pass HB 231
but now my question is what problem does
this legislation actually solve
is it going to protect us from the
homeless population
is it going to help the homeless
population to begin with
because the last time that I checked as
we are talking about criminals the most
dangerous criminals the ones that
actually cause the most harm are the
ones that actually are the most
privileged those are the ones that
actually have homes to go to
but further passing this bill will you
bet it it will increase the racial
disparities because as you can imagine
the majority of the homeless population
in our state statistics show are yep
black people
no surprise here that black people in
Georgia experience homelessness more
than any other group so if Senate Bill
62 passed this bill could potentially
have the same impact of the post-bellum
system criminal justice system that
locked black people up simply because
they had no place to go and I hope that
we as a body don't vote for this
building go back to those days
There's No One path to homelessness
and we must stop thinking that poverty
is a moral failing or a choice rooted in
laziness a lack of talent or lack of
intelligence we must end policies and
practices that criminalize poverty
instead we must have bipartisan support
to help those who need it the most we
can't punish people because we as a
legislator has not historically provided
people with the necessarily resources to
enjoy what we deem to be the American
dream
criminal codes are already full of
offenses that punish people for being
poor we need to repeal them all
but we can make progress by opposing
Senate bill 62.
because again it will negatively impact
our most vulnerable population allow our
local governments to address their
homeless population with the knowledge
and the resources that they have
if people are sleeping on the streets I
ask you to help them to help them to get
off the streets to help them to find
housing but at the very least if you
want help
then move over and allow someone else to
I ask you to oppose Senate Bill 62
because again it is going to negatively
impact our most vulnerable citizens
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
the gentleman has yielded well
representative Holland is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I rise today to speak again Senate bill
62.
because like many of you I started
getting a flood of emails in my email
box
from advocacy organizations that serve
the homeless that said please vote no on
this bill
and I'm an expert on a lot of things
most of which never come in handy in
this chamber but something I'm not an
expert on is homelessness
and so I thought perhaps it was time to
listen to the people who understood how
homelessness is impacting our
communities and what we can do to help
it rather than have the arrogance to
think that I knew what was best for my
community
but you know what there's a group of
people who have done study on this in
this building there is a senate
committee on unsheltered homelessness
that released their final report this
year
they made 26 recommendations for what we
could do to relieve homelessness in our
communities
for example
pair housing funding with support
services including mental and physical
health care
this bill does not do that
provide free state IDs for people with a
homelessness verification letter we
talked about this in a previous Bill
allowing people who were leaving prison
to have state IDs because it without a
state ID you can't do anything you can't
secure housing you can't get a job you
can't get a cell phone
provide free state IDs for people who
are homeless
this bill doesn't do that
increase the minimum wage to eradicate
poverty
this bill does not do that
connect veterans facing unsheltered or
sheltered homelessness with assistance
at the state and federal level
in other words
find the people who have served our
country in the military and connect them
with the resources they need
to allow them to be housed this bill
does not do that
or the last recommendation I'll mention
oppose the criminalization of
homelessness
this bill does not do that
there was a photojournalist who produced
a picture that has stuck with me for a
really long time it is a picture of a
homeless man and when I say a homeless
man it is exactly the picture that just
popped into your head when I said those
two words together it was a man
with a beard and graying hair looking
unkempt
in clothes that looked very worn and a
little dirty
and he's holding a cardboard sign and we
all know what we expect to see on this
cardboard sign can you help
please spare a dime
hungry
that's not what this man's cardboard
sign said
his cardboard sign said
I used to be a person
I used to be a person
there was a learning session at my
church where we invited in homelessness
organizations to help us become better
educated and that brought up the same
idea that for many people who are
experiencing homelessness the most
difficult thing is the invisibility
how we walk down the street and we
simply look through them
look past them as if they are no longer
human beings
I used to be a person
that homeless person could have been
perhaps the image that didn't pop into
your head it could have been a mother
fleeing an abusive spouse with her
children
it could have been a teenager who got
kicked out of his home because he came
out as gay to his parents
it could be a person struggling with
addiction wanting desperately in his
heart to find a better path but having
no luck finding a bed
where he could receive services
it could be a vet
with PTSD struggling to connect
with those Mental Health Services that
could help him get better
I get asked by constituents a lot about
what the state is doing to address
homelessness I live in one of those
districts that is experiencing this as a
real challenge we see a growing number
of families panhandling and shopping
centers people sleeping in store
doorways or under Highway underpasses
my constituents asked me what are we
doing to help these people
what are we doing to lift up these
children of God who are suffering how
can we help
now I have to tell my constituents not
only are we not helping the unhoused
we're not even seeing them anymore as
people
we're just seeing them as criminals
shame on us Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
representative Jasmine Clark is
recognized to speak to the bill
representative Clark
thank you Mr Speaker
today I Rise to ask you to vote no on SB
62
and today I want to further what my
colleague was talking about
when a person or a family finds
themselves in a position where they are
unhoused
incarceration
and criminalization are rarely if ever a
viable solution
falling on Hard Times is hard enough
I know several of you have gotten emails
from members of community especially
during the pandemic that they were
facing eviction
they were pleading for any type of help
that would keep a roof over their head
or over their family's head
the truth is when an individual finds
themselves facing homelessness it can
feel like the world is kicking them
while they're down
I'm sure every person in here is
privileged enough that you've never had
to experience this but have you ever
tried to navigate finding housing after
you've been evicted
it's very hard
for those who will allow individuals
with a previous eviction with a second
chance it usually requires a lot of
resources
huge deposits multiple months of rent up
front
if a person is already struggling these
requirements can feel insurmountable
so let's say they can't find that
permanent housing they can't find an
apartment that they can get those
deposits and those months of rent up
front
sometimes then a person might say well I
have to go somewhere let me find a hotel
room
it's not perfect but it's better than
sleeping on the street
the problem is hotels are expensive
it can cost 99 to almost 200 dollars per
week to stay in an extended stay
and I know it may be hard for some of
you all to Fathom this but not everyone
has that kind of money in their pocket
every single week
and even if they do have that type of
money
if they're using that money to pay for a
hotel then how are they saving so they
can afford that huge deposit that they
need so they can get into something more
permanent
it's very difficult to save money when
you're spending pretty much all that you
have just to keep a roof over your head
so you and your children don't have to
sleep on the street
but let's say a person can't afford a
hotel or they can't find a hotel or
they're put out of a hotel that they're
in and they can't find another one
they may seek out a homeless shelter
but the problem with this is that every
shelter doesn't have room for those
seeking help and some of these shelters
are very stringent on who can come to
that show shelter and they don't allow
access to every single person needing
help
and I know this might come as a surprise
because it came as a surprise to me but
some shelters actually charge a fee in
order for you to get into the homeless
shelter it's not free
and that's because they need money in
order to operate and they're not getting
it from other places and so even though
this fee is probably pretty small to
some of us
for some other people this is cost
prohibitive and they are not able to go
into that shelter
so now what's left
I can't find permanent housing because I
can't afford these huge deposits
I can't afford to stay in a hotel for
weeks and weeks at a time
I can't get into a homeless shelter
because of the requirements for that
shelter or because I can't afford it I
can't even afford to get into a shelter
maybe I have a car that's what I'll do
I'll sleep in my car and a parking lot
somewhere
if my car hasn't already been
repossessed because I'm really on hard
times right now
and even if I have that car there's no
guarantee that I will not come I will
not interact with law enforcement
because I parked in the wrong place
so now where do I go
if a person finds themselves having to
sleep on the street it's not because
that's where they want to sleep there
are very few people out here that chose
either I'm going to stay in an apartment
or I'm going to sleep on the street
there's a whole lot that happened in
between then
these are people having hard times they
are not criminals it is not against the
law to be poor it is not against the law
to lose your job it is not against the
law for your job to not pay you maybe it
should be not pay you because your baby
was sick and you needed to take off work
and when you take off work you don't get
paid and when you don't get paid you
can't make rent that is not against the
law
so when a local government decides that
they do not want to utilize their money
time and resources to go after homeless
people
we should allow them to do what they
feel is best for their community
Once Upon a Time people in this chamber
took pride in home rule and local
control
I'm not sure where those days have gone
but bills like this fly in the face that
our local and duly elected governing
bodies do not need the state
level preempting their authority to
govern their communities accordingly
instead bills like this ones that
criminalize homelessness instead of
bills like this that criminalize
homelessness we need bills that address
the root cause of homelessness
there are people in this state and I
want y'all to hear this because I think
a lot of times when we think of homeless
people as my colleague said when she was
in the well you have a picture in your
mind of who these homeless people are
but let me let me set the record
straight there are people in this state
that are working multiple jobs
and even with that income they are
barely making ends meet
they find themselves a sick child away
from not being able to make rent because
if they miss work they don't get paid
there are people on the streets that are
suffering from mental health issues and
usually the only option for them is in
our jails that is literally where
they're getting their care
there are people in this state that work
every single day and then have to go
sleep in a tent because they do not have
another option
so where are the bills that increase
wages
where are the bills that would guarantee
paid leave so that if you have to take
care of your sick baby you do not a lose
your job or be you have the means to
still pay your bills at the same time
where are those bills
where are the bills that ensure that
people have access to Affordable Health
Care so they don't find themselves
homeless because of crippling medical
debt
do you know there are people that might
find themselves not being able to make
rent or find themselves out of a home
because they got a devastating medical
diagnosis that is very very expensive
and they have to choose will I live or
will I will I find the money to pay
these medical bills or and live or will
I die
why would we be forcing law enforcement
and prosecutors to lock up these people
instead of finding ways to just keep
these people off the street in the first
place
I'm asking you all to look into your
hearts and realize that homeless people
are people
I'll say that again because it's kind of
loud and I want to make sure that
everybody in the chamber heard what I
said homeless people are people
they are human beings they are not trash
They Are Not Invisible
they are someone's mom
someone's daughter
someone's Uncle someone that someone
cared about
they are veterans they are people
suffering with mental health issues they
are people that are working in a job
somewhere
they are not just numbers and they are
not just dollars they are people
when you vote today I hope that you will
consider their humanity and vote no on
this Bill thank you Mr Speaker I yo the
well
the lady has yielded the well that
completes all of those that were opposed
to SB 62 now we'll hear from those for
up to
up to 30 minutes that are in favor
representing Rick Townsend is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I'm just going to speak for just a
couple of minutes uh it's not I'm not
going to be long-winded or anything else
I just want to talk a little about how
effects Home Brunswick Georgia Glenn
County Georgia
one of the things I like about this bill
based on
my community where I live it prohibits
hospitals local governments local
authorities from dropping off the
homeless other than that the county of
residents reason I say that our local
officials our private Community are
really non-profits have joined together
to help out the homeless in the area we
have numerous Services down there
including the well
it's a day shelter for homeless we have
the course of Salvation Army we have a
Mana house we serve meals every day
which I volunteered in before and
visited the well quite a bit and had
contributed to help out as well
we're working together for this issue to
help our community out we're having
trouble
in Brunswick Georgia
from others bringing people in and
dropping them off because they heard we
have great Services we've been started a
village for homeless veterans down there
and so all I'm asking is
we're helping ourselves we're trying to
help our community we're trying to take
care of the homeless down there
they're our brothers and sisters
they are people I totally amen all that
I totally agree
so let us help us let's we need to help
ourselves help our people help our
population all we can and we'll do that
and thank you and I yield the well
gentlemen has yielded the well
representative Gaines is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank thank you Mr Speaker and uh first
want to say thank you to chair Dempsey
for her great work on this measure I
think this is one of the most important
bills that we'll see this session it's
an issue that faces communities across
our state and certainly in my district
in Athens it's something that we've seen
significant challenges with and and
believe this bill is a big step forward
in addressing that challenge there have
been a lot of conversations from the
well so far and a lot of the things that
we've heard over the last several
minutes relate to this issue but but are
totally unrelated to this bill and so I
think it's important that as we continue
this discussion and we wind down towards
voting on Senate Bill 62 that we
consider what's actually in this bill
and what this bill will do it's a very
simple measure
and the fir there's really three
objectives of it one is just saying that
if you're a local governments need to
enforce the laws that they have on the
books it's that simple is if you have a
if you have an ordinance or local uh
local local ordinances that are on your
books you have to enforce the laws that
you pass
secondly it's an audit of spending
that's that that we're spending at local
state and federal dollars on how we're
spending related to homelessness and
making sure that the spending that the
entities are doing are is effective and
that's what the audit will get to the
bottom of in addition it covers what
time and resource our law enforcement
agencies are having to spend and talking
to local law enforcement in Athens a
significant portion of their time is
spent related to homelessness
homelessness and so that's I think a
really important component of this bill
is the audit of spending and then
finally what representative Townsend
just talked through is is the the issue
that we've seen in Athens and I know he
talked about it in his community where
other hospitals and other local
governments are taking homeless
individuals and dropping them off in
other communities where there's not been
an agreement from a homeless shelter not
been agreement from a family member to
accept that individual it happened
actually just a couple of weeks a weeks
ago in Athens and a business owner in
our community called and shared what
happened to him on his doorstep in the
middle of the day a homeless individual
was dropped off from a neighboring
County and that's a real challenge for
our community as representative town has
shared the services that his district
has we certainly have those in Athens
and it's not right for individuals it's
not right for that individual and it's
not right for the community for
individuals to just be dropped off and
so that's what this bill will address
and again just want to thank chair
Dempsey for her great leadership on this
on Senate Bill 62 and ask for the body's
favorable consideration Mr Speaker I
yield the well
the gentleman has yielded well that
completes the comments in favor of the
proposition well let's see let's move on
to is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered that
Jerry has done the previous question is
ordered we do have a Minority Report
that will have up to 20 minutes
you will all police yourselves on your
time
represent Stacy Evans is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and colleagues I
rise in opposition to Senate Bill 62 not
because I don't think it has a good goal
behind it
I applaud the lady who brought the bill
I know her heart is in the right place
and I know she wants to help
I just think this is misguided
I also don't want to be like Los Angeles
I have no desire for that
I've had frustrations just like many
others especially those of us who spend
every day and not just the first three
months of the year in the city
with homelessness it's very frustrating
and it's heart-wrenching because it is a
really hard difficult issue to deal with
one that can't be solved or pretended to
be understood
with a five-page bill written from above
I own a home on Piedmont and fourth
right and right straddles downtown in
Midtown my husband and I use it as an
office house so we're not there a lot
we often come into the office and find
visitors on our porch and
we speak with law enforcement we work
with our neighbors trying to get
resources for the individuals who find
themselves on our porch
and there's no there's no solution it
keeps happening when I first got elected
to the district that I represent now
I was faced immediately with
questions from all of my neighborhoods
almost you got to do something about the
people sleeping under the underpasses
you got to do something about them
so I talked to g-dot and I say what can
we do about the homelessness camps under
the underpasses how do we make sure
people get resources to be treated with
the dignity that they deserved how do we
move them toward resources to help them
and how do we keep our neighborhoods
safe because we don't want
the things that sometimes come with
groups of people sleeping Outdoors that
are not meant for human habitation
it's hard what I'm told is it costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars to move
people somewhere else
and where do we move them
and then they come back
and then your do-gooder neighbors this
is what I was told
bring them blankets and bring them food
because
they're human beings as has been said in
this well what else would the Lord have
us do there but for the grace of God go
I that's what we think and we want to
help our neighbors So This is
complicated
and it begs for nuance the lady from
Decatur
brought up the great Point what if you
have multiple counties and some
unincorporated areas in some cities
what's allowed under this bill and
what's not we can't say that
prosecutorial discretion has been
discussed
how how could we tell the city of
Atlanta that a lot of us in here have
been you know saying or doing it the
wrong way you're not prioritizing
violent crime now we're telling them
they've got to prioritize folks sleeping
on the street why do we have to control
everything
what if somebody came in here and asked
us about our priorities
how would we like that other elected
officials telling us we're not doing it
the right way instead of passing and
proposing glad we haven't passed it yet
instead of proposing a voucher Bill why
don't you rewrite the quality basic
education funding formula that hasn't
been Rewritten since Joe Frank Harris
was governor before I started school
some people might have a problem with
that priority why are we relying on
toddlers to learn how to hide from
active Shooters instead of hearing gun
safety bills
why are we not dealing with the fentanyl
crisis that we talked about this morning
how did that not become a priority
ladies and gentlemen
here's what I say
and I'm talking to members of my own
party as much as anybody when I say this
when people say why aren't you doing
something about this why aren't you
doing that why can't you do more on this
win elections
if you want to do something about the
city of Atlanta's homelessness situation
how about you move your butt to Atlanta
and run for office
how about you get yourself elected to
the city council you want to say have a
say in what DA's and solicitors spend
their time on
go get a law degree and run
but you let them do their job let's do
our job because ladies and gentlemen
there's a lot that we can do from this
body to address homelessness
wages
landlord tenant policies that haven't
made their way all the way across to the
governor's desk we've got things that we
can do that nobody else can do DA's
can't do it City councils can't do it
County commissions can't do it let's
stop trying to do their job and do ours
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well represent
representative Willis is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I rise today in opposition to Senate
bill 62.
I'm certain that that comes as no
surprise
colleagues greetings
I live in a district affected by
homelessness I live in the city of
Atlanta
I live in a district
that during the pandemic students sat in
McDonald's parking lots to get Wi-Fi to
do their homework I live in a district
where this decision matters and I ask
that you consider what matters in the
districts of your colleagues
it was the best of times number one
place to do business
it was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom and it was the
age of foolishness
it was the season of light and the
season of Darkness the spring of Hope
and it was the season of Despair example
in this the people's house we most
agreeably salute our veterans we proudly
stand daily during session to do so
thanking them for their service as we
should and their sacrifice to this
country yet according to the veterans
administration there are 725 veterans in
the state of Georgia living in the state
of homelessness
725 Heroes the Senate study committee on
unsheltered homelessness released a
final report with 26 findings and its
recommendations of these findings and
recommendations
62 only implements one one
micromanaging jurisdictions does not
address the root causes of homelessness
but only manages again its symptoms if
the general assembly truly wants to help
it would Instead address the affordable
housing crisis raise the minimum wage
expand Medicaid and increase the state
funding for the Department of Community
Affairs
we have each made a commitment to solve
for issues and it is my hope that this
body would recognize when we have more
work to do and not rest with Senate Bill
62. work with me toward a comprehensive
solution we promised Georgia that we
would fight for all of them including
our homeless population I leave you with
these words by Robert Frost the woods
are lovely dark and deep but I have
promises to keep and miles to go before
I sleep and miles to go before I sleep
for I have promises to keep and miles to
go before I sleep Mr Speaker I yield
back the well
lady has yielded well representing
Barnes is recommended to speak
recognized to speak
speaker
good afternoon colleagues
I stand today in opposition of SB 62.
I'll start mine off with a story and
I'll be really brief
I represent house District 86 which
encompasses
Tucker and a couple of other other
cities that goes further south
and Tucker the the
part that I represented Tucker has a lot
of Extended Stays hotels and I see a lot
of homeless
around that area on the streets on the
sidewalk
this bill will take the jurisdiction
away from the cities and put it in our
hands and I believe Tucker knows the
best way to address Tucker's
homelessness problem
so riding around in December when it was
below freezing we had a big freeze here
in Georgia and everyone in their right
mind needed to be in the house
I took it upon myself to ride around my
district and make sure that the homeless
in my district knew where the shelters
were because it was inhumane to stay out
in the cold at the time
as I rode around and saw the homeless I
pulled over to give them blankets out of
my trunk or direct them to the shelters
and many of them said they did not want
to go to the shelters it was
imperative for people to be inside
during this time because it was way
below freezing and they still told me
they did not want to go to the shelter
so that's not uh just a homelessness
issue that is a mental health issue
I couldn't drive them myself to the
shelter because mentally they weren't
prepared to understand that this is
unhealthy to stay in these in this low
temperature
so I asked that we oppose SB 62 and
let's focus on the mental health of
these people let's find other options uh
the the sidewalks are are not created
equal believe it or not our sidewalks
are not equal because there are some
communities where the sidewalks are
barely used and a homeless person on the
sidewalk would not be a problem to
anybody it wouldn't be making a problem
to anyone in other communities sidewalks
there aren't any sidewalks so where are
the people supposed to go and if we do
pass this bill we will be maybe
exacerbating crime by taking them off
the sidewalks they're going to go to
private properties to to to find a
shelter and we don't want that so I ask
that we oppose this bill and come back
to the table and try to come up with
other Solutions rather than
criminalizing the homeless in our state
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
representative Al Williams has
recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
this was not planned I've listened
and I'm usually very joyful
but today I just come as a human being
I've heard some interesting things that
have been said and I understand
sometimes how the problem it is because
I know I have been guilty
of forgetting
human beings
it was a state senator Renee Kemp
I mean I would go under the bridges
and just hear some stories on what got
you here
and what I've found
and and and and and thank you
representative Townsend
it's very interesting what you had to
say
I've found that unfortunately
the vast majority of the people under
the bridges who we're talking about I
think this this is not these are not
eviction people these are people
sometimes who's never had a house
these are chronically homeless people
who people have stopped looking at as
people
and I found myself passing by there's no
guy on Capitol Avenue I passed him by
and one morning I was convicted and some
of you know what I mean I turned around
went back and gave him something
my friend representative Mack Jackson
keeps
a bunch of envelopes
the scripture in them and some money
unfortunately most of us have not done
anything for those who are chronically
homeless
and my only problem I have several but
my problem with where we are right now
is I think we're ahead I think that
instead of a bill
we should be having a study committee
where people can look at
what's happening and try and design a
way to help somebody
not to criminalize them the unfortunate
truth is
a great percentage of these folk are
veterans
and they have mental problems and most
people on those bridges have mental
problems these are not the shiftless
these are folk who have not gotten it
together and have lost their way some of
them have had good careers and they just
got lost
we don't even be talking about how we
jail and we need to be talking about how
we're going to help them
got to figure out a way
the preacher said this morning and he
was great
he talked about help
and how we pre-judge people and I kind
of pre-judged him I didn't know he could
preach like he was preaching he was
Dynamite I didn't think it was going to
say much Madame Pro Temp but he was one
of the best
that did you do to the least of mine
you do also unto me
this is an issue that we need to take a
look at as a state as a bipartisan State
and it hadn't got to be packed with a
bunch of experts who think they have all
the answers it needs to be packed with
people who have compassion for other
people and want to find a solution to a
problem I'm from a little town called
Midway folk I know the water tastes like
cherry wine now most of you are not
fortunate enough to live in Midway
but we have a few homeless in Hinesville
it Grieves me when a person is fouled in
Vietnam in Iraq Afghanistan
come home
and have lost their way and now they
have
a chance of being jailed
compassion
too many fancy churches around don't
want folk who are dirty and out of place
even walking on the sidewalk in front of
the church thank God for Central and it
doesn't look good but somebody got to
figure out how to help these people and
helping them is not putting them in jail
helping them is addressing the issue as
a state
chronically I'm not talking about those
who won't pay their rent if they had the
money I'm talking about those who are
lost in a sea of depression
and we owe it and if you don't pay it
you will pay it one day because that
that you do to the least of mine you do
also unto me
the gentleman has left the well
representative Bruce is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I too uh decided to
make these comments at the last minute
but as my colleague mentioned a moment
ago about us meeting with the governor
several years ago this is not a new
subject for me
and um it's it is personal you know a
lot of times people you know they tell
us don't come up here and make it
personal but it is personal when you see
somebody on the street and
um
you can't help them the way they need to
be helped this uh Senate Bill 62 is just
another hate-filled bill
you know people don't like to just be
candid but you got to be candid it's a
hate-filled bill a bill to punish people
for helping people who need help
that is mean that's just not the right
spirit for any of us here many of us
in this room you may not want to admit
it but some of you are probably one or
two paychecks away from being homeless
yourself
you know you we we nobody wakes up in
the morning and says I can't wait
to get out
in the rain
I can't wait
to get out
with no bathroom anywhere nearby
I just want to sleep on the street
nobody does that
people are on the street for all kinds
of reasons and many of them you'll never
understand if you've never been out on
the street yourself
why do all of our bills everything we
seem to do down here
our bills are focused on punishing
somebody
they're focused on doing things to
somebody for doing something they're not
focused on how can we help
and I think we need to start looking at
it differently you know all you new
people that are here
you know think about changing the way we
do things here and focus on how do we
help people instead of how do we hurt
people
I know I'm running out of time I had a
lot more I wanted to say but this thing
reminds me of
two movies
that came out
you know in years past
one was called Trading Places
I don't know if you remember that movie
with Eddie Murphy
you know where they where two rich
people took a bet on whether they could
change
a a person on the street and get them
where they could be a useful Citizen and
the other one was to get a rich person
and put them on the street I don't know
if you remember that movie but that that
kind of is what it is you know we cannot
take the attitude that we can't help
because we can in the other movie it was
where those same two rich people were on
the street and a rich King came along
and gave them a hand and they the the
the punch line was we're back you don't
remember that that movie
you know it we we've got to reach out we
got to give a hand to people who need
help
and I'm getting a signal there
the bottom line to this in the words of
my seat mate
you know she she wanted me to make it
clear
gentlemen you have 30 seconds okay and
I'm just going to end it with her with
her statement
that we have to
help people
not hurt people and we cannot make
people who are in need criminals thank
you very much Mr Speaker and I hear the
well
gentlemen's yield of the well
that completes the Minority Report now
we'll move on to the chairs time
the chair at the committee that passes
legislation out
chairman lahood
speak to the bill is recognized
thank you Mr Speaker
I'm going to make a few points and I'll
give the rest of my time to the sponsor
of the bill but first I'd like to just
start and uh say that
I've submit my entire professional
career helping others serving others
many of the people that I've served my
professional and personal life are
people who can't help themselves
so I understand compassion
this bill the main premise of this bill
is to
audit
the funding that's been given to this
issue
Let's do an audit and let's see how the
effect of the funding's been so that we
can know if we need to do more of that
or do something different that's just
transparency to me
that makes sense
it's been said that no one wants to be
homeless
you know I agree I don't think anybody
wakes up one day and decides they want
to be homeless and goes and chooses that
but I think there are people who are
choosing
um
not to do something different that can
improve their situation
did you know that approximately 50
percent of the shelter beds in Atlanta
are vacant
a couple of weeks ago a constituent of
mine in Valdosta Georgia called me and
said John this is a merchant who owns a
a store downtown Valdosta
she's about 75 years old and had this
door there for about 20 years
she went to open the store one morning
and there was a piece of cardboard
laying outside the door
and she just thought to herself well
this looks bad
in front of my store let me picked this
up well she picked it up
and somebody jumped up almost knocked
her down
and ran away as as he was you know just
spewing profanities at her
for waking him up this was a 20 or 30
something year old Caucasian male
and it was very disturbing to her well
uh he so he he left got out of sight so
she proceeded to clean up the the
cardboard and other debris that had been
placed there uh
since she left closed the store the day
before well she went down to get a bag
and went to throw it away and realized
that she had picked up a bag of feces
now this isn't good for business
and it's also not good for this young
man who's sleeping outside under a piece
of cardboard let's give him some help
let's do something this bill doesn't
have every single answer but it's a
start
to me that's compassion
we don't we want to be sure that the
cities in this state don't become like
Los Angeles and Austin Texas where we
encourage people
to sleeping on the street
let's do something about it let's let's
start the process and um and gain more
clarity on what's Happening so we'll
know what to do and do better
we're not criminalizing poverty
we're looking for Solutions Mr Speaker
I'd like to yield the rest of my time to
the sponsor of the bill
Dempsey is recognized to speak the bill
and take the remaining time or as much
as she deems necessary
thank you Mr Speaker I want to say thank
you to everybody
there is a seriousness in this room that
I can feel this matters
it matters in different ways to all of
us and I respect you for that I don't
always have to agree to still offer my
respect to your viewpoints and what you
are thinking
there have been a lot of assumptions
made I want to say first of all I have
homeless people in my community Rome is
not that small
we all have them some are more visible
than others but they are everywhere it
is a pervasive problem and that is what
this measure is about
many of the things that have been stated
here this afternoon are way off of
anything that is in this bill
it does not address those measures
intentionally this is not to solve
homelessness it is to help our get our
hands our eyes our brains around it and
understand the true challenge we spend
hundreds of millions of dollars you have
done it in the amended budget you will
do it here again shortly to address many
of the things that each of you have
brought up as concerns that is not
specifically what we are trying to do
here we're going to continue to respect
that spending and we want to make sure
we do it with accountable responsibility
and every opportunity that we have I
want to make one thing clear too before
I say a few more things this measure
passed in the Senate and one of the most
unique votes I've ever seen every single
member was on the floor when I started
looking that doesn't happen all that
often every single person voted on it
it passed 49 to 7. one Republican voted
against it and six Democrats this
measure passed over there with that this
is a non-partisan humanitarian caring
Bill and nothing else
there's been said that it would
criminalize homelessness that's not what
it is it is not about poverty it is not
about criminalizing homelessness is it
about the reality of understanding the
circumstances that we are in across our
state and the resources we have to look
at it this bill is not even in the
criminal code look at the code sections
please
it's title 36 Title 31 title 50. this is
about local government this is about
health
this is not and about the state
government excuse me it is not criminal
implications for this at all
this is about absolutely acting with
your heart
it opens the door for us to do more it
opens the door for us to do some of the
things that you have talked about
whether it is the minimum wage or Better
Health Care
leave whatever it may be supportive
housing is the number one thing we have
but we cannot afford to have enough
Supportive Housing opportunities for all
of the homeless people in our state so
what are the steps we can do to
understand who they are where they are
what their needs are yes there's no
doubt there's compounding mental health
for 12 years I have chaired that portion
of the budget
I know what I'm talking about I'm not
trying to be
in any way
blameful I'm not trying to pick on
anyone neither have any of the members
of my committee each and every time we
look at the budget and we figure out how
much can we come up with to go into
mental health into addiction into
developmental disabilities
into matters that affect many of the
reasons why certain people today
find themselves without a stable housing
opportunity
we need to know what it is so we can
address it
I know I was asked about line 44-46 all
that that does and makes is make it
clear that a municipality cannot adopt
or enforce a written policy to not
enforce their existing existing
ordinance it does nothing more than that
they must do it if you have it you must
do it we're not saying you have to have
it
it's up to that Community to decide if
they should have it
also I want to address another concern
that I think is pretty much on the minds
of many and I will ask you to look at
line 75 through 76.
that talks about where no County or
Municipal corporation political
subdivision local Authority or other
local government units shall drop off
now let's talk about what dropping off
is
known to be a homeless individual
outside of its jurisdiction here's the
big word unless
look at that unless there are two
exceptions that matter
such drop off is in the county where
that homeless person was a resident
prior to coming under the custody
controller care of a receiving
or receiving treatment from such local
government or authority or or please
hear this now that drop-off is at a
facility with a person business or
organization that has agreed to accept
that individual we are talking about
opening the door and dropping someone
off on the street with no resources
that's what this measure stops you
cannot go to your neighboring county and
say just because we have so many we're
going to share this person with you
or just because this is such a constant
challenge we're going to share we need
that help that's not what it does the
bill is very plain very straightforward
as I said for a very complicated
passionate and deservingly compassionate
reason
as I said I do have homeless people I do
care greatly about this I've worked on
it for years nothing has come from above
it has come from here it's come from
here it's come from here it's come from
listening it's come from the people that
come before my committee and talk when
we are in subcommittee I asked for a
study committee on this the senate had
one I've listened to everything they
heard this is not intended to solve it
it is intended to help us get a start on
understanding what we can do and in the
meantime while we're trying to do that
to not let others invade our own
communities to play fair
let's all pick up and take care of all
the people that we can the goal is yes
to get everyone into a much better
situation than this
but we have to walk and the reality of
the massive challenge that we are facing
now it's not just driving away from here
like I said it's every rural community
you will go to Community Kitchens you
will go to shelters you will go to
churches all over this state that
realize the challenge and that want with
all of their heart to make it better and
we owe it to them
to come forward and to help so if you
truly genuinely care about not seeing
someone
like chairman Hood said where you think
it's just cardboard but actually there's
a person under there if you truly think
that it's okay to put a tent up when
it's almost 100 degrees or almost 10
degrees in Georgia
then you should absolutely vote to not
do this
if you want to address the concerns not
fix them all but begin to understand
them all
and help your own Community do that then
I ask you to vote Yes this is not a
partisan issue it is a very heartfelt
issue
Mr Speaker I feel like people have made
up their minds so I'm going to ask now
to yield the well I know there's times
for parliamentary questions as we leave
this
but I would ask you all to think very
seriously and to help us help so that
next year when we come back
and we start on the budget again we have
some more facts and we're better
equipped and we're ready to do it thank
you Mr Speaker I yield the well

for what purpose is representing Bernal
rise
parliamentary inquiry staging inquiry
Mr Speaker is it not true that the money
that we're talking about auditing is the
money from the federal government that
the state does not give any money for
homelessness
I'm sure the lady believes in what she
speaks
I'm going to take a couple more we've
debated this issue for a long time this
afternoon I want to recognize for what
purposes representative Roberts rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
isn't it true that this bill allows the
Attorney General to sue our cities and
counties for prioritizing their often
limited resources to address violent
crime over homelessness and recover from
those County and City taxpayers the AGS
litigation expenses including attorneys
fees which we have no idea what his
billable rate is going to be
investigative costs witness fees and is
it further true that this micromanaging
of our cities and counties is only going
to hurt the people of Georgia and will
desperately impact the Metro Atlanta
jurisdictions where homelessness is more
prevalent
I'm sure this ladies so states she was
had a very well thought out
parliamentary inquiry
so let's see for what purpose does
representative chair lady Houston rise
is isn't it not true that I live in a
room is this a parliamentary inquiry
parliamentary inquiry yes ma'am State's
inquiry isn't it not true that I live in
a rural area where people have to go to
McDonald's the library if they want to
get Wi-Fi
and isn't it not true that I have a
homeless camp
about uh I'd say 400 feet from where I
live
and isn't it not true that uh I have
been working to get something done about
the homeless count and I am
so excited that we're going to order
different monies that come into this
state because I want my homeless people
in my district to get every cent they're
due for and isn't it not true yes ma'am
that if the federal government does
audit it I hope they do a lot better job
auditing the homeless than they did on
the Workforce Development and if anybody
has had any experience with the auditing
they've done they would want the state
to do the auditing thank you Mr Speaker
I'm sure you're probably inquiry is well
thought out too and I know the lady does
have a big heart and I know that's to be
true
I'm gonna take two more
for what purpose does representative
main arise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker State
your inquiry is it not true that this
bill although it does make some prohibit
prohibitions on local ordinances it does
not necessarily change how police
officers will police meaning if they are
homeless on the street if a police
officer does not arrest them which
they're not doing now this bill is not
going to all of a sudden make police
officers arrest homeless and
additionally Mr Speaker
August 2022 last year Governor Kemp did
distribute 62 million dollars of federal
funds for homelessness but for my
district the city of Atlanta the state
gave nearly one million dollars to
homeless programs but I have no way of
knowing where that nearly one million
dollars went to but with this bill I can
at least see the audit to know where
that million dollars went to is that not
true
sounds true to me at the lady so States
two more
what purposes representing Vermont rise
parliamentary inquiry please State your
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker is it not
true that although the auditing
component of this bill is incredibly
important there are other portions of
this bill that the speakers opposing
this bill have spoken to particularly
regarding criminalizing homelessness
because at the end of the day if you
know that the Attorney General is going
to step in and prosecute a case that
they believe you should have prosecuted
and you don't want to spend the money on
that you're going to be incentivized to
prosecute that case particularly as it
relates to homelessness
if the lady so States
for what purpose does chairman Knight
Rise
parliamentary stage inquiry isn't it
true Mr Speaker that Griffin Spalding
County
is the subject to The Dumping if you
will that was mentioned in the prior
speaker in the bills
further State further inquiry further
inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true that
many counties surrounding us
including Henry Clayton and other
counties are bringing homeless to
Spalding County and is creating
a Havoc is creating crime and is one of
the most uh the biggest issues that our
locals have come and spoken to its local
delegation about
if the gentleman slows States

will will lock the machine

15 to the fiscal to Georgia annotated
relating the general Provisions
regarding Prosecuting attorneys so as to
create the prosecuting attorney's
oversight commission as Bill Evans refer
to the committee on Judiciary non-civil
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass by committee substitute
the gentleman from the 19th house
District representative gullet is
recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
this is I rise today to present house
bill I mean sorry Senate Bill 92 this is
something that we've passed a number of
times in this body in the last
two years I think this is the fifth vote
on the house floor for this bill
what this does is create a a prosecuting
attorney's qualifications Commission uh
we used to call it prosecuting
attorney's oversight commission but it's
a qualifications Commission
um and it's the bill is very similar to
what our bill was house bill 231.
um the commission will be made up of
five members just like before three
members five members of an investigative
panel three members of a hearing panel
again the investigative panel is
responsible for the investigative
prosecutorial and administrative
functions of the commission hearing
panels responsible for adjudicating
formal charges filed by the
investigative panel issuing disciplinary
and incapacity orders issuing formal
advisory opinions issuing standards of
the commission
we have grounds for removal and it's
very Nero
um and if there's a complaint there must
be a sworn affidavit detailing the
personal knowledge of the facts
um supporting the complaint
if there's disciplinary action that can
be appealed to the superior court of the
county where the district attorney or
solicitor general served
Additionally the bill adjusts the duties
of the D.A and solicitors to include
reviewing each and every individual case
for which probable cause exists
and make a prosecutorial decision based
on the cases specific facts and
circumstances
that's what this bill does I'm happy to
answer any questions I know again this
is the fifth time we voted on it in the
last two years the second time this year
so I can answer any questions Mr Speaker
gentleman has a question a few Yules I
will representative Roberts right out in
front of you to your left thank you Mr
Speaker will the gentleman yield I will
or do you know if the sponsor of this
bill filed a fiscal note with this bill
this term
um I don't know that from I don't know
if Senator Robertson filed a fiscal note
for this term no I do not know okay
thank you
to your left representative Jasmine
Clark has a question ladies recognized
thank you Mr Speaker just gentleman
yield I do you kind of glossed over it
so I just want to be clear what exactly
are the terms in which a prosecutor or a
solicitor general could be removed under
this
um so it starts at line 197. it's a
mental or physical incapacity
interfering with the performance of his
or her duties which is or is likely to
become permanent willful misconduct in
office willful and persistent failure to
perform his or her duties as described
by law
conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude
conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice which brings
the officer to disrepute and knowingly
authorizing or permitting an ADA or
assistant sister
General to commit commit any act
constituting grounds for removal
did you turn my further yield I will all
right so um I appreciate you laying
those out um that in my opinion is not
very narrow because some of this feels
like it could be broad is this based on
Whose interpretation so as far as like
um willful and persistent failure to
carry out duties does that include not
wanting to prosecute certain things
because maybe they just don't have the
capacity or like who decides what's
willful and persistent failure to carry
out their duties yeah so the commission
will write those rules and decide what
that is and then if there's an appeal
because I didn't like it a superior
court and like and from on there the
Appellate Court and Supreme Court rule
will decide what that is thank you
gentlemen yield representative nilowitz
to your left has a question okay thank
you to the gentleman yield sure can you
give us a little more elimination into
what exactly comprises moral turpitude
more turpitude so I think that's when
you do uh
immoral acts I think that there are like
sexual harassment I think would fall
into that
um but I'm you know you probably know
did you tell me what you think moral for
people actually don't this is this is a
genuine question because it's it's it's
it's a phrase that pops up sure
throughout zero to code but I haven't
been able to find a clear definition to
what exactly moral turpitude is it
reminds me of that Supreme Court Justice
saying well you know I don't want to say
it sure yeah but I didn't know if we
actually had a definition or if it's
something that
if the gentleman further yields we could
just say
Jacquees moral turpitude
I don't know what that means but yeah um
so
too sounds French
gentleman has one more question I'll
yield for one more
chairman Collins right straight up the
center Isle has a question recognize for
a question chairman this gentleman yield
I do
to my friend in the world was it not
true that I'm going to be supporting
this bill because when I was mayor of my
little Community we had a portion of a
county where the DEA acted like the
south end of a Northbound mu a lot of
times and he ultimately wound up
resigning and had a non-prosecution
prosecution agreement with the gbi and
because of if we had a legislation like
this in place
was not true that he would have probably
been removed from office long before the
gbi ever got him is that not true
that I believe I believe to speak the
truth that this is something that I'm
also supporting because I had a district
attorney who continued to sex the
arrests one of his one of his employees
and um it brought the office into
distribute no one trusted the judicial
system in my county and the only reason
he got caught was because he lied to
deposition about something else and so
it caused a lot of problems for
communities who have DA's who do this
most DA's are good but the ones that are
bad this gives them a tool with that Mr
Speaker I appreciate the time and the
consideration of this body and I yield
the well
gentleman has yielded the well
we have speakers in favor and opposed to
this proposition
we will allow up to 30 minutes for each
opinion so we'll start with
representative Tanya Miller to speak to
the mill the representative is
recognized ladies and gentlemen lady
will suspend just for a moment before we
begin
foreign
give the lady in your world your
attention
lady will proceed
thank you Mr Speaker
um good afternoon colleagues I rise
today to speak in opposition to SB 92 we
have vetted
um the versions of these prosecutor
bills uh quite thoroughly so I will not
belabor points that have already been
made and I will tell you that when I ran
for this seat
um
and vowed to represent and support and
fight for malign minority groups in the
state I did not anticipate that that
might be prosecutors or elected DA's but
sadly it seems that that is a place that
we are at
I will say this quickly this bill is not
only
unnecessary it undermines democracy by
silencing local voices while really
doing nothing at all to make our
community safer or to remove violent
criminals from our streets which is
really really really important work
it is really the kind of thing we should
be most focused on when we are talking
about Public Safety in Atlanta alone in
2022
170 of our citizens were killed by gun
violence 85 of those were children
we ought to really be focused in on the
things that will make our communities
safer and of course this just simply is
not one of them
instead some have argued
that this is a power grab by the
majority party to usurp
the will of the voters
by putting this body in the business of
overseeing duly elected prosecutors
throughout our state
this will make us an outlier State as
the vast majority of states in our Union
including southern states do not have
such a commission
there were only three that I'm aware of
Indiana Connecticut and New York
for decades we have coexisted and even
exalted the work of prosecutors
they were not our enemies
and we would be remiss if we did not
address therefore the elephant in the
room
that there were 14 newly elected
minority district attorneys in this
state since 2020.
and they in fact represent between their
districts the majority of this state's
population
whether intended or not this
extraordinary measure will be viewed by
the world as a reaction to this
that simply should not be who we are in
Georgia nor should it be the impression
that we signal to the world make no
mistake this is not a public safety bill
it is as many have criticized including
our elected District Attorneys a
political weapon
weaponized against someone else's chosen
prosecutor today
and perhaps your chosen prosecutor
tomorrow
if SB 92 passes it will grow state
government by Paving the way for
politically motivated oversight
that is because the folks who do the
appointments are politicians
those will be those individuals who will
have power under this board
will be able to remove locally elected
DA's and solicitors from office
the party and Power in the state of
Georgia whether it is Democratic or
republican should not be engaged in the
business of usurping the will of the
People by creating such a politically
potentially politically motivated
commission funded by taxpayer dollars
50 DA's
50.
the vast majority of which are honest
dedicated public servants we are
actually prepared today to spend upwards
of seven figures
of taxpayer dollars
to create a commission that we are
already well eclipped equipped to handle
to deal with a problem that we are
already well equipped to handle it is a
commission simply put we do not need
we have processes in place to deal with
Wayward prosecutors every Wayward
prosecutor that has been brought up
as motivating this bill have already
been dealt with by the processes we have
in place
the Attorney General can of course
indict any prosecutor who violates his
oath of office a far more streamlined
process
those folks can then be removed by our
governor immediately upon indictment
you can recall DA's who commit who
commit violations of their oath of
office or misconduct you can bring them
literally before the voters as a result
of their violations or misconduct they
are subject to Bar rules that govern
lawyers and can be subject to disbarment
for violation of their ethical duties
a disbar D.A cannot practice law
this body of course has the
Constitutional power to impeach
District Attorneys I've heard that
although we have the power it is
enshrined in our constitution it's
something that we haven't done in a long
time and therefore it makes sense to
spend upwards of a million dollars in
taxpayer Monies to create
a commission with a process that will be
cumbersome that will not be streamlined
that will drag on and on as Appeals
and arguments are made by their lawyers
all of this pulling DA's from their ever
important job of keeping us safe and
being focused on that
and lastly every four years every
elected district attorney has a
referendum
and if they have failed the people the
people will send them home packing
now we have heard some of us in our
committees have heard prosecutors and
Law Enforcement Officers talk about the
challenge of recruiting and maintaining
talent and our ever important field of
Public Safety
this bill will exacerbate the problem by
creating a mechanism whereby any person
a person not even in the prosecutor's
District not even a taxpayer a victim
not even someone from the state of
Georgia
can file a complaint against a
prosecutor requiring that district
attorney to take their eyes off the
wheels of Public Safety and crime
fighting to hire a lawyer and prepare
responses and defenses to a commission's
inquiry that's right
the way that this bill is drafted
someone in California can file a
complaint against a district attorney in
Georgia
that might require that district
attorney to take their hands off the
wheel of doing the work that their
communities have sent them there to do
to answer to inquiries to hire a lawyer
to not be focused on the critical things
that have sent them to office
now I have heard as I as I wrap up
I've heard a lot from my friends across
the aisle
about the importance of local government
control
for instance voters in one County may
not favor electing a D.A who believes
that accountability courts are a proper
means of justice for drug crimes or
non-violent felonies whereas voters in
another jurisdiction May support a D.A
who believes that is the best option to
redress certain violations
but in neither case in neither case
should we substitute our judgment for
that of local voters
ask yourself as you press your button
if you really believe it's a good idea
for the political party in power
whichever party that may be
to have the ability
to overtake and usurp the will of Voters
every Community is unique local
prosecutors and local voters know the
needs of their communities better than
we do
also it is a frightening proposition it
should be
to place oversight over prosecutors in
the hands of electives who can and do
sometimes wield their power for
political purposes
the political platform of my colleagues
the party in charge currently States
quote we believe that our constitutional
system of limited government separation
of powers federalism and the rights of
people must be preserved uncompromised
for future Generations
SB 92 violates this standard while
unnecessarily growing government by
creating this massive expensive
duplicative mandate
and as the Forsyth County solicitor Bill
Finch said during our Committee hearing
this bill doesn't pass the bar for GOP
standards which are quote limited
government local control fiscal
responsibility and respect
for The Ballot Box
I challenge my colleagues who are
supporting this bill to instead trust
voters
and support local prosecutors by making
sure they have the tools the training
and the funding to do their jobs to
actually be about the work of making our
community safer thank you Mr Speaker I
yield
a lady has yielded the well
representative Yasmine Neal is
recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr speaker thank you
colleagues I rise today
to oppose Senate bill 92.
we have been here before and I don't
want to delay with a point but like I
mentioned prior before we move forward
with this measure we really
need to
I really encourage those that desire to
address problematic prosecutors to
exhaust the means that we currently have
because as was testified in committee
all options have not been exhausted
the State Bar
the AG bringing charges
voters voting out problematic
prosecutors and bringing articles of
impeachment to this body which as we've
testified before has not been done since
the 1960s
why not try that why not try something
that we haven't done in over 50 plus
years because it just might work let's
exhaust all of our options first
and based on the testimony that was
brought before our committee most of the
problematic prosecutors have been
removed or voted out
the citizens did their job the people
that became problems they voted them out
so before we ask taxpayers
to pay for yet another process
we should exhaust current options
so with that join me in Saving taxpayer
dollars in opposing Senate bill 92. and
Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
that concludes remarks of those opposed
to sb99 our
recognize representing Maynor to speak
to the bill
representative Maynard
there are three folks signed up to speak
to the bill
y'all will have to manage your own time
representative Manor
thank you Mr Speaker this is going to be
really quick because we did talk about
this already
I want to just speak from the voice of a
citizen or citizens
there are many different things that you
can do if you are having trouble with
the prosecutor but as a citizen does not
necessarily it's not necessarily easy
for a citizen so the things that were
mentioned Chris Carr can prosecute
attorney general Chris Carr can
prosecute well first it has to be a
crime which means local police would
have to investigate the D.A which
they're not going to do in order for
their to be a crime for attorney general
Chris Carr to look into that the second
thing with that is
someone mentioned you can do a bar
complaint
citizens I've done a bar complaint it's
not an easy thing to do a barking plane
you have to go through hundreds of pages
to try to understand as a non-lawyer
what is the codes that you believe the
attorney has violated that is not easy
for a lay citizen to do so that really
is not an option you mentioned a
referendum
referendums are not necessarily easy
especially if it's in a community where
it's high poverty low graduation rates
um
food deserts and the sort the knowledge
base there to Galvanize and do a
referendum that is just not something
that is done in communities where
they've never even heard of a referendum
sometimes another thing that someone
mentioned is impeaching
this since I have been here what I have
learned is that elected officials
stick with elected officials it's like a
camaraderie we are we are all
family here but we also know that we're
up here at the state to do a job
sometimes at other local levels of
government
there is a code where people will turn
the other cheek if they see a comrade
doing something that they should not be
doing
I am voting yes for SB 92
because they are citizens that have
contacted me that have problems with
prosecutors
we have our ethics board that is our
oversight judges they have their
oversight board school boards they have
an oversight board
former president Donald Trump he had the
January 6
committee
prosecutors don't have that so why it is
a bad thing for someone to give
oversight to someone
the only person people that do not like
that are the prosecutors but what about
the citizens has anybody had a phone
call from citizens that said my
prosecutor didn't do this my prosecutor
didn't do this the last time I was up
here in the well I mentioned about
10 or 15 different people
families that lost loved ones to police
violence that prosecutors did not
prosecute
let's give at least those people those
families an opportunity
to get Justice thank you I yield the
will
the lady has yielded the well
representative Gaines is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker like the speakers
before I'll be brief because I know we
have talked about this issue before this
session but also in previous sessions
and again want to thank representative
gullet for his great leadership bringing
this bill forward and the house house
bill 231 Senator Robertson Senate Bill
92 and getting us to this point and I'm
excited and looking forward to us
getting this bill over the finish line
here today I do want to respond to a
couple comments have been brought
forward the first comment that that
frankly I found outrageous was that this
bill was brought as a result of minority
candidates being elected across the
state
this bill was brought because we have
District Attorneys and prosecutors who
aren't doing their job I told you all
last time this bill was on the house
floor House Bill 231 about the district
attorney in the Western Judicial Circuit
and the issues that we've had in
Athens-Clarke County and Oconee County
well since then just a couple weeks ago
there have been more issues brought
forward about our district attorney
there was even a rid of mandamus filed
in court trying to get her to Simply do
her job
as part of that rid of mandamus there
was additional evidence brought forward
I already told you about the letter from
our four Superior Court judges simply
asking her to show up to court and do
her job we also have a letter from a
police officer where he expressed to her
his absolute disgust with her
performance in a case
so the judges the law enforcement
officers the community lawyers
there's an issue after issue after issue
now 35 prosecutors have resigned from
that office that's the equivalent of
every every single position that office
resigning twice over the last two years
35 resignations that we've seen so the
other comment to wrap this up that I
heard was this is this bill was not
brought for Public Safety that's the
whole point of this bill is to restore
Public Safety in places where you have
Rogue District Attorneys who simply are
not doing their job that's what we've
seen the Western Judicial Circuit it's
happening in other places throughout
this state and I think Senate Bill 92 is
one of the most important measures we
can pass this session look forward to
getting over the finish line Thank you
Mr Speaker I yield the well
gentleman has yielded the well
we do have a minority report for up to
20 minutes
represent darshan Kendrick is recognized
to present The Minority Report
and then allocate the time with the
other speakers
thank you Mr Speaker
promise when I say it when I got my
voice back that you will hear more from
me so here we go we're here again
I Rose to speak out against HB 231 and
we're here again discussing the
prosecutorial overthrow Bill SB 92. and
I cannot for the life of me understand
why we have other elected officials
other constitutional officials in this
state if all we're going to do is
continue to tell them how to do their
job
one of the things that I hate as a
business owner and most of you in here
are business owners is micromanagers
you know those people that get in the
way of you during your job because you
believe your way is the only way
but I present to you that we have become
a hundred and eighty Micro Managers for
the 49 DA's in the state of Georgia
I don't understand this so this is what
I propose a legislative qualifications
Commission
and this commission shall have the power
to discipline remove and cause
involuntary retirement of legislators
just like this bill does
but we're duly elected officials you say
so are the DA's and the solicitor
Generals in this bill
but sometimes you say you decide not to
sign on to a bill because that's within
your discretion right
same is the case for DA's that have
certain fact patterns that you don't
have
but you say we have the ethics
commission but they can't remove us like
the several entities we already have to
remove DA's and solicitor generals and
we all know at least a few legislators
that can benefit from some chastisement
or removal
so who's going to sign on to my
legislative qualifications commission's
Bill anybody who's supporting this bill
all that SB 92 is doing is killing a fly
with a bazooka because you have a few
DA's and you want to get them out of
office
there are so many more already existing
ways to get rid of them
but instead of using what we already
have in our toolkit we make another
unnecessary expensive and arbitrary law
So to that end I don't ever want to hear
the following buzzwords from the
supporters of this bill number one
small government
this bill creates more layers of
government at a price tag that is going
to be at least one million dollars so I
don't ever want to hear about small
government
two local control
this is legislative control of the
locals a textbook example so that's a
word I don't ever want to hear again and
third Criminal Justice Reform the only
reform that is going on is telling DA's
and solicitor generals how to do their
job regardless of the facts of the case
so I leave you with this
our only legislative responsibility is
to pass the budget that's it not to pass
unnecessary laws so I urge each and
every one of you to consider voting no
to SB 92. thank you Mr Speaker
the lady has yielded the well
representing Stacy Evans is recognized
to speak to the bill
speaker and hello again colleagues
we heard that this is going to be the
fifth time that we voted on this bill
which means that at least five times
this bill has had changes just on this
side and I'm sure there's been more
because
I know what it's like to be in a
Judiciary Committee and things change
and changed again and changed again so
who knows how many times
and I bring that up because maybe
there's a reason
this doesn't make it all the way across
maybe there's a reason five times I
can't think of anything
and I'm not saying there's not but I was
trying to think this morning has there
ever been anything that I've voted on
five times
I can't I can't think of anything y'all
will come to my desk and tell me later
if I'm forgetting something but maybe
there's a reason
one of those reasons is that this is
probably not a priority for very many of
you
I I'm I'm certain that's true we've
heard stories so far I think of three
DA's that folks seem to have problems
with
one
the D.A that mishandled to say the least
the Ahmad Aubry decision
gone
thank you voters
the situation I believe somewhere in
Middle West Georgia
removed
delayed only because RDA I mean our uh
attorney general didn't stand in the
power he had to do something about it
sooner the governor stepped in got that
taken care of so that leaves one that
we've heard about in Athens
that D.A I'm not going to talk about
that individual situation that's not my
business for a number of reasons
but that dla was elected in 2020.
we're standing here in almost April of
2023.
it's a non-partisan elected official
that means that person is up for
election in May of 2024.
a little over a year from now
how about we let the voters decide
even under this bill
the first time somebody can file a
complaint against somebody is October
2024.
so the voters can deal with it before
this commission can
but let's talk a little bit about the
mechanics of what changed because I know
I've been up here before this session
second time about this bill counting
other other sessions so you've heard
from me a lot on this
one of the changes is that now the
appointments for the members of this
commission instead of being made by the
members of the Georgia Supreme Court
which is what we had in our version that
passed out of here now
the individual members are all going to
be appointed by partisan elected
officials The Usual Suspects Governor
lieutenant governor Speaker of the House
but there's one category that stood out
to me I hadn't seen it before
and I thought it was interesting that
we are going to advocate for that in
this house some of the appointments are
going to be made by the senate committee
on assignments
so Governor got it
Big Man on Campus lieutenant governor
speaker those kind of balance out each
other with the chambers
but then the Senate
committee on assignments get some extra
appointments so I'm I disagree that we
should step in and try to over cdas but
I really don't understand why this house
would tip the members of this Commission
in favor of those across the hall and I
also don't understand why we decided to
change it from the Georgia Supreme Court
making the appointments
that's a significant change
the jqc which a lot of folks have
mentioned
trying to draw parallels with this build
the judicial qualifications Commission
has appointments by Governor lieutenant
governor speaker but also some by the
Georgia Supreme Court this commission
will have none by the Georgia Supreme
Court I think that's interesting while
we're on the subject of judicial
qualifications committee for those that
have said why can't we just have a
commission for the prosecuting attorneys
when we have them for the judges in
addition to all these things that I'm
hearing about folks say that are
overlooking prosecutors
why do we have a Judicial qualifications
commission why can't the State Bar just
handle the judge's misconduct too
because not all judges are attorneys
about 40 percent of the judges that
serve in this state are not attorneys
which means the State Bar cannot oversee
them so we have to have a Judicial
qualifications commission if you are a
prosecuting attorney a D.A or solicitor
you have to be a lawyer which means you
have oversight from the State Bar in
addition to all the other things and I
know that's repetitive but we don't seem
to be getting it because people keep
coming up here still and saying this is
just like the jqc no it's not
the other thing that's different in this
bill from the version that we passed out
is that
uh the decisions of the hearing panel
the the hearing panel will make a
decision they'll be investigated
there'll be a hearing panel decision and
then there's the potential for an appeal
instead of that appeal going through the
Supreme Court which is what our version
in the house
um had in it now we're going to set up
an appeals process that goes through
County superior court systems
but they're different depending on who's
doing the appeal which I find curious
if you are the D.A or the solicitor that
is appealing a decision you go to the
County Superior Court where you're
elected
but if it's the claimant I suppose the
person that was complaining about you
that makes an appeal or I guess the
commission could appeal you go to the
Fulton County Superior Court no other
place
that seems interesting to me why you
would have different paths for that
and then one of the other big changes
and I've alluded to this a little bit
already but this version allows
complaints to be filed as early as
October of this year so I misspoke
I misspoke first mistake I have ever
made from this well I'm sure
um I said October 1st 2024 was the first
time you could make a complaint under
this bill but it's actually October of
this year
um still the D.A that folks seem to be
concerned about in Athens is going to be
up for election in May of 2024 so it's
not much longer but the version that we
passed out of this house
had the first complaint not being able
to be made until April of next year
I those that drafted this version might
also want to think about
the smartness that's not really the
right word the
I'm confused as to how we can have a
version that says all the rules for the
commission must be established by
October 1 and we're also going to start
dealing with complaints on October 1.
that that seems to be a problem and
probably something that happens when you
change things and vote on it five times
again maybe there's a reason
that this hasn't passed out
so I want to recap
what we're setting up here this little
business will be repetitive and I
apologize but
this is a big deal y'all we're stepping
all over elected officials
first we are going to say that every
prosecuting attorney must review every
individual case
now let's put aside
how are you going to know that how are
we possibly going to police whether a
prosecuting attorney has looked at every
individual case
putting that aside
we're saying in this bill that every
decision not to charge or to charge
can't be the basis for a complaint
unless
there's bias or conflicts or quote
factors that are completely unrelated to
the duties of prosecution
it's another drafting question what is
the difference between completely
unrelated versus related
that's a question but what does that
mean now the last time I was up here to
talk to you about this bill we talked
about the situation of little Johnny
that got in trouble
had a little too much to drink or was
found with a bag of something in his
glove box that he shouldn't have and Mom
and Dad called the prosecuting attorney
and said
useful in discretion can we put them on
probation or can we put them in a
diversion program or can we just let
this one slide we talked about Uncle Bob
who got in trouble again we made the
call now I'm not suggesting that any of
those things are right believe me I
cannot stand the back scratching that
leads to some people getting treated
differently under the law than others so
I'm not here defending that system but
what I'm telling you I know as well as
you do that that happens it happens
every single day in every Community
across this state now those decisions
that are made because so and so went to
school with somebody or yes that was a
useful indiscretion and we don't want to
we don't want to sideline this young
lady or this young man's life for a
youthful indiscretion so we're gonna put
that in the drawer that's gonna happen
and now every single time it happens
we're setting that person up to be
removed that prosecutor we're setting
them up to be removed from office that
does not seem like a good use
of money
but prosecutorial discretion goes
further than that
and again prosecutors prosecutorial
discretion either have it or you don't
you have it or you don't that means
every single decision we heard this
morning from the well about how
solicitors are not
Prosecuting the crimes of
the things you're not allowed to do when
you're homeless tents and blankets and
things like that on the sidewalk they're
not Prosecuting that
now when they don't
they're going to be called up for
removal
that hardly seems like a good use of our
time and our funds
and this commission and our elected DA's
when we all know that there are bigger
problems and apparently we're doing all
of this
for what I've heard is one person
because you all know we're not allowed
to pass a bill to actually just affect
one person so we have to do this bigger
so we have to create all of these
investigation panels for all these folks
that are probably doing what the
community wants we heard that from some
speakers in the well this morning have
we heard from the citizens I would bet a
lot of money
that the citizens do not want their
solicitors
Prosecuting the homeless for their tents
or their blankets or starting a fire or
whatever happens
they would rather them go after the
rapes than the murders and the art and
the armed robberies
so those DA's those prosecutors are
doing what the citizens want but now
we're going to call them in front of a
commission
probably made up of no one from their
community
to ask them questions about it
I don't think
that that is a very good use of our time
so what do the citizens want
well since we've now voted on this four
times it's about to be five times they
voted on it over there we've gone
through
I think this is the third year that
we've talked about this bill maybe at
least two
and for the most part
folks have gotten themselves back into
this off back into this chamber the
governor got reelected
the Attorney General got reelected I
don't think anyone's that worried that
we haven't created the prosecutorial
oversight commission and I think we
would be well to
finally put this thing to bed vote it
down and let's move on to things that
citizens actually want us to focus on
and not one person thank you Mr Speaker
I yield the well
lady has yielded the well
that completes the Minority Report
all right sorry we have another one that
signed up did you want to come back
representative Kendrick
will have the remaining three minutes
and 20 seconds
of The Minority Report thank you
so I'm back and I wanted to point your
attention to lines 212 through 218 of
the bill words matter we all know that
words matter you don't have to be a
lawyer to know that words matter
and it talks about how do you make a
complaint and it talks about the
complainant now the interesting thing
about this build is it has a definition
section but you will notice that it does
not define who the complainant is
so I can file a complaint in Meriwether
County somebody
in Alabama can make a complaint against
a D.A in Gwinnett County I guess
technically somebody outside of the
country could make a complaint against a
local D.A because complainant is not
defined in this statute this bill needs
a lot of work y'all it's going to have
so many unattended consequences and if
you think the bill is only going to be
one million dollars think again because
if you have an unlimited supply of
complainants that can complain and file
complaints this bill is going to balloon
so if you care about fiscal
responsibility I urge you to vote no
against this bill but for it it for the
very fact that this bill does not say
the words that it needs to say in order
to narrow it down to make it fiscally
responsible and to make sure that we're
not spending unneeded funds on people
who can just make things anywhere
so how many more minutes do I have Mr
Speaker
one minute and 45 seconds okay so I'm
gonna read this line to this
is all of my 20 minutes for my Minority
Report so line two
two starts and says in any complaint
file with the commission alleging a
violation of subsection 8 H and
requesting an investigation of an
elected or or appointed district
attorney or solicitor general the
complainant shall be required to file
with the commission of sworn affidavit
detailing the personal knowledge of the
facts which personal knowledge is not
defined as well supporting the complaint
including any interest the complainant
may have in the outcome of the case the
complainant May attach documents to
support the complaint and nothing is
cold session shall be construed to limit
the ability of the commission to bring a
complaint pursuant to this cold session
on its own motions
ladies and gentlemen
as my colleague said before I got up
here we have so many other priorities
within this state
trying to tell other elected officials
how to do their job should not be one of
them
so I look forward to filing some
legislative oversight commission since
we want people to be able to remove
other elected duly elected people from
office I look forward to seeing many of
you
um follow the conscious of your
solicitor general your attorney general
and the people that elected you knowing
that they have the good sense to elect
who they want to elect in office and to
make sure that we are focusing on the
things that the state of Georgia wants
us to focus on and I have what 30 more
seconds Mr Speaker your time has expired
okay thank you Mr Speaker
the ladies time expired and she yielded
the well good call
now we're here from the chairman of the
committee from which this legislation
passed through
chairman title Tyler Paul Smith
recognized for your comments
thank you thank you Mr Speaker Mr
Speaker I yield the balance of the
Chairman's time to Vice chairman Matt
Reeves
representative Reeves is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and chairman Smith
I'm proud to speak in favor of house
bill or Senate Bill 92 the prosecuting
attorney's oversight Council I'd like to
applaud representative Joseph gullet and
vice chairman Houston Gaines for giving
this bill a thorough presentation and
hearing uh both in the house and the
Senate this bill has been perfected it's
ready to be enacted as a lawyer and as
somebody who sat through a lot of those
hearings in the house Judiciary
non-civil Committee I wanted to speak to
a few points that may not have been
brought out yet in favor of this bill
one there was one argument that the
State Bar of Georgia ought to handle
district attorney and and solicitor
oversight well the State Bar of Georgia
regulates all 50 or 60 000 lawyers in
Georgia there are only 50 District
Attorneys uh they're perhaps a smaller
number of full-time solicitors and the
State Bar is not equipped they don't
have a department or an investigative
set up to investigate prosecutorial
oversight they are handling Bar
complaints on a generalized basis and
they just uh did not sign up to
investigate and hold accountable
prosecutors so there's not really a
viable option you've got to have a very
flagrant situation for the State Bar to
have any effect secondly in the
committee someone found that we still
have a law on the books on impeachment
of District Attorneys and prosecutors
and I I don't want to ask for a show of
hands but I would imagine not too many
people want to have a a special session
or take up precious legislative days and
hold impeachment of prosecutors here in
this body that did happen that happened
in the 1960s I believe was the the last
time there is a very close and
appropriate analogy and this bill tracks
that and that's the judicial qual
qualifications commission there is a
Georgia independent agency which is
funded by the state and it is uh well
equipped and specialized to investigate
judges who've engaged in wrongdoing
sufficient to have them removed from
office the jqc has has done a great job
of making sure we have a Judiciary
that's impartial and has integrity and
that is the analogy in a lot of ways for
this bill Senate Bill 92 having
integrity and prosecution is important
Georgia has a history of that in the
Years following Watergate it was
Georgians who went and cleaned up the
department of justice under judge
Griffin Bell as attorney general when
there was a single digit uh confidence
in the federal department of justice and
Georgians cleaned that up with the kind
of Integrity that we appreciate we don't
want to have a weaponized prosecution we
don't have a want to have a partisan
prosecution we want to have a
professional and independent prosecution
that's effective in enforcing our laws
Georgia Georgia has a neighbor to the
South Florida the third largest state in
the nation and the way they handled a
situation down there recently shows one
alternative that I believe this bill is
better than in Florida the governor is
empowered to remove a prosecutor who
chooses on a blanket basis to decline to
prosecute certain laws that the Florida
General Assembly he passes and that's
what the governor down there did and the
court affirmed that removal of a
prosecutor who on a blanket basis
ignored the laws of the Florida house
and the Florida Senate that's the stakes
here no one likes judicial activism but
on the other hand we don't want to have
prosecutorial activism and prosecutorial
veto of the laws that the people send us
here to make here in the House and
Senate signed by the governor so
while a case-by-case basis of
prosecutorial discretion is appropriate
if Little Johnny has a bag of weed or is
drunk driving and they're mitigating
circumstances that's one thing but for a
prosecutor to say I have too much crime
I'm going to quit Prosecuting all theft
cases that's how we have a uh epidemic
of car break-ins and theft and God
forbid uh personal
um uh victimization of people so
um this is a good bill it's been
thoroughly vetted
elections every four years the toll that
that takes on Georgia is a massive
caseload I've got colleagues here in the
house for Macon leader Beverly
representative Paris representative
Washburn I remember when I was in
college at Mercer district attorney
Weston retired now judge Sims became
district attorney and uh former district
attorney Weston drove to Americas to
clean out a massive backlog that had
accumulated over time that took a long
long time and a lot of money from that
county that small County to clear out a
caseload that accumulated in the
meantime there was uh crime uh
proliferation that was a result of that
we've heard in committee from Columbus
West Georgia Glenn County
the former district attorney from Banks
County having serious problems that it
takes too long to remove a D.A under
current law so what this law does is it
makes sure that if a D.A is not
operating their office in the interests
of justice that we have an independent
professional body who could remove them
for the benefit of the people and the
safety of our neighborhoods thank you
for supporting Senate bill 92.

arise

the record saying that solicitor general
Keith Gammage is one of the best
solicitors in the state of Georgia and
that all solicitors should look at him
as a role model and he definitely would
not be a part of any kind of
Investigation because he is such a role
model to other solicitor Generals in the
state of Georgia is that not true
I'm sure the lady believes in is on the
record
for what purpose is representing remind
rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true that when I asked a
question about House Bill 505 and
whether or not it could potentially
prosecute folks that got too excited

we should trust prosecutorial discretion
I'm sure the lady has a great memory and

calendar at this time
we have some family members in the
gallery we're going to go ahead and take
up
SB 107
sb107 so I need your attention
as we move forward with SB 107 Mr clerk
will you read the caption
107 by Senator Burns to the 23rd and
others to be entitled an act to a man
Title 31 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to health assist to
enact Izzy's law to provide the
Department of Public Health shall
develop and make available for download
from its internet website a model
aquatic safety plan based on National
standards for private swim instructors
as Bill Evan refer to the Committee on
Public Health that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by rules
committee substitute
thank you Mr Clerk
chair recognizes representative Hilton
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I Rise
to present to you Senate Bill 107 which
aims to protect Georgians who are
receiving private swim instruction uh by
requiring an aquatic safety plan uh the
background of the bill stems from an
incident in June 2023 when a
four-year-old boy Israel Scott uh
nickname Izzy tragically drowned while
taking private swim lessons in Burke
County I know I've got some speakers
after me but I want to recognize the
family who has joined us in the gallery
there if they would stand up uh so we
can recognize them
[Applause]
Izzy's family has worked incredibly hard
since that time to to advocate for this
legislation which essentially says if
you're delivering private swim
instruction here in the state you've got
to be able to provide a model plan which
recommends a recommended ratio of
students to swim instructors a
recommendation for secondary supervision
provides for participation by a parent
and requires certification uh for CPR by
the instructor themselves Izzy's law
here in Georgia will heighten awareness
of safety needs create a reasonable
model with an aquatic safety plan and
protects Georgians who choose to
pursue private swim instruction and so
with that I will yield for questions Mr
Speaker
you have no questions that I yield the
well and ask for favorable consideration
thank you
represent representative gladney
is recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
good afternoon colleagues
I Rise before you this afternoon
to speak in support of SB 107
as I speak to you this afternoon
I will share with you a story
a story about a family
represented in the Augusta delegation
so what started as a beautiful warm
summer Day
mid-june last year
while all of us who are seated here
today
were most likely doing very diligent
work advocating for our communities
supporting our families and being good
neighbors
making sure we were putting our best
efforts into representing the folks that
sent us here to occupy these seats today
there was a mom in Burke County
getting her busy day started as well
Miss Dory Scott
Was preparing to take her son her
four-year-old son Israel
whose nickname is Izzy
for his second swim lesson
prior to the start of the lessons based
upon her resources and her means as a
local hair stylist
mom did her due diligence
she checked around the area for
reputable reputable instructors to make
sure her baby boy was prepared for the
summer
so that he could play and swim safely
with the others
Izzy's older siblings had even learned
to swim with the same instructor
so Mom felt he would be an entrusted
care
meanwhile doing their ride in the car
to the group swim lesson in the
neighborhood close to their home
on this fateful day Izzy who was
normally a vibrant exuberant child who
absolutely loves superhero Black Panther
and dinosaurs and playing with his older
brothers and sisters
he has a moment of pause
and he is slightly hesitant about going
to the lesson that day
and says to his mother
what if I drown
and she does exactly what we do as
mothers do
she Comforts him
and she assures him
that it will be okay
because she knows that she will be
waiting for him in the car
when the lesson is over
and she waits
and she waits
but unfortunately
the rest of the circumstances
surrounding the events of that day are
very unclear
and held the worst news of their lives
for Dory Scott and her family
there are a Litany of news articles and
stories that offer many varying views of
the chaos that unfolded
and out of complete respect for the
family I will not revisit those details
but what I will say is this the reason
why I stand before you today is because
Izzy is no longer with us
you see ladies and gentlemen this is his
obituary
he wasn't able
the latest release
of his favorite
superhero series
he didn't get a chance to spend his
fifth birthday
surrounded by his family and his friends
who loved him
as a matter of fact he didn't make it
out of the lesson that day to his
mother's car
he drowned
that day
and the Dreadful reality
is that is not an uncommon circumstance
according to the CDC in this country
there are over 4 000 fatal unintentional
drownings involving children every year
averaging 11 drownings a day
our entire Community was heartbroken for
this family
and the tragedy that broke our entire
community
everybody knew somebody that was
connected to this family in some way
how could something like this happen at
a swim lesson
the family wanted answers
the community wanted answers
imagine Dory Scott's desperate pursuit
to find answers for her son Izzy
turning into a law because what she
ultimately discovers is there is no real
standardized measures for accredited
swim instructors which brings us to our
discussion today and an opportunity
today to protect Children and Families
through some measures in Izzy's law
Izzy's law makes Provisions through a
number of components which include
requirements for the Department of
Public Health to develop widely
accessible safety plans for aquatic
activities based on standards of
nationally National Partnerships with
recognized authorities such as the
American cross
YWCA in the National drowning provincial
Alliance and others it enacts
requirements for a CPR certification by
swim instructors or an assistant
additionally Izzy's law raises the
standard of responsibility for those who
provide private aquatic lessons and
heightens awareness for the public
so in closing I'd like to leave you with
two thoughts about why I support this
bill
number one because it speaks to all the
reasons why we lift our voice in
advocacy for those who cannot be here to
represent themselves
number two because it is a good bill
it has Provisions that protects other
families like the Scots from this awful
fate of ever having this experience
again
my continued prayers are with the Scott
family as a mother of three adult sons I
am profoundly sorry for your
unimaginable loss
I respect the sacrifice you have made to
carry this torch and I am honored and
grateful for the opportunity to support
your family in this effort to my
colleagues
I request your favorable consideration
for SB 107
Izzy's law
Mr Speaker I yield the well sir
the lady has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here's
none the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to adopting The
Substitute offered by the committee on
rules
the chair here's none the rules
committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair hears none report of the committee
is agreed to shall this bill now pass
all in favor of the passage of the bill
will vote Yes all those opposed will
vote no and the clerk will unlock the
machine
for what purpose does
chairman Prince rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker is it not true
that it was the hard work of Senator Max
Burns and our own house member states
state representative Gloria Frazier who
brought this to our attention and their
hard work is what we see as a result of
force
the chairman knows of what he speaks
for what purpose does representative
sharp arise parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry is not true that I've been in
the medical field for over 30 years and
I think this is a great Bill to have
and if so I would like to make sure that
any instructor or any facility also is
required to have an AED
which will also be something that they
can use easily that would help in
situations like this
I'm sure the gentleman with his training
knows exactly of what he speaks
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
169 the Nays zero the bill hadn't
received a requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
to Senator Burns and all the delegation
representative Frazier and the entire
Richmond delegation thank you for your
work to the family
our hearts go go out to you what a
beautiful young man he was his memory
will be less will last in your family
and in this state for years and years to
come as easy law as a part of who we are
thank you all for being here we
appreciate y'all so much and safe
travels home
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
Senate Bill 145 145. Senate Bill 145 by
Senator still the 48th and others to be
entitled an act to amend chapter 60 of
title 36 the official quoted George
anitator relating to General professions
applicable counties and Municipal
corporations so it's prohibit local
regulations that create differing
standards for or distinguish
gasoline-powered leaf blowers from
similar equipment this bill then
referred to the committee on
governmental Affairs that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
this bill has several speakers
so I will ask all members
I will ask ask all members to give the
member in the well your attention
chair recognizes representative gullet
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
presenting you Senate Bill 145
this is a bill that has incorporated
several Provisions from other bills
um first it incorporates
House Bill 374 which was voted out of
this house
related to Municipal de annexations
this bill also establishes the landscape
equipment and agricultural fairness Leaf
Act
which provides Statewide parity for
gasoline leaf blowers with battery
powered and other such devices used in
landscape construction and Pest Control
Bill also includes a a measure from
representative Roberts
that has the cities and counties that
the cities and counties ask for related
to cleanup from House Bill 1405 from
last year because it swept certain
administrative permits into it so all
interested parties have supported this
this uh this minor cleanup
it also part four corporates
commercial property assessed
conservation energy and resiliency
development authorities
a part five provides for all types of
law I'm sorry all types of energy or
fuel to be delivered for the for the use
of appliances
in part six allows for additional
investment in EMC owned gas marketers
um it does a lot most of these again
we've passed out of this body already
things got held up in the Senate
um so I'm happy to answer to me uh
answering any questions Mr Speaker I
know the hour is getting late and
there's there's some speakers to it
well you almost had no questions but you
do
huh representative Higley to your left
has a question representative hugley is
recognized thank you Mr Speaker that's
the gentleman yield I do
how do all these various things come
together under one bill how how are they
all germane uh you got several different
subject matters going here so help me
out on how all this goes together yeah I
think they're all within the government
Affairs uh committee is the one who
brought all these bills together from
the germanness I think the committee
voted and believed those to be germane
and so it was all in the title section
same title section legitimate further
yeah I'll yield again so is it my
understanding that the committee voted
on all of these various bills separately
but not as a yeah this bill was brought
together into one bill and voted out of
committee
thank you yes sir um yes ma'am uh Mr
Speaker I know the hour is late again
there's several speakers and I'm gonna
go ahead and yield the well
[Music]
General Zeo to the well we have some
speakers on the bill uh Rick I recognize
representative nullowitz speak to the
bill
thank you Mr Speaker
friends
arise before you today
not to speak against two-thirds of the
components of this bill I really just
have a problem with one-third of the
bill two of the parts
I have the utmost respect for my
colleagues who worked relentlessly to
perfect HB 374 indeed I voted for that
measure when it was before us on the
house floor earlier this session
I fully support C Pace I agree this is
great language
I offer my full-throated support for my
colleagues language that would clean up
legislation that passed last year
I am delighted that language from HB 92
legislation that I co-sponsored actually
found a home post crossover day
I only regret that it is included in
this particular bill which along with
the four sections that I support
includes these two other Provisions that
are with sincere apologies to Samuel
Taylor Coleridge
are an albatross hanging from the necks
of these otherwise worthy bills
I first rise to speak against the
original language of SB 145
it is no secret that I am no fan of
local preemption bills but the ones that
really stick in my craw are the local
preemption bills that are entirely
unnecessary
when I initially read SB 145
the phrase that is now in lines 115
through 117 of the bill that we have
before us today caught my attention
it reads
the general assembly finds that prudent
legislation I'm sorry The Prudent
regulation of gas-powered leaf blowers
is crucial to the welfare of Georgia's
economy
again the general assembly finds that
prudent regulation of gas-powered leaf
blowers is crucial to the welfare of
Georgia's economy
strange thing to say about leaf blowers
I thought when I first read this
not even the truck weight spill has
language like that and how we move
Freight and Georgia is arguably probably
more crucial to the welfare of our
economy than gas-powered leaf blowers
that odd scrap of language though
sparked something in me
sparked a memory it took me on a walk
down memory lane and now I ask you all
to join me
with apologies to Sophia Petrillo
picture it this house floor 2015.
out on the ropes a brilliant and
gorgeous young city council member
fervently Works to convince the esteemed
members of this body that they should
vote against another
eerily similar to this bill local
preemption bill this bill SB 139
declared in lines 13 through 15. the
general assembly finds that The Prudent
regulation of auxiliary containers is
crucial to the welfare of Georgia's
economy
right
if you weren't here in 2015 you may not
know that auxiliary container is a fancy
way of saying plastic bags
sb-139 was the plastic bag band
if you want to continue this stroll down
memory lane with me
you can pull SB 139 up and compare it to
SB 145 and when you do you will see what
I realized earlier this session which is
that SB 145 is a line by line copy
a line by line copy of the plastic bag
band
it is as if whoever wrote this bill
treated SB 139 from 2015 as if it were a
legislative Mad Lib do you all remember
Mad Libs
it's as if it was a Mad Lib replacing
the phrase auxiliary containers with gas
powered leaf blowers wherever the former
phrase appeared
now the plastic bag band ultimately met
its demise here on this floor
and it died on this floor because the
majority of the lawmakers here recognize
that their personal feelings about
plastic bags aside
it was a genuinely banal thing over
which local control should be eroded
in fact one house representative noted
in 2015 that he would not want his own
City to plus a ban on plastic bags
he wanted and if you were here you'll
remember his pickles and ice cream to be
secure in their auxiliary plastic
container
but this member who voted against this
bill continued and this is a quote but I
don't have the same issues as Tybee
Island I don't have the same issues as
Athens in his City My City has its own
unique set of issues if we pass this
bill we are taking a tool out of the
toolbox for those local governments to
deal with their own problems
what did Tybee Island and Athens have to
do with plastic bag bands you may ask I
will tell you those are two cities that
actually did have conversations and
proposed ordinances about banning
plastic bags in their Community prior to
the introduction of that local
preemption bill in Tybee Island it was
in the name of fiscal responsibility as
keeping the city's beaches clean is
actually an indisputably I would say
crucial to the welfare of their economy
and the city was spending tens of
thousands of taxpayer dollars every year
to keep those beaches free of plastic
bags
other than Tybee the only other
municipality in Georgia only other than
Tybee only one other municipality in
Georgia was considering a plastic bag
ban and to date only one city in Georgia
has tried to enact such a band and how
they're enforcing it
it really remains to be seen
and I repeat
no City at all has tried to regulate
leaf blowers no city or county in
Georgia has tried to do anything to
regulate the use of gas powered leaf
blowers the ones that are so crucial to
our economy other than maybe addressing
it through a noise ordinance saying what
time of day you can use them because
nobody no I mean nobody even the leaf
blower manufacturers want them used
outside their kitchen window or their
bedroom window at seven or six o'clock
in the morning
I believe the takeaway from SB 139 in
2015 is that there is no reason no
reason
to deny cities and counties the ability
to individually determine for themselves
whether or not they want to regulate
plastic bags or gas powered leaf blowers
or gas stoves a local preemption related
to Gas Appliances I suppose with
apologies to Hank Hill this would also
include propane and propane accessories
that's the other part of this version of
SB 145 that I find concerning this bill
was originally HB 438 unlike
several other provisions of this bill
438 never made it to the floor for a
vote SB 145 was with apologies to
Princess Leia it's only hope
as with gas powered leaf blowers no city
or county no city or county nowhere
nowhere in Georgia has entertained the
notion of limiting or prohibiting any
gas Appliance I personally love my gas
stove
supporters of this measure remind us
that states like California and cities
like Seattle have passed or proposed
similar preemptions admittedly those
states are a little bit greener than we
are
they may even be a little more woo-woo
than we are
here in Georgia
but they also have something out west
that we don't and that something is
earthquakes
are you familiar with the Cascadia
subduction zone
I know tell me your dad is a
petrophysicist without telling me your
dad is a Petro physicist am I right my
seventh grade science fair project was
actually about plate tectonics and I
know that the science faculty at Dory
Intermediate School in Spring Texas is
delighted that I am speaking to this
issue today
the Cascadia subduction zone is a 1 000
kilometer fault line that stretches from
Vancouver Island in Canada down through
Washington State and Oregon ending near
Mendocino California
the scientists who study these things
are certain that this fault line is not
only capable of producing earthquakes
greater than 9.0 on the Richter Scale
they also agree that the next big one
that'll probably be you know potentially
9.0 on the Richter scale is about 75
years or so overdue and there is indeed
a 37 percent chance that this big one
this big earthquake that is going to
cause like a massive tsunami
and a lot of Destruction and will be
second only an estimation to the 2010
Haiti earthquake it's coming it's
overdue it's going to happen and the 37
chance gonna happen in the next 50 years
what does this have to do with gas
stoves I'm getting there I promise one
of my sisters beloved sisters I have you
might hear me mention my sisters often
from this well because there are
actually four of them so it may seem
like I just have one sister who does a
lot of different things but I actually
have four
Seattle doesn't actually have a ban on
gas stoves her house was built in 1941
when they renovated a few years ago they
made sure everything was electric they
have electric heat electric hot water
everything is electric
even though they could choose gas but
the reason they have electric is not
because there's any local preemption
it's because after that earthquake
happens
she and her husband feel like their time
would be better spent digging their kids
out of the rubble than trying to find
the gas shut off valve so their house
doesn't explode after the earthquake
I don't know if comparing cities like
Berkeley California or elsewhere out
west to any city in Georgia is in any
way apropos
again no city in Georgia is considering
any kind of a ban no county is
considering any kind of a ban or any
kind of limitations on the use of gas
stoves I don't think any city in Georgia
to be quite honest looks to Berkeley
California for model ordinances
I mentioned earlier that I love my gas
stove and do you know who else loves
their gas stoves
the many incredible chefs and restaurant
owners that operate their restaurants
throughout the state of Georgia
I am confident that if any city in
Georgia were to entertain such an
ordinance
the many many James Beard nominated an
award-winning chefs
in Atlanta Decatur Savannah Athens and
Cobb County all of these amazing
nationally renowned and recognized chefs
and restaurateurs alongside restaurants
that range from National chains to Mom
and Pops they would all have something
to say to their city councils and county
commissions on this issue and I would
encourage them to say that because again
I love my gas stove
so why even go there
why do we continue to see such an urgent
commitment of time and energy to
ensuring that local governments in
Georgia continue to not do something
they already have shown no interest in
doing no city or county wants to
regulate gas powered leaf blowers no
city or county is trying to take away
your gas stove
it's just not a thing it is not
necessary for us to have these bills
so I was thinking about this this
morning thinking about what I was going
to say if this bill made it to the floor
today
and one of the things I realized is that
these preemptions for gas powered leaf
blowers
are a little bit like a snipe hunt
you know that old sitcom trip
okay if you're a boomer or Gen X you
probably remember the episode of Cheers
were Sam norm and Cliff they took
Frazier on a snipe hunt
that was a banger man it's a good
episode if you're a whippersnapper
you've probably watched Atlanta and in
season four of Atlanta
Ern and Van take Lottie on a snipe hunt
it's an old sitcom trope
seen it a thousand times a thousand ways
the thing about a snipe Hunt is that you
send someone on a quest to find
something that they will never find
and that's a little bit what like these
preemptions are
they are special interest groups mad
living legislation in an attempt to send
the general assembly on a quest to keep
cities and counties from outlawing
something that no one is even trying to
outlaw
it is a waste of our time it is a snipe
hunt it is a legislative snipe hunt
in a few minutes we will have the
opportunity to vote our conscience on
this Christmas tree Bill the size of
which is worthy of that rotunda right
Beyond those doors and when that time
comes I urge you to ask yourself
if good policy should include these
continued erosions of local control in
Georgia I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
representing Rahman is recognized as
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues good afternoon
um you're probably wondering why I'm
talking about leaf blowers today I'm
wondering why we're talking about leaf
blowers today
I think this is like the 5 000th Bill
we've read about a local rule preemption
and I don't really know why today seems
to be local preemption day but here we
are
so for those of you that haven't read
this massive bill yet that's about
36 pages long we have quite a few
Provisions in this one
and per usual I am here to talk about
your unintended consequences within this
bill
if anybody is surprised uh you must be
new here
um
so unfortunately with this bill SB 145
it is attempting to put our thumb on the
scale within the free market and y'all
have heard me say this before
picture for a second it's Sunday morning
and by some miracle nobody in your house
has woken you up yet whether that's your
dog your spouse kids if you got them
see it's almost this quiet right and
you're finally sleeping in for the first
time ever
and you hear
um
right outside of your window door house
whatever the case may be
and it's a very very loud leaf blower
whether it's in your apartment here in
Atlanta in your home
doesn't matter
and you're just mad because that was the
one day you were going to be able to
sleep in and now you can't
and you go talk to your city council
person and they say yeah that was just
part of our typical Landscaping that we
do for the area
and you go
why do you have to use the loudest
option possible on a Sunday morning
now
I don't know about you
but I've actually heard electric leaf
blowers and they are much much quieter
there's actually a reason why
if you go to a Home Depot now you'll see
a lot more electric leaf blowers than
you will gas leaf blowers
you wanna know how I know that because
my husband decided to become a
landscaper recently but that's beside
the point
um
so
I have to wonder
why are we so obsessed with gas leaf
blowers
is there like a big Pro gas leaf blower
movement that I'm not aware of
someone please let me know if there is
because I have not heard of it until
today
so as I mentioned now I go to my city
council person and I say man I was
almost able to sleep in the other day
and I couldn't because this annoying
leaf blower was going off and I want you
to ban leaf blowers particularly the
very loud gas ones
and you know if we pass this bill with
the city council person is going to say
you're my State Rep I can't do anything
about it but you can
and I don't know about you but I don't
want to get involved in Municipal
related issues that's why I'm a State
Rep
and not a city council person granted I
didn't want to run for office to begin
with but that's a different story
and
it has been a long day
so again I ask you why are we so
obsessed with gas leaf blowers and why
is it in this bill
and while we're at it why is everything
else in this bill in here why do we
continue to preempt local control on
every little piece that relates to the
well-being of that community and what
that Community Knows Best
and this isn't even something that'll
make the community better
I mean look with all due respect if you
want to smell the exhaust of a gas leaf
blower by all means more power to you I
don't so please don't make me smell the
gas of a leaf blower it really is that
simple and I'm not trying to be like
comical actually I'm very intentional
trying to be comical here because
I don't understand why this keeps
happening in this body
if for example I live in a community and
we all prefer electric related utilities
or in this case you know stoves or
whatever it is why can't we decide on
electric stoves believe it or not with
some pots and pans it actually works
better
did you know that I just found that out
recently
so in all seriousness
this bill is the amendment and
amalgamation of a lot of other bills
what we're basically saying is that a
lot of local governments and potentially
public universities
are effectively prohibited from choosing
their energy source
and again I don't understand why
if a university wants to save costs and
they find out electric is cheaper
shouldn't they be able to do that
don't we want our public universities to
cost us less money
didn't we just talk earlier about how we
can't afford that extra five percent for
whatever reason
but now we're saying oh we can afford
more money to prop up an industry that
frankly
is becoming less relevant because we're
finding better technology
and that's okay
if an industry wants to compete in the
market and I hear this all the time when
we say we want to protect consumers we
want to do this we should let the market
figure it out okay let the market figure
it out on this one
why are we insisting that we need to put
a thumb our thumb on that scale and in
particular a scale that frankly smells
very bad
I don't like the smell of gas exhaust
there's also a lot of questions
um that have come up as a result of this
bill at least in my mind
if cities have energy benchmarking
programs is this bill going to now stall
those programs or even prohibit them
completely
what about if a city is trying to run
some electric lines or gas lines or
whatever the case may be and they find
oh there's actually something in the way
maybe gas doesn't make more as much
sense maybe you should try electricity
are we going to now prevent a city from
doing that and instead force them to run
a gas line like three times as long
I know these seem like really silly
questions and things that you and I
don't have to deal with because we're
not the ones sitting in those planning
meetings but I promise you there will
now be people who have to pinch pennies
and cut costs and potentially put more
people at risk because we decided you
know what this is how we want
municipalities to function
we don't all live in the same kinds of
housing we don't all live in the same
kinds of towns we don't all live in the
same kinds of cities each one has
relatively unique infrastructure
particularly related to when that town
or city was established
I know in one of my cities there's been
a lot of amazing Innovation on
electricity and electric related
resources
it I think this bill is going to hinder
that and frankly I think Georgia is
going to be worse off
because that city has done an incredible
job of finding solutions for problems
that we have been talking about for a
long time
whether that's Transportation whether
that's utilities whether that's
accessibility you name it
frankly I geek out every time I go visit
that City
so now I have to explain to them why
some of their programs might now be
halted which by the way those programs
bring in jobs
so now we're risking potential jobs with
this bill
I know I made a joke earlier but why are
we even doing this
because at the end of the day
as we continue to do this related to
whatever pet issue we come up with that
day our cities are going to become more
and more hindered to address the
problems that we then fault them for and
then we turn around and wonder why our
cities are not doing more to help with
whatever issue we're dealing with
here's the other piece that's really
important
for more than five years Georgia has
been a leader in clean energy jobs but
this is a blatant attempt to stop that
it's like we keep moving one step
forward and three steps back
those things are exciting we've got kids
right now in schools who are preparing
for those jobs
and now you're telling me by the time
they graduate those jobs might not be
there anymore
what's the point
if every time something Innovative
happens something exciting happens we
recruit kids for that pipeline in our
public universities and then they
graduate and find out oh actually this
body passed a law that job isn't there
anymore
why do we do that
it's gas y'all
literally this is what we're talking
about here it is gas
I mean seriously
it's okay for people to pick other
sources of energy to heat up their homes
to cook their food
to power their cities
that is totally okay to do and when we
preempt them from doing that
frankly the negative consequence is far
outweigh whatever this bill is trying to
do now
I think it's also important to
understand that Georgia has no
significant methane reserves to frac or
drill this means that as a result of
this bill we're going to end up losing
more money out of the state in order to
be able to give people the gas they're
going to be asking for
I don't know about you but I would much
rather spend my money here in Georgia I
really like the state
um
and to be honest with you the sad
reality of the situation is that this
bill is not unique to our state this
kind of legislation has been spreading
all around our country
and it is making it incredibly difficult
to move forward as Society
because that's what this is about
we've found ways to heat our homes
for in much cleaner ways we've found
ways to cook our food in much safer ways
we found ways to
Drive our cars
without as many emissions as we as we
used to have and I don't know about you
but I want to breathe easier
there's nothing I hate more than going
on a run
and having to inhale all that exhaust
from the cars around me
and when I go to a park and all the leaf
blowers and lawn mowers are going off
and suddenly I have to smell that gas
too
so I can't get away from the smell of
exhaust on the roads obviously can't get
away from it on the parks because now my
municipality can no longer mandate that
their contractors have electric leaf
blowers and electric lawn mowers which
by the way were great
we have them I was going to bring one
today to show you all but I didn't
realize this bill was coming so
but
at the end of the day
I really sincerely hope that no matter
what you've heard about this bill that
you will reconsider
because I promise you there's going to
come a day where one of your city
council members is going to come to you
and say we got this awesome Grant or we
have this opportunity for a great
project and you're going to have to tell
them sorry I voted on this bill a couple
years ago and it's not going to let you
actually do that because you're
preempting because you know you're
trying to prevent gas leaf blowers or
whatever you're trying to do
how is that fair
here's the here's the other piece of it
you know like I said we have talked a
lot about various preemption bills in
this body
and I've kind of talked a little bit
about jobs a little bit about the
uniqueness of each town or city
but I sincerely hope that as you vote
for this bill whatever talking points
you've heard about this bill please
consider your cities and towns instead
because there are so many opportunities
and grant opportunities out there right
now to make our cities and towns better
and so I strongly urge you to vote no on
this bill I yield the well thank you Mr
Speaker
the lady has yielded dwell
representing Brad Thomas is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker so today arise to
speak out in support of this bill sb145
and I want to talk a little bit about
some of the the energy that we've
discussed during this session one of
them being electric vehicles
um I don't know if many of you remember
but I stood up here in the well in
support of the electric vehicle bill and
I did so for one reason because I
believe in energy choice
and that means electric that means
gasoline that means whatever form of
fuel hydrogen whatever form of fuel that
you want I'm okay with that and we
should be doing things that support that
this bill does that
and
when it comes to Lawn Service
specifically because that seems to be
one of the number one things I hear a
lot about down here in the well today on
this bill
um
what you hear about the the electric
leaf blowers and the issue with electric
leaf blowers they just don't have the
power that a gasoline leaf blower has
that that technology has not gotten to
where it needs to be to be competitive
in a free market economy and that's what
we want
that's what this bill does it makes sure
that the free market is available for
those small business people that are
blowing and taking care of our Lawns and
and golf courses or whatever else that
that we choose it may be schools
so that they they can go and buy
equipment that they can afford and don't
have unnecessary burdens put on them to
buy equipment that quite frankly doesn't
work as well
it requires a substantial amount of
infrastructure that they have to
purchase to even be able to use that
type of equipment let's be honest the
battery doesn't is not going to last all
day but you can fill up a gas tank
fairly quickly
so with that being said again I I
implore all of you here let's think
about the mom and pop let's think about
the the dad or in the the small business
owner that is just trying to do the best
they can to survive and let's let the
free market rule thank you Mr Speaker
you're the wolf
representative Roberts is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I know
my position may not be popular this bill
has a lot of things in it it does but my
understanding is every single one of
them passed out of a committee they've
just kind of been all compiled in this
included in that is um some cleanup
language that accg GMA
um several jurisdictions around the
state asked me to bring to my bill from
last session which was HB 140 1405.
and it kind of swept up some
administrative permits that we did not
mean to sweep up into the definition of
quasi-judicial and it was going to
create complications which the whole
point of the bill was to minimize
complications and reduce complications
so I'm grateful that this part has been
incorporated into this bill
um
I also believe in local control
I try to look at each one individually
and I'm going to give a different
perspective on the leap blower
I have a landscaper Rigo
he works with his brother his wife they
do everything legally they have a
five-year work visa they work harder
than any person I've ever seen
and I've got to believe that this bill
was brought because there was some
threat to
gas lease blowers and right now there's
no product on the market that's
comparable that he could do his job and
so I would love for the industry to I I
did vote for the sunset Amendment but it
didn't pass because I'd like to force
the industry to come up with something
that would be cleaner and would be
comparable but right now it doesn't
exist and I just can't vote against this
because of my guy Rigo thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well
lady has yielded well
representative Victor Anderson is
recognized to speak to the bill
he is our last speaker on the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'll be very brief
I just want to point out one thing about
both the gas leaf blower provision and
the gas Appliance what we're all calling
those two items in this bill there's
nothing in either of those bills that
prevents a local governing Authority
from implementing Energy Efficiency or
environmental programs that are
incentive based what it does is it
prevents them from
penalizing lack of participation in
those programs we're not saying that you
can't have programs we're not saying you
can't promote those types of energy
choices but we we are saying that you
can't mandate them and penalize the lack
of participation thank you Mr Speaker
that completes the questions the
gentleman yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered chair here's none
the previous question is ordered we do
have a Minority Report representative
Jasmine Clark is recognized to
bring the Minority Report members
need your attention
please give the lady in your will your
attention
representative Clarks recognized
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues there
arise to ask you to vote no on SB 145
um
I think we've already discussed kind of
the Ridiculousness of having to debate
leaf blowers
um I want to point out that today
um in another state babies
were killed
by bullets
and we have not debated a single
bill when it comes to protecting babies
from being killed by bullets but today
we're talking about leaf blowers
I think that's an important context
so you know
right right now I'm sure there are
plenty of you who can relate to the
story that was told in the well about
the early morning leaf blowers and the
truth is they are loud
they are very very loud and especially
when you're tired and you are hoping to
get a little extra bit of sleep let's
say the day after signing die you're
tired because we've been here all day
and then your neighbor decides hey you
know I feel like uh blowing some leaves
at 7am
right now
your cities and your local governments
could restrict hours when you could have
such loud noises
but arguably this bill could preclude
that
that's an issue
because no one likes to find out that
the reason why their city can't do
something about a nuisance is because
the state is is stopping them or
prohibiting them from being able to do
that
also I just want to point out how this
bill is truly an attack on clean energy
initiatives
and it's very curious to me
because
we see where the industry is moving and
it seems like someone outside in the
hall
has decided we've got to protect gas at
all costs
there's no reason to do this because
right now we already because of a bill
that we passed before prohibit our
governments from adopting policies
um that
um prohibited Things based on their
source of fuel
but now we're going to go further and
say not only can you not prohibit it you
can't even restrict it so what does that
mean what's the difference between
prohibiting and restricting
now we're saying you know what you can't
not only can you not say you can't have
this Appliance now we don't even want
you incentivizing using one thing over
another which could be considered a
restriction
we do not want you saying that we are
going to build more affordable houses
that are all or Total Electric
or that utilize solar power because we
don't want to make the gas industry mad
so let's zoom out for a bit and let's
talk about affordable housing because
I've talked to a number of people in
here on both sides of the aisle and they
say they truly do care about addressing
our affordable housing crisis
I've actually seen a couple of other
preemption bills they didn't get a vote
but they definitely got some signatures
from people right here in this chamber
from frankly both sides of the aisle
that would have told governments that
what color they cannot restrict based on
color they cannot restrict based on you
know building materials all these
different things because they said they
claim they care about affordable housing
but now we have a bill that says that
you cannot favor
building materials or appliances
that are going to be more affordable and
allow for a building of more affordable
houses it is actually cheaper it is less
expensive to build with Total Electric
the data bears that out
not just that as we said as I said we
are moving toward using things like
solar and that's amazing you know why
because here in in Georgia we've got
solar plants coming up we got battery
plants we are actually in Georgia moving
in the direction of innovation
Economic Development and Innovation is
happening right here in our state
we are trying to lead the way in these
things and then you slap a bill like
this on our desk and say absolutely not
you must uh at least uh or you cannot
say that you can't use gas or you can't
even restrict it it's not even just
about a prohibiting it's about
restricting as well
so
what if these cities want to incentivize
Energy Efficiency would they be breaking
the law
what if cities want to incentivize
Builders coming in and building more
affordable housing by using Total
Electric are they breaking the law is
that what we want to do here
and at the end of the day
I know there are several people
on the opposite side of the aisle then I
that talk a lot about small government
when they're talking to their
constituents
small government this small government
that there is nothing small government
about this bill in fact there's nothing
small about this bill we've added all
types of crap to this bill since it was
first drafted this bill got bigger and
bigger and bigger and with it government
got bigger and bigger and bigger and
we're going to vote for that
it's interesting to me because most of
the people outside of here would claim
that it's the Democrats
that are all about big government it's
the Democrats that want to control your
lives it's the Democrats that want to
preempt local control
it's not us
this bill bears that out
it is not us that is that is
introducing these re preemptive bills it
is not us
so ask yourself
and I'll make sure
that you know uh speeches like this get
posted so people know exactly who is for
small government and who is not for
small government
because I think we think what we do in
here stays in here and that's not the
way it's supposed to work we're doing
the work of the people and so the people
deserve to know who's voting in their
best interest and who is not and so I am
going to yield the well by asking you
all to vote no on this government
overreach for once we've already had
plenty of preemptive bills maybe this
one we can finally say this is the final
straw this is the straw that broke the
camel's back
vote no on this bill vote Yes on local
control and let our local governments do
what the people elected them to do thank
you Mr Speaker I yo the well
the lady has yielded the well
now we'll have the Chairman's time up to
20 minutes
there's a lot of the Chairman's time
I'll recognize
chairman lahood to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I do not believe I'll need 20 minutes
for this
I just wanted to clear the air on a
couple things and then let everybody
vote
so this bill does have a lot of parts to
it there are several bills that got
added to the original uh gas leaf blower
bill
and let me just clarify on the leaf
blowers
the bill does not
uh
do anything to protect gas leaf blowers
that it doesn't do for electric leaf
blowers all it does is required that
local government
any any ordinance or law that they
create for one type of blower goes for
the other type
you know you could uh
you can get a goat to climb a tree but
you're better off to hire a squirrel in
other words
your landscape provider
if he can do a better job with a gas
leaf blower than he can with an electric
let him do his job
and if you want to hire a landscape crew
that uses all electric then do that it's
up to you nobody's telling you that you
can't use the the leaf blower of your
choice
the bill just says that the the local
government cannot treat one type of
blower different than the other
the other parts of this bill have all
been thoroughly vetted through committee
several of the parts have passed through
this house already
and um
we've got biparton support bipartisan
support
for every
part of this bill now I know there's
there's concerns on both sides for some
parts but there's bipartisan
bipartisan support at some level for
every part of the bill so as for your
favorable consideration and uh Mr
Speaker if there's any questions I'll
take one or two
gentleman has a question or two
to your left representative Oliver has a
question way to your left right Mr
Speaker I Rise to make a motion
right now we're in the posture of a
question I'll be glad to entertain your
Motion in a moment thank you sir
my year ought to represent Bentley on
the left and the back has a question
ladies recognized
thank you Mr Speaker there's a gentleman
yield sure friendly question and I'm
just really trying to understand this
debate because what I first learned of
this uh this bill last year
it was on I was on an impression that
this legislation and I'm going to use
for an example
is it not true that I was on an
impression that this bill what helps Mr
Ernest that works with me at the funeral
home Mr Ernest is a small business owner
and he cut grass in Taylor County and
also cut grass in Peach County and the
majority of his customers are
elderly women that's living on a fixed
income and so he's a very small business
owner
and so is it not true that I was just I
was on an expression that this bill will
make it where Taylor County couldn't put
an ordinance in place that mandated Mr
Ernest to have only one type of blower
and Peach County would have something
totally different which would make it a
little difficult for Mr Ernest to be
able to really operate his very small
business in the manner he needed to
trying to serve older individuals on a
fixed income
so I believe what you're saying is this
bill would provide stability and
consistency to people who provide the
service of landscaping and that would
might require the use of a leaf blower
so you are correct you know what you
speak okay that helps me thank you sure
gentlemen yield for another question uh
one more Mr Speaker
representative let's see chairman Alan
Powell to your right in the rear is
recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker will the gentleman
yield yes sir
as I look through this bill and I was on
governmental Affairs but is it not true
that each of the sections of this bill
have already cleared the house Committee
in various forms you are correct is it
also not true
that when we talk about in a lot of the
discussion here has been about
preemption but is it not true that the
local government's Representatives with
ACC gym and GMA either they were far or
neutral on all of these positions you
are correct again
if I might further yield if you may
further yield
so then looking at all of these sections
and I continue to hear a lot of the
discussion I know that a lot of the
members are tired and a lot of things
have been said is it not true that this
is a customary way of passing
legislation because every member of this
house that puts in a bill is going to
try to the very end to be dedicated to
try to pass his or her bill
that is correct uh this our governmental
Affairs committee that you are a member
of
um I believe is one of the busier
committees in this house and Heard lots
of bills this year and some we just uh
some just ran out of time
so yes
if the gentleman will further yield yes
sir then is it not true that this is a
customary way we just didn't invent it
with uh house Senate Bill 145 but these
bills that are commonly referred to as
Christmas trees or a variety of
different names that have a lot of
different subject matters this is a
customary way of trying to get things
across to the other house to try to get
it either to a conference committee or
to get it to pass so that each member's
legislation they worked on will have a
chance to pass and for the benefit of
the for the state
you've served in this house a long time
and you know what you speak one further
question if you'll yield all right one
more one of the questions that I've
heard back here was something about
plastic bags is it true there's nothing
in this bill about prohibiting plastic
bags that is absolutely true thank you
gentlemen thank you Mr Speaker I'll
yield the will gentleman has yielded the
well
for for what purpose does representative
Oliver rise Mr Speaker I Rise to make a
motion stage of motion
I move that pursuant to article 3
section 5 paragraph three of the state
constitution of Georgia that Senate Bill
145 Provisions be declared not germane
with one another in support of this
motion Mr Speaker I will suggest that
the Appellate Court of Georgia wall
versus Board of Education say that the
provisions of any bill must have a quote
Unity of purpose and secondly under
loot's V Forum that the provisions must
be logical have a logical and natural
connection Mr Speaker in making your
ruling please tell me how leaf blowers
see space annexation have a Unity of
purpose
would the representative I understand
the very learned attorney and research
constitutionally would you state that a
little more clearly for me
loots this is versus Forum says that
provisions of A bill must have a logical
and natural connection and wall versus
Board of Elections state that the
provisions of Bill must have a Unity of
purpose
in quoting the constitution of Georgia
it is clear that under article 3 section
5 paragraph three of the Constitution
Provisions must be declared to be the
germane with one another
so I'm I think I can rule on the
germanus I'm not sure about the
constitutionality you have to take that
up across the street over there with
some of those folks but here's what I'll
tell you
two parts of this we've debated it
thoroughly
these issues in included in this bill
were debated in committee
by the committee members
and they've they've done their jobs
they were it was voted out of the
committee
and I want every member of this house to
have opportunity
to render their decision
so I respect the gentlelady but I'm
going to rule that this this issue is
Jermaine all of these issues are
Jermaine and this house will take a vote
on on this Senate bill 145.
yes ma'am you may have one follow-up is
recognized what does leaf blower and sea
space have as a Unity of purpose
I appreciate your question I think your
question has been asked and answered
this bill is Jermaine the issues of this
Germain and we're going to take a vote
on it
is there any objection to the committee
substitute the chair hears none the
committee substitute is adopted is there
any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill the chair has
done the report of the committee is
agreed to shall this bill now pass all
in favor of the pests of the bill we'll
vote Yes all those opposed will vote no
and the clerk will unlock the machine
you gotta
for what purpose does representative
Smith rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the
state you inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it
true from years ago I served here in the
early 90s and I heard the statement
danger zone
these last few days we're in
they're going to be a lot of things
coming through we did debate this one
pretty good but
a lot of bills hooked up on other bills
and isn't it true that we need to be
extra careful to make sure we are
talking same subject matter and same
coach section just totally in it true
must be totally my opinion
the gentleman's opinion is respected and
certainly every member
has a right to their opinion for what
purpose does represent main arise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
isn't it true that this is a lot of
bills and I am going to vote Yes for
this bill because one part of the bill
in particular is very important to
constituents that have been reaching out
to me
I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks
I'm taking one more and that will be uh
for what purposes represent Townsend
rise
Parliament inquiry Mr Speaker inquiry
is it not true that the Coastal Georgia
after a hurricane uses gas blowers to
clean up the mess and the debris
sure the gentleman knows of what he
speaks
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine

103 the Nays 67 the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed now we have
