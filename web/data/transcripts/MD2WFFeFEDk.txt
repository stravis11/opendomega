If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. I hope everyone had a great weekend. Ready to go to work. We've got a busy week coming up. We're going to begin our day to day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chapel. And after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chapel in this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 15th House District Representative Matthew Gamble. Representative Gamble. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It is an honor to be able to introduce to you today my friend, a apostle Eric Mosley. Pastor Mosley is the lead pastor of all about Jesus Ministries in Carter'sville, Georgia. He attended Floyd College, now Georgia Highlands and Rome, Georgia. Prior to going into ministry, he traveled with people like Tyler Perry and Todd Bridges, performing in stage plays. It was while he was on the road that the Lord called him back home to lead the Floyd College choir. The choir eventually changed its name to all about Jesus choir and its members were from many different Christian denominational backgrounds. In 2003, the choir transitioned into all about Jesus Ministries. In this year, they will celebrate their 19th anniversary of ministry. A native of Somerville, Pastor Mosley is the son of minister Melvin and Betty Mosley. He is the devoted husband to Pastor Medea Mosley and the father to Erickson, Josiah, and Hanna. Pastor Mosley is dedicated to bringing the body of Christ together across denominational, political, and racial lines. He is also an entrepreneur and is the owner and caterer of a barbecue business, bones and gristles. And today he's come to feed our souls. Pastor Mosley. Thank you, uh, Rep Gamble. And one of our slogans in my barbecue business is if your grandma may not have no tea, she can sip them through a straw. They're that tender. I just want to talk to you today just for a few minutes and then we'll pray. The word that was on my heart just to give you guys is Matthew 18 and 19. It's that again, I say unto you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my father in heaven. And that word agree in the Greek is the word symphonale. And it is where we get the word symphony from. And so, you know, as you guys embark on doing your thing, making laws and everything, trying to remember it's all about agreement. It's about making a symphony. And one thing about a symphony when you make good music, you got a drummer and you got a keyboardist. Though they're doing different things, they still all play in the same key in order to produce symphony. And so, you know, I want you to meditate on that thought, you know, because you may be in different tribes, you may be on different sides. Realize the goal is to produce symphony because that is how the rules are going to be made. That is how things are going to get done. Amen. So, remember that about agreement. Symphonic. Make beautiful music together, love on another. Laugh. So, let's pray at this time. I can't go on to stand and bow your heads. Have any father. We enter into your gates this morning with thanksgiving and into your courts with praise. We bless your holy name as we come before you in the courtrooms of heaven. We repent for our unrighteousness and wicked ways, those we know and we don't know. Lord, we pour down and we pluck up every demonic root that would hinder and pervert judgment through your leaders, that you have chosen. For your word says in Romans 13, verse 1, let every soul be subject unto the higher power. For there is no power but of God, for the powers that be ordained of God. Let your leaders understand that they were chosen by you from the foundations of time. Lord, call your leaders to fear and desire your wisdom and understanding daily. For you said in Joel 28, verse 28, and to the man you said behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. And to depart from evil, that is understanding. Lord, you said you would give us wisdom if we would only ask without doubting. So, Lord, I declare your wisdom, counsel and understanding would be their portion. For you said that by these, according to Proverbs 8, verse 15 and 16, kings reign and rulers decide and decree justice, princess rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth, govern rightly. Now, Lord, I pray for their families that you would grant them grace to battle Lord of husband, wife, father, mother and children. Lord, I ask that you would keep them and their families safe just as you have said in 3rd John 1, verse 2, be loved. I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health just as your soul, prosperous. Heavenly Father, I ask that you would reveal yourself to your leaders. Lord, I declare that agreement and unity would be manifest among them, according to 1 Corinthians 1, verse 10. Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you would speak the same thing and there be no division among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same man and in the same judgment. Heavenly Father, I pray that when these, your leaders are finished, Lord, let it be said that they value them worship your purpose and not their position. For the position produces pride and control, but the purpose produces responsibility and responsibility will produce the fruit of righteousness, integrity, in their words and in their actions and in their life. Lord, as we end the prayer, we remember the bill of President Eisenhower passed and described in God, we trust our currency. Reminded of Proverbs 3, verse 5 through 7, trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not until your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path. Do not be wise in your own eyes, feel the Lord and depart from evil in Jesus' name we pray. Amen and amen. Our pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, individual with liberty and justice for all. Doorkypers, unlock the doors. Doorkypers, unlock the doors. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

time the dean of the Georgia House of Representatives Dean Smiley I tell you what my first day back but what a day to get to come up here and when the speaker told me on Friday that he was going to have the mayor of Atlanta I told him that was awesome and I had told the mayor that I couldn't wait for him to get over here and he said but one other thing I want to tell you he said I'm going to let him come down to center aisle I want to tell you he's been a big time only time I've seen that and it was one of the few times I've seen it happen in his house it was when well none of y'all were here but we had I want to mention but you wasn't here but a few were here I feel we're here I think the green and the pal maybe one or two others but Ray Charles was one of the first people that I have seen come down to center aisle before that I had never seen that and I I think we all being dead it to give our speaker around the applause for allowing out there to come down that loud he said he might have to sing but we're not going to sing because he doesn't have a piano he the mayor can't sing without a piano so looking down on the already but but you know I I've known on red dick is mayor dick is for a long time and I should have this with him privately but but in his inauguration speech I know he has the he has the intellect he has the capacity and he has compassion to be a great mayor those ingredients I think would be a great mayor but one ingredient he said and I told him a story about my personal life when he said I'm going to be me I'm not going to be anybody else I'm going to be me when I heard him say that in an inauguration it reminded me the story that if you be you and not somebody else then your pathway will be there so I'm just happy to say hello and do say I'm excited for his leadership and the being the leader of the of the economic engine of our great state Atlanta and I'm just thrilled today that the 61st mayor is here to say hello to members of this all of us a body so Mr. Speaker thank you for allowing me to have this opportunity word and again welcome I knew how Williams had to say so he can't have it but welcome to the 61st mayor and and he's it is a great opportunity and and we welcome him with open arms so thank you Mr. Speaker Thank you thank you very much Dean Smiley it's a real honor to introduce to you today a leader who has only been in his current role for about three weeks but I think he's made already quite an impression on this capital city Andre Dickens serve two terms on the Atlanta City Council and outside of public life has been known by numerous titles businessmen non-profit executive engineer and decon

But if I had to guess and I haven't asked him this, I would think, would say that his favorite role is that a proud father to his daughter. He is a native son of Atlanta, the product of Atlanta Public Schools, and a graduate of Mays High School. He went on to obtain, he's got a character flaw here. It will kind of get over this in a hurry. He went on to obtain his bachelor's degree from where? Georgia T.E.C.H. Georgia Tech and a master's degree from Georgia State University. I want to share a little personal observation with you about him. Over the last few months he's been in to see me and we've chatted and we've seen each other at different events and had some opportunity to talk. But he made an impression on me on the morning after his election, the runoff election. It was about 7.30 in the morning. I had just finished getting ready to leave the apartment. My phone goes off and it's Andre Dickens. I said, why in the world are you calling me? You should be headed toward a vacation or something. He had a million things to do. He had just won an election the night before and I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for the other candidate either. We chatted and he said because I want to know how much I want to work with the House of Representatives to move this state and this city forward. That meant a lot to me and I appreciate you doing that. I figure we're going to disagree on politics or policies from time to time. But I think that we're going to be civil and respectful and I'm just honored that he is here with us today. So I hope you'll join with me in giving a warm welcome to the 61st Mayor of Atlanta, Mayor Andre Dickens. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just stand here and I look around and I try to take it all in. I just try to take it all in. This is a very, very special place. You might have been here 40 times or 80 times or a thousand times but this is my first time standing right here in my whole life. I stood up there and I've watched you work and I've observed you with humility and honor and respect for what you do. And today God has blessed me to stand here in a very special place at a very special time. It's a Cairo's moment. A moment that is just unique and special in the person's life. I don't take this moment for granted so as I'm speaking I'm still taking it all in. I'm breathing in this awesome responsibility that you have and being very careful with the one that I've been given. I'm the Mayor of Atlanta now and I'm grateful and I want to have the best relationship with this body that you could ever have with the mayor. That's from the sincere bottom of my heart. That's my goal. I'm from Georgia. I'm from Atlanta. You heard it Atlanta Public Schools. I'm from right here, right around here. So everything you do matters to me. So to my dear friend, Speaker Raustin, to the Speaker Pro Temp, Jones, to Majority Leader Burns, to Minority Leader Beverly, to Dean Smirre, our ambassador on his way, to members of the Atlanta delegation that I meet with and speak with so often and to all of the members of this August body. I thank you and I greet you this morning on behalf of all of the citizens of Atlanta. I'm happy to join you today and bring you greetings as I said from our capital city. I want you to know how much Atlanta appreciates you and the work that you do on behalf of the people of this state. I had an opportunity to sit down last week with the media in Atlanta and I outlined for them my administration's big bucket priorities. I realize how much of what we do will be enhanced by a strong relationship with each of you. We share a common goal to keep this state and its cities moving forward. I will remind you of what some of you may have heard from me at the eggs and issues breakfast. This city plays a critical role in our, in driving our state's economy and we take that role very seriously in Atlanta. That makes it all the more imperative that you help us maintain this position by recognizing that as a city we are stronger together. One city, one city with one bright future. One city with one bright future. What is good for Atlanta is good for Georgia. This is the message that we send to our business partners and to all of the people of our city. We remain in the throes of this public health crisis, the global pandemic. I want us to continue to work together through this, to do everything we can to help our communities emerge intact after this very difficult period. The sooner we do, the sooner we get on with the business to making Atlanta and the state of Georgia whole again. I've said this before, there are only about 400 steps between the state capital and city hall. I walked it again today. You know that I don't mind coming across the street to engage with each of you. Since the election, I've been over here three to four times. I think this is my four time in just a couple of weeks, a few weeks already. I see this relationship as valuable and I have 400 steps in me anytime you should need me. My invitation remains open to you to do the same, to come over to city hall. We got nice things over there, friendly people. Come see us, come talk to us. Collaboration will make us stronger. You may have heard me mention this and it's become a guiding principle for me and it's a tagline at this point is that I draw circles. I don't draw lines to divide. I draw circles. I want to bring us all together. I don't draw lines. I just sincerely disagree with the notion of that division is a key way to move forward. What that means is that I am committed to an inclusive approach to leadership, not one that will divide us and I'm excited about the circles that we have already had the ability to draw together. As mentioned, this is my third week. This is my 21st day. So when years I'm legal. I'm legal. You know, when you're 21 you're legal to do some things. And so I find myself legally able to stand right here in this body and to talk to you today. I have hit the ground running. I've come through my adolescent years real quick in these first three weeks. I've got my seat legs under me. I've already announced the opening of a precinct in Buckhead. We're already starting on the way of hitting that 250 officers that we're recruiting to the Atlanta Police Department. We're already on our way. I've been to every single police zone and gone to those role calls to look those men and women in the eye and tell them they have my full support as we go out here to do the good work of providing safety and justice in Atlanta. We had snow that I was ready for. I talked to a gentleman from Bartow County. They had real snow. But I was ready if the snow was coming down down. We had salt trucks. We had sand, gravel. We were ready to make sure that you could go to work and that the people of Atlanta could go to work and the kids could go to school. I'm a hell of an engineer from Georgia Tech. I'm going to make sure that we keep things going in Atlanta. You see I saved that for last. In case he kicked me out, I could get everything else in. I wanted to say. We also had vaccination events. To now, in my first couple of weeks, we did major events on vaccinating our employees. And now we're at 73% of our 8,500 employees have been vaccinated and boosted. We gave him $100 to do so, but I think it was well worth it. We're going to make sure that we fight it on that end. And I've had a good number of conversations with the leaders of our homeless support community. I know you see it as you've come into our city and some of you have encampments in your cities. Don't test this, Scott Atlanta. Look at us as some people, as a community that's trying to help some people get to where they need to be. And I'm going to be committed to that because it's a moral obligation for me. As mentioned, I was a deacon. I'm looking out for the least, the last, and the laws. And we just getting started on that. We're going to help. We're going to help. And it's not just because it's around here, it's because they need a place to be, to get them into a sustainable life that they can live in dignity. So we're working on that. And lastly, we had a great, I called a summit on the role of leadership and these nonprofits on raising up young men of color in our city and making sure that they go on the right path and have great opportunities. We did that last Thursday and we're putting our arms around them so that they can have great opportunities so that they don't do some of the things that we would not want them to do, but we'll do the things that in life that they should be doing. And so we've already just begun. Like I said, I just turned 21 today. I'm legal. I already got through my adolescent years. Let's go as we go on to the future together. I look forward to working with you. And thank you for having me this morning. God bless each and every last one of you. Thank you. Thank you for having me. This is awesome. I really appreciate it. Thank you. All right. House will continue to be in order. We're going on to the local calendar. Third reading and passage of uncontested local bills. What purpose does representative Williamson rise?

House Bill 897 by Representative Stevens, 164th Brian County. What purpose does Chairman Darlene Taylor rise? To make a motion. State's a motion. I'd like to have House Bill 872 and 873 remove from inter-governal coordination to governmental affairs. Both Chairman agree. Chair, it does not recognize Chairman Taylor for her motion at this time. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on the local calendar? Without House Bill 881 and House Bill 890? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bills? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall these bills now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bills on the local calendar will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of the bills on the local calendar without House Bill 881 and House Bill 890. The eyes are 153. The nays are zero. These bills having received the requisite constitutional majority are therefore passed. What purpose does Chairman Tancersley rise? Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a motion. State your motion. I'd like to move that we immediately transmit the local calendar to the Senate. Chairman Tancersley has moved that the local calendar be immediately transmitted to the other legislative chamber. Is there objection? Is there objection that Chair hears none and it is so ordered? Chair now recognizes Chairman Darlene Taylor for a motion. I move that we move House Bill 872 and House Bill 873 from Intergovernmental Coordination to Governmental Affairs and both Chairman Agree. Chairman Taylor has moved that House Bill 872 and 873 be recommitted to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Is there objection? There is objection. Does the lady move? Does the lady move? The lady moves. All those in favor of the lady's motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does Representative Park rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State Chair inquiry. Is it not true that moving House Bill 872 and 873 would be a violation of rule 18.3 as any local legislation that comes out or sent to the House floor would come out as structured and cannot be further amended. And so thereby moving both bills to Governmental Affairs would have the effect of killing both bills. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? Well, I have a lot of confidence, the utmost confidence in Chairman Tankersley as well as Chairman Taylor. And I don't know any of the details beyond that. So I'll leave it at that. The majority caucus will represent to Wilkerson rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State Chair inquiry. Is it not true that in 2011 296 bills pass this Chamber's local legislation dealing with redistricting? And if we move these bills to Governmental Affairs, we are in essence killing all local legislation the concept of it in this body. And every local bill from here fourth should be voted on separately as a bill. Is that? No matter of debate and we have a procedural vote before the body. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of or on the motion to move House bill 872 and 873 to the Governmental Affairs Committee. The eyes are 91, the days are 69, and the motion has been adopted. What purpose does the representative park rise? Motion reconsider Mr. Speaker. Thank you serve notice today of your intent to seek reconsideration tomorrow. Is that right Mr. Court? Through the Chair's answer is that because it is a procedural matter that it wouldn't be subject to reconsideration, so your motion to be out of order. We're going on now to morning orders. Going on to morning orders. All members of the House to please take your seats. All members of this House will please take your seats and give attention to the members in the well. If you can't do that then we've got two any rooms in a hallway to room adjourn to. Chair recognizes for a morning order the Dean of the House, Dean Smirre. We're going to limit morning orders. We've got a lot of them today, so I'm going to limit them to one minute each. I thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I just wanted to come and for a minute to say thank you from the round tree, Mitchell and Smirre families on the loss of my daughter. One of the first calls I had on Christmas Eve was from Speaker Rauston and I was so thrilled to hear from him and hear from so many of you. I want to thank the minority caucus and the Democratic caucus and the Speaker's office. They were just absolutely his staff. We take for granted but what they do in the time of all of our bereavement, his office staff from the Spirit Road and the Catholic. All the members of that office, they are exemplary when it comes to all of us and doing that time. I want to ask them thank my delegation. I y'all put your arms around me and embrace me doing that difficult time. The longest drive and many times I've had drive to Atlanta, the longest drive I've ever had was Christmas Eve and going to the Emirates Central's Apospital. But I'm strong. I have a lot of faith and the Lord will see me through it. But I could not let another day go by and say my first day back, I want to say thank you from my family, from the bottom of my hearts. We said lightly that we are family but we truly are and I just got so, I just can't tell you the outpouring. It was just phenomenal and that's the only thing that healed me up and lifted me up during this difficult time. So again, Mr. Speaker, thank you for your friendship and your support during this difficult time and to all of you all in this house. I can say to your friends and family and from the bottom of my heart, from all of our families, I say thank you. I speak out here the well. I recognize his chairman Oliver for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise with my colleagues to honor the life and memory of Jeffrey Allen Parker who died Friday evening of Martin Luther King weekend, ten days ago. He was 55 years old. He survived by loving family, his parents, his brother, his wife of 32 years and his young adult daughters Gabriel and Isabella. He was very blessed with a loving family. His daughters talked about his joking, his bad jokes, his attentiveness to them, and every single event, every single sporting activity. They knew that he loved them. For those of us in this building, we will miss him very painfully. He was the ultimate professional, his expertise, his judgment, and his passion.

his national leadership on transit. He had a 35-year career beginning with an internship in college. He had served in the private sector. He had run other multi-modal transit entities across the East Coast. He had served with Marta before his appointment in March 2018. We're at a pivotal time in transit funding in Georgia. We trusted him. He was the consummate professional, and we will miss him. His family has chosen to recognize that his death was a result of suicide. His daughters want us to know that they can never know the reason for this terrible act, but that suicide is preventable and mental health services are available. We'll be talking more this week about mental health. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You as well. Chair recognizes representative Maynard for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. There is a lot of pain in the world, a lot of mental illness, fear, instability, depression, anger, and misguided thoughts. If you have lost someone to suicide or know someone who has lost a loved one to suicide, please join or stand by me. I lost my little brother in 2010. It took me a very long time to just answer that he was gone. People would ask me what happened, and I couldn't get the words out. After a few months, when I was able to speak, I mumbled he had a heart condition. We told a family and friends it was a heart condition, but it was not, it was suicide. He was 21 years old. Most suicides occur in the holidays after the holidays in January and February, like adults, children die every day from suicide as well. Suicide is the leading cause of death in Georgia. Suicide can be preventable as Chairman Oliver said. For suicide survivors that may be watching, the ones that lost a loved one in this horrible act be strong and most importantly, do not blame yourself or think you could have prevented this death, the National Suicide Hotline is 1-800-273-TALK. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Wade for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. I'd like to ask you to stand with me to celebrate the life of a friend of mine's mother. Many of you may know this amazing magnificent woman's daughter Valerie Wilson, Valerie in our former school board members and we are peers and friends. And I'm warm with her, but I celebrate the life of her mother who is an educator, a first grade and third grade. She was a teacher in a manual elementary school. And she lived a magnificently kind and impactful life for her community. So if you'll join me with a moment of silence to reference this wonderful human being. Thank you, Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Anola Witts for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am here because January is cervical cancer awareness month. On your desk, I have shared information with you about cervical cancer in the United States and in Georgia. Tragically, 140 people die of cervical cancer every year. And here's the thing. This is a cancer that is almost entirely preventable with a vaccine. The HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer and several other kinds of cancer. Throat cancer, oral cancer, rectal cancer. It is a cancer vaccine. It is a miracle. And I want to make sure you know that on your desk, you have this information about cervical cancer in the United States and in Georgia and in how entirely preventable and how many lives we can save by sharing the knowledge of the HPV vaccine. Thank you so much. Chair recognizes representative Holly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Actually, before I speak, I'd like to actually thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's particularly hard to come and speak on someone that you miss. You've been able to do that twice already. So I appreciate now being able to address this. I'd like to, for all of you to please stand and recognize a friend of mine who I missed very dearly. Peter Taylor is long been an active citizen and making bib counting. For 53 years, he served in the labor unions first work with the communication workers union. And later on as a international association and machinist and aerospace workers member and served ever so much in the community, he was the president of Georgia Central Labor Union. He was actively involved with the local WAC chapter and especially with the Democratic Party there. I met him back in 2016 working the area during the presidential campaign and always known to be very friendly, very supportive. He believed, he really believed in people. He was so compassionate. He leaves behind his wife, his sons, Mr. Carolyn Taylor, we love you. And I just want you to know that unfortunately, he was gunned down in his home as a retiree, seven years old, and the bullet came straight through his window and hit him two days after Christmas. He succumbed on to 29th. But I'm very thankful to the crime stoppers making bib region for doing their part to making sure that they can catch. They can bring the person to justice. I just want to just, I'm reminded in this moment, my good brother, Joshua, 19, which says, just to be strong, to be of courage because Lord goes with you wherever you may go. He asks us this time, please. Let's revere him in a moment of silence. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a real quick before I come up here to say what I was going to say, I was going to congratulate Matthew Stafford on a big win yesterday to put down Tom Brady and lay down the goat to rest, hopefully. So today, most of you know today is the annual Dalton Day at the Freight Depot. It starts, I'm upside down, good, you're leaving. So we're starting a new series on these rugs called Explore Georgia. This rug is a picture of Fort Mountain, which separates my area from the speakers God country area. I look forward to seeing you down there. Just in case you don't know, over 70% of the world's carpet is made in the four counties of Whitfield Murray, Gordon and Bartow County. The industry employees over 50,000 employees, and there's $9 billion worth of revenue. Hope to see you out there tonight to get a rug and grab some grub. Have a good day. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Hobson for a morning order. Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, please join me in commending Jack and Jill of America Incorporated for 84 years of excellence and leadership in service today. On this day in 1938, Jack and Jill of America Incorporated was founded by the late Marion Stubbs Thomas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

We have several counties across the state of Georgia that we represent here. And so today, we just want to recognize Jack and Jill of America for its 84 years of service across our nation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Beth Moore for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. As we engage in a robust and spirited debate in this chamber about education policy, I wanted to extend two invitations for educational opportunities. First, if you didn't see it, our local news station, 11Alive, produced an amazing four-part series that follows a Canton, Georgia couple through their own personal education about what critical race theory truly means about diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as implicit bias training. So if you'd like to view that series, I just posted on Twitter this morning, it culminates in the couple's visit to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. And I would like to extend the invitation to every member of this chamber to join me for a special legislative tour of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights one week from today. So on Monday, January 31st, from 1 to 3 p.m., the center will be opening during their off hours, just four legislators. And so if you would like to join us for that event, please come and see me. I'll put you on the list and we'll make special accommodations for you to come and visit the center with me. Thank you so much. Chair recognizes representative McLeod for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning, everyone. I'm here today because on Tuesday, January 11th, President Joe Biden came to the state of Georgia to express the urgency of now to pass the freedom of vote act and the John Lewis Voting and Advancement Act because Republicans in this body voted to pass the most anti-voting laws since the 1960s Jim Crow era. SB 202 was based on a lie. A lie told by Donald Trump that he could not accept that he lost and basically people rejected him. I'm also here to state a few facts. July 4th, 1776 did not mark the independence of the Africans who were enslaved in this country. In 1787, the Constitution was not written with the hope, aspiration, and the needs of the enslaved. Black people still do not have a birthright to voting. It was achieved through federal intervention, wrapped in four amendments. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, the 15th Amendment given the former enslaved males, the ability to vote, and the 19th Amendment given women the ability to vote and the 26th Amendment given the ability of young people to vote over age 18. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down section five of the Voting Rights Act that protected its black citizens from Jim Crow era laws. In 2021, the Republicans in this body took full advantage of this and passed SB 202. This law codifies subversion. This body is willing to nullify the voices of their fellow American citizens. This is egregious. Our Republic and Representative Democracy is at stake. We are in a crisis moment. I will not be gaslighted by anyone in this body. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Weigh-Dower for a morning order. Well, good morning, colleagues. On this day, 20 years ago, I became a parent for the first time, which is one of the greatest blessings of my life. But that same year, there was another birth in Georgia when the Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education was formed. As I've watched Annabelle grow over the last 20 years, so has Georgia core, which has led the way for quality, innovated, and cutting-edge oncology services for all of Georgia's. These two things are closely related for me, because shortly after Annabelle was born, my wife was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer and given a 7% chance to live past five years. With limited options for her advanced illness, we were forced to leave Georgia and seek treatments and specialized surgeons. By the grace of God, we found them in a wonderful text as hospital many of you know of called MD Anderson. As you can imagine, this is scary and uncertain time for us, but having to leave our 10-month-old child behind, while we spent the majority of November and the center of that year in Houston recovering from her surgeries. It was the hardest thing we've ever had to do. Thankfully, that time waiver resulted in full recovery from my wife and her health today. But thanks to the efforts of the Georgia Corps advancing cancer care through partnerships and innovation, I can confidently say today that should a young Georgia family find themselves in the situation we were in, they would be able to receive those services here in Georgia. Additionally, Georgia Corps is looking to have a form, a advisory council to include legislative stakeholders who have an interest in continuing the fight against cancer and the promotion of oncology services here in Georgia. If this is something of interest to you, please come see me and Annabelle, happy birthday. I love you. Thank you. The Clark-Wary Decaption to a group of privileged resolutions.
