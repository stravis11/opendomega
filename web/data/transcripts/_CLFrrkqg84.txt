see the clerk's office sometime there in the morning and check in with your
attendants. Clerk will lock the machines.
Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well good morning.
I talked to Monday a little bit about unity and I talked about working
together and bipartisanship. And I want y'all to know, I really meant that. And I've proved
today how much I mean it.
It hurts, it hurts, but I'm doing it for the greater good.
Don't get, don't get a representative Reeve stirred up, he'll do a cheer back there.
So if I can do that, we can be unified.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 22nd House District
Representative Wes Cantrell, Representative Cantrell.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, good morning to you.
Our chaplain today is Pastor Christian Norman.
Pastor Norman is the associate pastor at the first Baptist Church of Woodstock, where I've
had the privilege of serving as the young adult pastor for the past 14 years.
He's one of my bosses, but when you see how big he is in a minute, you'll understand
that I'll pretty much do anything he tells me to do regardless of whether he's my boss
or not.
Pastor Norman was an outstanding football player in high school and received a full-ride scholarship
to play football at Michigan State University.
He excelled while there, culminating in being
the team captain, his senior season, honorable mention,
all conference and projected to be picked,
and NFL draft somewhere between rounds four and six.
Since moving to Georgia, Pastor Norman's favorite football
memory has become Michigan State's triple over time victory
over UGA in 2012, which apparently had an outstanding
game in.
The trajectory, though, of Pastor Norman's life,
was changed forever when he suffered a serious injury
in the Capital One Bowl playing against Alabama
at the end of his sophomore season.
And God used that injury to draw him into a relationship
with himself in a commitment to live for Christ
for the rest of his life, and really the opportunity
to live up to the name that his parents gave him, Christian.
After graduating from Michigan State University, Pastor Norman decided to forego the NFL draft
and instead attended the Moody Theological Seminary where he earned a Master's in Divinity
Degree.
He was Associate Pastor to Church in Detroit, Michigan for several years before moving
to Woodstock last year to serve as our Associate Pastor.
He's married to Kayla, who was an outstanding athlete herself, having played basketball
University of Florida. They have two children, Sophia and Christian J. Norman, the second who was
born just a few days before Christmas a month or so ago and they affectionately refer to him as
Duce. So join with me and let's welcome Pastor Christian Norman.
Good morning, but thank you all so much for giving me this incredible opportunity to
share with you the truth of God's Word and what He's put on my heart. I don't think
it's lost on anyone that we do live in incredibly divisive times. Just a few
a day's ago in my office, I was talking with a woman. She's a grandmother, probably in
her late 60s, early 70s. And right now, her sons aren't talking to her because she
votes differently, so much so that they may not let her see her grandkids. So what's
happening today is not just out in the ether. What's happening today is touching people
where it hits the hardest and that's at home.
So when my friend and colleague Wes came to me and said,
hey, would you consider speaking at the state capital,
I wondered, what would be a timely message?
What would be a relevant word for the times in which we live?
And he immediately said, without hesitation, unity.
So when he said that to me, I started to ask the Lord,
well, what's a good place in God's word
That talks about unity clearly.
And immediately the Lord brought to my mind
Psalm chapter 133 is one of my favorite songs,
and it says this,
behold how good and pleasant it is
when brothers dwell in unity.
It is like the precious oil on the head,
running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron,
running down on the collar of his roads.
It is like the dew of Herman,
which falls on the mountains of Zion.
for there the Lord has commanded the blessing,
namely, life, forevermore.
This is a short song.
And like I said before, it's one of my favorite songs,
because as a pastor, you have to deal with a lot of conflict.
And when there's individuals or people,
groups in the church that art arts,
I often think to myself how good and pleasant it would be
if we could dwell in unity.
But why does the psalmist say this?
When he talks about how good it is to dole and unity,
he draws a comparison between unity and the oil
that runs down the beard of Aaron
who would be the third highest ranking official
in the nation of Israel.
And he also compares it to the do that descends from
Mount Hermann onto the regions of Zion or Jerusalem.
So when he describes the goodness and the pleasantness
of dwelling in unity.
What he has in mind is the kind of unity
that sets a person apart.
When oil was placed on the head of Aaron,
it was to consecrate him
as a high-ranking official in the nation of Israel.
Not only that, but he also has in mind
the kind of unity that produces flourishing wine.
Because when do descend it from on herment,
it would provide the moisture that was necessary
for plant life in a hot and dry region of the world.
So in brothers,
dare I say when a nation dwells in unity,
it can set that nation apart.
Dare I say that when a nation dwells in unity,
it produces flourishing for the people that live in it.
But this morning can I also suggest that the converse is true,
that it's not good and it's not pleasant
when brothers dwell in disunity,
that it's not like the oil that runs down the beard of Aaron,
that it's not like the do that descends from on Herman.
Therefore, it does not lead to setting a nation apart,
and it does not lead to the people flourishing in it.
There was a great leader that existed a while ago,
I'm sure all of you are familiar with him,
his name is Abraham Lincoln.
When he accepted his ascended nomination
in the state of Illinois, he gave a speech on June 16th, 1858,
and he said that a house divided cannot stand.
Well, that great leader borrowed that line from the greatest
leader that the world has ever seen,
and he lived over 2,000 years ago.
And he's the greatest leader that the world has ever seen,
not because he bludgeoned his opponents,
not because he overthrew political systems
by sheer force.
He's the greatest leader that the world has ever seen
because he came to serve.
And in his service,
he lived a life that we couldn't live.
He died to death that we should have died,
but he was raised from the grave three days later
and is now exalted to the right hand of the throne of God.
And by faith in his name, by faith in his name,
do we have restoration?
It's about faith in His name
that we have peace with God and watch this.
We also have peace with one another.
If you hear me say anything on this Wednesday morning,
hear me say this, Jesus came so that people could be made
right with God and so that people could be made
right with one another.
Now, what can you do with that?
Well, there's two ways that I love for you guys
to apply this both personally and publicly.
Personally, this is my encouragement to you.
If you have conflict in your life,
maybe it's with a spouse,
maybe your marriage has been on the rocks,
maybe it's with your children,
maybe it's with a colleague that sits in this very room.
I don't know, wherever there's conflict in your life,
would you consider surrendering to the authority of Jesus?
Because when you surrender to the authority of Jesus, you all of a sudden have a reason and motivation to get right with other people.
I know that when I surrendered in my life to Christ almost ten years ago,
when I experienced God's forgiveness, when I experienced God's peace,
I was motivated to make phone calls to people that I knew I had offended.
I was motivated to tell somebody, I'm sorry, that our relationship was broken.
I was motivated to be reconciled, because if I had been reconciled, who in my to withhold
reconciliation from somebody else?
So if that's you, I'd ask you to consider surrendering your life to Jesus.
And then publicly, I recognize that personal piety can't translate into public policy,
but I would say this, learn from the life of Christ.
As you all represent your constituents, be an advocate for peace, I'd encourage you
practically to assume the best in one another.
I'd encourage you all practically to recognize that we have more in common than we have
not in common. I'd encourage you all to recognize the need to be reasonable and gentle in your
approach, even with those with whom you disagree. And I would encourage you all to recognize
that with leadership comes the burden of setting an example. In Psalm 133, I don't think it's
a mistake that the author described unity in such a way that it always descended.
It was like the oil that poured down the head of Aaron.
It was like the dude that came down from Mount Hermann.
So maybe just maybe the author is suggesting that if unity is going to be possible, it
must start from the top.
Amen.
Let's pray.
Father, we thank You for Your grace.
And, Lord, God, we thank You that we do have the possibility of unity.
When You sent Your Son, You sent the Prince of Peace.
Lord, You made a way not only for people to be reconciled to You, but also so that people could be reconciled to one another.
So God, I pray that by your grace,
and through the power of your spirit,
the people in this room will live, reconcile lives.
Personally, you've got to pray for peace and relationships.
You've got to pray for things like patience, kindness,
forgiveness, and long suffering.
But God, I do also pray for this nation.
And Lord, God, I do pray for this great state of Georgia.
You've got to pray that the people in this state
And my fellow countrymen at large would be unified.
This is a troubling time.
It times it feels like that's not even possible,
but there is nothing too hard for you.
So God be gracious to us.
Forgive us where we fall short.
And by all means help us to walk in unity.
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic which
it stands, a nation under God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for all.
Our keepers will unlock the doors.
The Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and
Audits.
Mr. Speaker, your committee on information audits has read the journal of the previous legislative
day and found it to be correct.
Chairman Hogan, the chair of the committee on information and audits reports that the
journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.
Is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?
the chair here's none in the journal is confirmed.
I think I have one more thing.
I thought you probably did.
As you remember, Speaker Murphy, he was quite an individual.
He had his light moments, but then he enjoyed himself quite a bit.
And back in 1999, and I might get in trouble for this, but I've cleared some of this with
your staff, but I'm not going to identify him.
Erica Murphy recognized Representative Ann Mueller and she stood up to speak and her
microphone was turned off and she said Mr. Speaker would you turn me on?
And he said 30 years ago I would have tried.

So that we can stay within the rule
Chair is going to ask that members limit their remarks to not more than one minute each.
Chair recognizes Representative Al Williams for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
56 years ago this April, I marched across the Edmund Pettis Bridge with John Lewis.
This morning, I stand to introduce a resolution to place a statue of him and statutory hall in
the United States Congress.
This is a moving and personal moment for me, but let me thank the speaker for his assistant,
both the majority and minority leader, the dean, and the past president of Georgia, like
Caucus representative Bennett.
only the road we tried, bitter the chastening rod. Felt in the day when hope unborn had died,
yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our father's
side. This will be available for signatures and I hope it's 100% in the cloak's office.
Thank you, Miss Speaker.
their recognizes Chairman Martin for a morning order.
Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today
and ask your prayer that I can get through this.
We all lose friends and community leaders
and none are more important than the other.
That said, I stand today to recognize and honor my friend, Tim Buster, not because of
his passing, but instead because of how he lived.
In just 52 years, Tim accomplished much.
He was the middle child of seven out of Miami, went to Eastern Kentucky University,
rushed for 3,640 yards, was a 10th round draft pick by Los Angeles.
He was known as the bus driver running in front of Jerome Batis at Pittsburgh.
for Emmett Smith. He was an NFL unsung hero in 1996 and 97. He was a coach at
Milton and Fellowship and he founded the Milton Steelers for kids in North
Fulton County that had no other way to get involved in sports. He led
speaking was a husband and a father. Mr. Speaker I say the light just give me one
more minute. Tim Lester was one of the best people in the world. His loss is
heartbreaking. In a world where people are experiencing so much angst, Tim was an ever-present
positive force, a man of good. He looked for and saw good in everyone, and more than that,
he left good behind him wherever he went. While he is now walking with God, the good he instilled
in so many, using God's grace is with us. Coach Leicester, you will be missed, yet your
Your impact has felt today and will be long felt in the future.
You made a difference.
Let each of us strive to bring people together and make that same difference for our community,
our state and our nation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Mitchell for a morning order.
Thank you. I think there was a slide. Oh, there we go. So I just have one minute to show
this to you, but I wanted to do a science morning order for you all. I know we see a lot
of information and we have a lot of questions from constituents about the implications of
the new strain of coronavirus that's here and that's been detected in one case in Georgia.
This is data from the UK from a modeling group who looked there to ask how fast does
this spread within the country, and is it more transmissible from individual to individual
than previous strains?
On the left, you can see that it took six weeks to go from one health district in the
UK to all of the health, almost all of the health districts in the UK, which there are
199.
On the right, what you're looking at is how many people get infected, given the conditions
in the UK from a person who has older strains of coronavirus or one who has new strains
of coronavirus. On the bottom, you can see that that number is around one with the system
that the UK had in place in November and December for older strains of coronavirus. So on
average, they were under control with intervention. However, the newer strains are on the Y-axis,
and you can see that that number averages about 1.5. So despite the dramatic intervention
that was in place in the UK that was still able to transmit and the epidemic was able
to rise. So we just need to be aware there is real data behind the public information
coming to people and we can find that data and understand it as well. I'm happy to have
a conversation with that.
Ladies, time has expired. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Workhizer for a morning
order? I can miss Speaker today's version of why we do things the way we do
starts with a press conference that the speaker had with the media before
session started not the recent one but last year and standing in front of a
large group of media I don't know what the question was but I remember what
the answer was and he started pointing at members of the media and he said I
I wish that every one of you could stand where I stand every day.
And look out and see a white, a black, a young, an old, rural suburban.
I don't know if you know this or not, but we're actually pretty unique in the way we sit.
And that gives him, and his reasoning to the meaty was the perspective it gives him,
And it should give us, and we heard about unity this morning.
So I guess my challenge with that is get to know your neighbor, and especially those
who vote differently from you.
My time is up.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Speaker.
Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House, leader Beverly, for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I don't want to bury the headline.
I want to talk about friendship today, but before I do that, I thought about a morning
order that would address the happenings of last week at the nation's capital.
And I thought about when the insurrection started, if there were a group of Black Lives
Matter folk, who did the insurrection, what that would look like, but that didn't happen,
so my mind continued at Rome.
I thought about where we are right now, and Mr. the coronavirus, Mr. Speaker, I tried
to go to sleep last night so I read the rest of the rule book and I got to rule 175 that
talks about how leader burns and I and you should confer about what we should do in electronic
voting as we move forward in emergency.
And I was really about to wind it down in an image of my friend, William Bowdie popped
up.
William Bowdie is a very dear friend of mine.
If y'all don't know, we ran against each other for leader and I prevailed on Monday.
He lost his grandmother, his second grandmother in two weeks, and so I'd like for y'all
to rise for just a second to honor Miss Lula, who passed on Monday.
William Bowdie spoke to me for 30 minutes about what I was struggling with right after
he found out that his grandmother passed, and that's the measure of a man.
So, Mr. Speaker, I'd give honor to William Bowdie, my dear friend, and honor his grandmother
and his family.
Please keep him in your prayers.
Let me speak on you to well.
Chair recognizes representative Bernal for a morning order.
Good morning, Mr. Speaker.
This morning, representatives Marie Metz, Sheila Johnson,
Camilla Hobson, and I are here this morning
to celebrate the 108th Founders' Day
of our beloved sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority,
Incorporated.
Our sorority was founded in 1913 by 22 phenomenal
trendsetters who saw no limit to their vision
for sisterhood scholarship and service.
Delta's founders stepped out on faith
to march with the surfer jets and took a stand
for social justice as their first public act.
More than 107 years later, we pride ourselves
by following the footsteps of our founders,
and remain in the forefront of action
as a voice for those in need.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.
Chair recognizes representative drier
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Seven days ago, white nationalist attempted
a violent coup against the United States,
and five people lost their lives,
including two members of law enforcement.
Two bombs were deactivated at the headquarters
of the RNC and DNC.
A gallows was erected in front of the Capitol
and the Confederate flag and white nationalist flags
flew inside the Capitol Rotunda.
But despite this trees and our democracy held,
these actions were precipitated by thousands upon thousands
of lies about our election system.
most by the current president but aided and abetted by accomplices across the country
in our government and some right here in Georgia. To ensure we merge stronger, we need a
full public accounting of everyone that contribute to this by acts or words. The calls for unity
should happen but they can only happen if there is the truth and the truth is exposed
and those responsible are held accountability,
because we cannot have reconciliation without truth.
I urge my colleagues to join this call
for a full accounting and our democracy
will continue to hold.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Scott
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise to bring attention to the fact that hundreds of thousands of Georgia out of work
due to no fault of their own, and we can't even put our finger on the exact number of
them because of lots of data mismanagement and unreturned requests.
The data presented on the label website is misleading, and we all know that the language
to matters in statistics.
There are four types of claims.
Valid, invalid, claims that have received at least one
payment, claims where a payment has been requested.
The press releases on the website this month only
speak to initial claims, though instead
of the numerous other categories that
truly matter like unpaid claims, claims and appeals
are denied claims.
This is very troubling, so a group of legislators
formed the task force over the summer,
and we could not believe that it is the new year,
and we still don't have clear data.
In the last six months of all,
my office has sent 100 constituent claims forward
to the Department of Labor,
and I have no record of resolution to show
for the legislative inquiry.
This is not-
Ladies' time has expired.
Okay, that completes our morning.
I'm sorry, one more.
Chair recognizes representative Lewis Ward
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
colleagues, myself and my colleague,
Representative Demetrius Douglas,
bring sad news to you this morning about the untimely death
of a community leader, husband, dad,
servant of God, and our spiritual father.
This Monday, 51-year-old Spencer T. O. Niel,
who is a senior pastor of Global Impact Christian Ministries,
located in Stockbridge, Georgia, unexpectedly
transitioned from labor to reward.
It's unfortunate, but it's true that we never know
whether our actions or our words will be the last ones.
On Monday, we all also gathered here
at the House of Representatives to celebrate the beginning
of a new legislative session.
And also one that day, the Lord reminded us
that in order to live in his house,
we must be pure and hot, thoughts, and deeds.
Past the spends's global impact will continue
to be transformative, and we will miss
by everyone who knew him.
Let's pause for a moment of silence.
Thank you, I yell a well.
That completes morning orders. The clerk will now read the caption to a group of privilege
resolutions honoring the life and memory of Pastor Spencer T. O'Neill honoring the life
and memory of Thomas Raymond coach Montgomery honoring the life and memory of Heather Holloway
Recognizing commending, Dana Chastain for receiving the 2019 Stetson F Bennett clerk of the
year award, honoring the life and memory of Reverend Dr. Glenn L. Etheridge.
Recognizing and commending Jim Galloway upon the grand occasion of his retirement and
for all the purposes that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to the adoption, to adopting the privileged resolutions?
The chair here is done and the resolutions are adopted.
Before we complete our work, if I could have your attention please, if I could have your
attention please, first of all tomorrow is Thursday.
What do we do on Thursday?
Bless you.
You will get a memo later today with complete details, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. testing here in
this building.
Secondly, we are social distancing, which I know is inconvenient and uncomfortable for
many.
But again, I told you all Monday that my priority is to make sure the members of this body
and staff and others that have to be here, that their health is protected.
And so we have to social distance, which means that we have limited seating on the floor,
and then we have to seat in the gallery and we have to seat in 341.
