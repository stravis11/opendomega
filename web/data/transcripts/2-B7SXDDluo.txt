TRANSCRIPT
----------
So we will get started, we do have a quorum and Senator Eccles, would you do the invocation
for us to your number 12, is that it?
Let us pray.
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for today, Lord.
Thank you for allowing us to be here to do the work of the people of Georgia.
I pray that you'll give us clear minds as we make decisions and let us do what is best
for Georgia, your name, I pray, amen.
Amen.
We're gonna have a presentation.
I may let Senator Hawkins go ahead here.
The presentation is gonna be first,
but I'm thinking you might be quick
just because we voted on this pretty much before.
So if you wanna come on up to the mic.
All right, how you today, Mr. Chair,
either one you want, we'll turn it down.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And let me start first and say we heard
from Senator Eccles, a similar bill.
I think yours has one change to it.
Yes.
It passed down, I think there may be a couple of no votes.
So it may not be an animal's vote,
but probably be similar lines again.
So tell us maybe the difference
between what she had and what you think that she had the .75 still in there yeah and
the .75 was taken out by advisement at ACCG and that .75 you're referring to for the
committee members is that if the county goes it alone without the city's exactly right
that's exactly right because house bill 946 is a house bill we're talking about LC number
500730S. Right now, T-splots is the only splot that requires a 100% dissipation. So we have had
counties in this state lose their T-splots because one city or one municipality decided
not to sign the IGA. We had to the last time that we tried doing a T-splot. One was
Trest Haven of 45 people, the other one is Buford,
it comes into part of Hall County.
And so the 7.5 that Senator Eccles,
I was referring to, was what you would,
what the T spots would be based on,
if it was not a unanimous vote.
Hall County decided not to do that
because of all the computations
in all the other situations that would arise with that.
This bill cleans that up.
So as long as you have over 50% of the municipality
population, municipalities in favor of the teach blocks,
then the teach blocks will be put on a referendum
for the people to vote for.
And I said, this bill has been agreed to by GMA,
ACCG and the Chamber of Commerce.
Everybody's kind of thumbs up on this bill.
Okay, any questions of the sponsor of the bill?
We've got a couple of people signed up to speak, including I think maybe the administrator
of Hall County, but I don't know if that's necessary, really, it's up to the committee.
Everyone okay to go ahead and vote with any further testimony.
We've seen this same bill with one change taking out the option of the county's going
it alone. Okay, is that Senator Taylor? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's
important to point out Chairman Hawkins that if there is not unanimity,
doesn't this bill drop it down? It's not a 10-year referendum or a 10-year
tax, it's a six-year tax. Correct. Thank you for saying that. Yes. Yeah, we've
heard from counties around the state that it's an extra year allows them a
a little more time to get things up and going.
So yes, thank you, that's a good point.
No other questions is the committee.
I mean, our motion now, if we feel like we're ready,
we've got a motion from Senator Eccles,
their second from Senator Avatarte,
any other discussion?
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hand.
Okay, and all opposed.
Senator Ork, did you vote either way or?
Okay. So your bill passes and who's your sponsor over here?
Senator Eccles.
Good choice.
I think so. Sort of cute too, isn't she?
Yeah. All right.
We've got Kyle Wingfield here
with a presentation for the committee if you want to come up.
There was a lot of work done over the off session.
We haven't know.
Okay, so the floor's yours, I'll tell the committee.
Part of this was Rhea Headerman who's been working a lot of states.
with us some over the off session our committees that some of the people here
were part of the the tax credit study committees and I think I've got it right
you're gonna start on page 14 and go through all the derivatives there in
the presentation and break down for everybody that didn't have calculus
three how those formulas work but I think we'll just do an after-class
to her in session on that and y'all can tell me how those things work, but yes no thank you
Mr. Chairman and members of this committee I'm sorry somebody said I didn't
introduce you properly Kyle Wingfield get introduced up and I'm address for the
record if you would yes Kyle Wingfield on the present CEO of the Georgia Public
Policy Foundation and Georgia Policy Impact and we as you know are a think tank
And based here in Atlanta, we work on state public policy issues and as the Chairman alluded,
we participated in the tax credit study committee this summer and brought down our rather
had via Zoom, our colleague from Ohio Ray Hederman from the Buckeye Institute, our sister
think tank and Ohio, which has a center that does economic modeling.
And so after the discussion that Ray had with the study committee, we took some things
that we'd heard that were of interest to people and commissioned this modeling study that
Buck I put together for us in which we published a couple of weeks ago.
So I'll go through that in a moment, but I wanted to start with just kind of some kind
opening thoughts in terms of how we approached this and how we approach tax policy generally.
As many of you know, Georgia is a low tax state. You can see that by virtually every metric
that is out there. However, we compete in a very highly competitive region when it comes
to taxes. So we're sandwiched between two zero income tax states in Tennessee and Florida.
to our Northeast, we have North Carolina, which 10 years ago
had a higher income tax rate than Georgia does,
and through some steady reductions of that rate,
it has now come to have a lower rate than we do.
And that's both on the personal side and the corporate side.
So, and then we compete with states like Texas, of course,
which are not neighbors of ours,
but, you know, and we compete nationally, obviously,
for workers, for talent, for companies, for investment,
that sort of thing.
So it's important to note that just because we're doing well
from a tax rate standpoint,
doesn't mean we've done all the work that there is to do,
because no state is sitting idly by.
And that's particularly true over the last few years
as states have seen lots of revenue come in,
and they're trying to figure out, okay, how do we adjust?
And we've seen lots of states adjust by cutting those rates.
Now, how the state raises this revenue is also matters, just the fact that where a low
tax state is not the only important fact, there's good bit of agreement among economists
that different taxes have different effects on the economy.
Some of them are more harmful to the economy than others, so income taxes versus sales
taxes, for instance.
So it's important to look at the structure of the code in addition to how much money it
raises.
And then the final point that we come to the table with is that, generally speaking,
the private sector spends money more productively than the public sector.
Now that doesn't mean that the public sector doesn't do important things, if that were
the case, you know, Chairman Tillery could come in and put zeros in the budget and
y'all could go home after a couple of days.
Obviously, the state funds some very important functions and must continue to do so.
But when it comes down to a decision of do we do a little bit more here, do we do a
little bit more there from an economic standpoint, from growing the economy, you know, you
want to err on the side of giving that dollar back to the private sector rather than
finding another way to spend it here in the public sector.
So with all that said, those are the, that's kind of the outline here.
And we had the four scenarios modeled.
I believe you have these in front of you.
If you turn to page six scenario one
was accelerating the tax cuts
that this body passed in 2022, House Bill 1437,
and extending them.
So if you look at this table number one,
the top part of each of these tables
represents the baseline.
That's tax according to current statute
in terms of the rate.
These are projections of state GDP,
the number of jobs in the state, tax revenues,
consumption, and investment.
And then the bottom part of each table
represents what would happen according to the models
if changes were implemented.
So in the bottom part of this table, one on page six,
you can see that the tax rate goes down about twice as fast
at this under this scenario and ends up
going a percentage point farther,
so going overall about twice as far as current law holds.
And what you see there is that you get a big boost
in state GDP, you see about by the end of this,
you would see about 16,000 more jobs,
more investment, more consumption,
and ending at a tax rate of 3.99.
The second scenario was we asked, it's employment, it's about 42 column, so the 25, 79, 11, 14, 16 is what?
That would be, so when you got to, on the first line, 2024, if you were at a 5.19 percent tax rate,
you would expect to have 2,000 more jobs
than the baseline number in the top part of the table.
Those are the sales.
The 2,000, yes.
Yes, these are all in thousands.
OK, thank you.
Well, those numbers are in thousands.
Some of the others are larger.
Page six.
Page five describes the scenario and page six has the table.
Looks like. Looks like this. So we're on five on our sheet. Oh, I say, okay, okay, that's
it's number six on mine. Yes, yes. Scenario one, table one. Then Scenario two, table two,
it, instead of lowering the personal income tax, it actually looks at eliminating the
corporate income tax over a period of five years.
And so you can see the same baseline top of the table, and this is table two, and then
the projections from the model on the bottom of the table.
What I draw your attention to here is if you look at the last number in both table one
and table two, and they're next to each other on mine, it looks like they may be on
opposite pieces of paper for y'all, so it's a little bit harder to do.
When you get to the end here, you've cut twice as much tax revenue on the personal side,
but the growth to GDP is actually greater on the corporate side, and that's because of
the much higher level of investment that you get.
So what I would tell you that kind of take away from that is when you're looking at the
most bang for your buck when cutting taxes you're going to get a larger economic response
from cutting on the corporate side than on the personal side.
And in fact there's a couple of lines here where you can see where they line up exactly
on the tax revenue side.
Table three and I'm trying to go through this quickly because I know you'll have questions.
Let's go back to table one there.
I think people may still be confused on this a little bit from I'm sensing that in the
room I guess.
But there let's let's go on our page five there.
The tax revenue is at $33 million now you're saying it $20 30 if the tax rate was $4.99
percent would be bringing in $38.8 billion that's right.
You would have growth that would be increasing taxes you'd be cutting the tax rate would
be decreasing taxes. And then the chart at the bottom is, I guess, going down from
$5.19 to $3.99. How much tax revenue is lost from the price line by doing that?
Yes. So when you get to the bottom of that table at $3.99, the tax revenue shows
a minus $4.9 billion. So that's how much you would subtract from that $38.8. And that's
tell you what you would have at that point.
And one of the things I guess the calculations try to figure out, I try to put it in
non-calculus terms or something, if you were at a zero percent tax rate, you would bring
in the zero dollars.
If you were at a hundred percent tax rate, you might also bring in zero dollars because
who's going to work if the government takes a hundred percent of it?
And so in between, it's a little bit fluid and you try to drive economic activity versus
taxes where you're going to be at and I think that's obviously we can't get
it to the calculations the economists use back on page 14 and on but that's
sort of where we're at on that so your tax revenue in 2030 where you're going
down you're 3.99% and the tax revenue you've lost what are the assumptions in
that, that you haven't made any changes in your budget or?
So this is just looking at the revenue sign, that's right.
So it's not trying to project versus spending or anything like that.
It's just telling you how much revenue would be projected to come in.
I will point out, these are inflation-adjusted numbers, so these are all, so you would see
these numbers plus some measure of inflation.
kept constant to try to make comparisons.
That's a good point that inflation has been taken out of these numbers.
The way that, just if I could very simply explain how the model works, you're familiar
with a lot of economic models where they use a multiplier to try to say, well, if you
increase this spending, then that's going to go, then someone's going to spend that
dollar and so on, and so it really matters what multiplier you use.
This model doesn't do that.
What this model does is it tries to take the empirical data based on when similar changes
have been made in the past.
What was the response?
In other words, when a state cut taxes by this amount, how many jobs were created above
what was expected.
So, it's not trying to calculate how many times money is going to move through the economy.
It's trying to say, okay, based on what we've seen in the past, this is what we would
expect to happen if this, if this were done.
That's the way this particular model works.
All right, Roger.
Your armors.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Kyle, great to see you.
Appreciate all the great work you've written forward to us.
So in looking at your chart, you know,
going down to the 3.99% tax rate.
So it's an offset of a co-op for round numbers,
$5 billion, a budget impact.
As other states have done this, obviously,
they've had to find either some type of offsetty
that they're growing fast enough.
They could absorb those.
or they added taxes in other areas,
such as market facilitator, things that nature
to make sure we're even with main street.
Has anybody been doing what we're doing
is looking at those tax credits
that some are not providing return on investment
and could easily fill some of this gap in?
I believe there are some states that are looking at that.
I couldn't give you a state by state breakdown,
but I'd be happy to do kind of a roundup
and get that back to you later.
One thing that we've seen the state of Iowa,
attempt to do is set aside some money in what they call a taxpayer relief fund and the
idea would be you're going to have to match your budget you're spending to your revenues
but while times are good and you've brought in more revenues you could set some of that
aside and then if revenues come in short of what you've projected you've got some money
to pull out of reserve and dedicate toward that and make the budget whole to kind of smooth
the transition as you're doing that.
So that would be outside of a traditional rainy day fund then.
Yes.
Okay.
And then I know you've helped us and looked at some of the measurements that we've done
over the last few years especially and certainly some have come back positive but a great
many have come back with an upside down ROI and could be a great way to help all Georgians.
Very well could be.
Yes.
Well North Carolina is an example.
You mentioned them that have gone down to 3.99 or trying to get it lower.
They quit matching the federal R&D tax credit as an example.
Our film tax credit that I think is at $1.4 billion, that would be what, $1,400 million.
They made a cap of don't even follow the floor out there, $31 million was their cap up
in North Carolina on that tax credit because their theory was, if we reduce everybody's
taxes, we actually get more growth than picking the winters and leaves our center.
Or Rocky, we're next.
On your introductory remarks in the second paragraph, it includes a sentence that says Georgia
looks unlikely to continue to attract or retain relocating workers without more competitive
tax reforms.
How do you support that given our meteoric growth in job creation and attracting incredibly
important of manufacturing and particularly in the EV space and in the battery space.
I mean, how do you support that sentence that you assert there that we look unlikely to
continue to attract or retain relocating workers?
Well, the differentiation there between what we're talking about, you're talking about
job creation, which is the company creating jobs.
What this is talking about is the workers to fill those jobs.
And I know that that's been a very important topic during this session.
We all recognize that we are growing jobs at a rate that's faster than we're growing
workers who are prepared to fill those jobs.
We've got to bring people in to fill those.
And if you're someone who is thinking about moving to another state, one of the big factors
you're going to take into account is what is the return of my own work?
is that at what rate will I be taxed
if I go to Georgia versus another state?
And so that would be the thinking behind that sentence
is that we're not talking about the employers,
we're talking about the employees to fill those jobs,
because as you say, the state has had a very great record
in recent years in particular in attracting companies,
but we need people to fill the jobs that they're creating
and the people to fill the jobs
of what this is talking.
And you think people stay away from here
because our tax rate is too high?
I don't know that there is that the underlying assumption.
I think the assumption would be they're not moving here
in the numbers, they could be moving
if we made it more attractive to them on this front.
Now obviously people have lots of different factors
that they can do account, but this is a big one.
I just think that's hard to support.
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.
I'm still having trouble with the chart.
I should have in trouble, and I'm not being too thickheaded only, but I'm still having
under trouble with not enough zeros on the numbers or what the titles mean with you.
And I know we've got time as an issue here too, and we probably need to study and then
come back.
But just on the personal income tax, I mean, kind of walk down and tell what I know what
gross domestic product means and employment means and tax revenue.
I don't know what consumption means, I don't know what investment means, and then come
on down through the holes.
So consumption is, so you've got the tax rate, you've got the tax rate, and then the
year that it supplied to, just got it left to right.
You've got the state GDP in the next columns.
That's how large the state's economy is.
Then you've got employment, how many people are employed, that's in thousands.
These other numbers are generally in millions.
Then you've got tax revenue, how much is coming in.
And then you've got consumption, consumer spending,
how much are consumers in the economy spending,
and then investment.
How much is being invested, whether it's
into a new business or into expanding a business,
or that sort of thing?
So how many zeros have to go in those numbers?
That's what I'm.
And so if you look at the tax revenue number,
you're going to add six zeros there.
Six zeros?
Yes. Okay. That's probably why I'm struggling with it.
Okay. On three zeroes on the employment census of thousands. Thank you.
I appreciate it. It wouldn't have fit on the page if we included all the zeroes, unfortunately.
Yeah. Well, it looks like we did something anyway. Okay.
Okay. And we're going to get shortened on for the same year.
I'll send her. I'll just go ahead. I'll read it.
Mr. Wingfield, thank you for bringing this. The proper way to evaluate
the four scenarios to try to chart a path forward the best path forward how do you do that?
I mean you I mean can you just look at each one and take
You got an increase you got you got a fall-off in tax revenues, but you've got an increase in GDP
Increasing consumption increase in investment would you add those and those three and compare against the tax revenue
How do you wisely go about looking at these four scenarios and say, we need to do one or two or three or four, we need to do a mix or I mean I read your conclusion it basically said keep the tax rate under four percent.
So I think the way that I would answer that
is to say it really depends on what the priorities
of the General Assembly are.
Are you trying to grow the state's economy as fast as you can?
Are you trying to attract workers, you know,
to the earlier conversation we were having?
You're growing jobs, but are you attracting people
to fill those jobs?
I think you have to decide what your policy priority,
what your goal priority is, and then these scenarios help
tell you, OK, if that's your priority,
then you want to look at something along these lines.
And the scenarios really are meant to look rather different
so that you can have a diverse menu of options here.
It's not so much to say you should cut this tax rate
by this amount in this year, so much as directionally,
if you go in this direction, you're
going to boost the economy the most.
You're going to get the most bang for your buck that way.
and so on through the other priorities that you can set.
All right.
Senator Estabelle.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
No.
Really quick.
Do these calculations, particularly on the consumption and investment side, take into
account, similar to what Vistralvers was talking about, you make up the money somewhere.
So whether it's fees, whether it's increase in sales tax, whether it's increase in property
taxes, take into account the fact that consumption may be impact.
by what's happening in other areas?
No, this simply looks at the results
of making this policy change.
If you made other policy changes to accommodate that,
then there would be other effects from that, right?
We didn't model, for instance,
like trying to do a overall revenue neutral
while cutting the income tax by this amount.
You would have the effects of, well,
the government's going to spend less
or we're going to raise sales to whatever,
As you mentioned, there's a lot of different options.
You could have at that point.
This simply looks at this particular policy change,
and then you would have to look at, okay,
if we wanted to achieve this goal,
then we would either need to reduce spending
by that amount or we'd need to offset
somewhere else, that kind of thing.
I would point out, since we've had some talk
about tax credits, table four in scenario four,
we asked them to look at what if you cut tax expenditures
across the board by 500 million, and that would be tax deductions, exemptions, credits.
That's what we mean when we say tax expenditures.
And then lowered personal income taxes by the same 500 million.
What would be the effect?
And you'll see a lot of zeros here.
And so what that tells us is the model says, one, it can't quite go finely enough to any
particular change, and this doesn't really specify which credits we're talking about
anyway. But the most important takeaway from that is what matters from an economic standpoint
is how much is coming out of the economy to be spent by the government rather than staying
in the economy to be spent by private actors. So that's really the main takeaway from
that table four and that sort of highlights it that a revenue neutral change doesn't necessarily
to give you the economic growth, where you get the growth
is by keeping more money in the hands
of your private sector rather than spending it
as a state government.
All right, and I think Senator Tilbury had a question.
He's been waiting for a speech.
Right, enough.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but is this on my life?
I'm going to use this one.
I don't really have a question as much as I have a comment,
and I want to tell you, I want to cut income tax
as much as I can.
and or much that we can.
That being said, I will tell you,
my son lived in Tennessee for three years.
He said it was very expensive to live there.
He's moved back to Georgia
and he's so happy to be back in Georgia
and he is paying income tax,
but he's saving a lot more money.
So I think you, you know,
we got to look at the whole picture.
So I just want to caution everybody
that, you know, some of these states
that don't have income tax,
they get you in other ways
and he noticed it.
And now he notices it.
Now he bought a house series back.
He's married, and he loves being here,
and he's saving a lot more money, living in Georgia.
Yeah, and I think Georgia has,
you've got obviously the Kansas model,
where they cut and hope the revenue would come.
You've got North Carolina that's been a measure approach
over the last 10 years,
and we've been even much more cautious than them, I think.
And we certainly don't wanna go out there and do anything
beyond that.
Is that Senator Red that's got a question?
We're gonna go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Kyle.
You know my position on income tax.
I think Georgia's still 47, 48, 49 in per capita spending.
My question is on all these models,
did any of them show a reduction in income tax
that did not result in an employment growth?
So I think if you're running,
I mean, even when they run the trackers for the hurricanes,
you know, there's always this wild one that never comes here and goes to
Vermuda. Is there was there any that didn't show job growth or consumption
growth or investment growth at some point? These are the only four we ran. So we
didn't run 20 and pick forward to show you. We designed four and said, let's see
what they say. So you probably you might create one that that would come up
with something like that.
I guess, tagging on that, do you know my measurement?
Do you, other states that have tried this,
have they seen, have you seen a state
or no of a state that you can give us a point two
that they made one of these changes
and did not see either the increase in state GDP, jobs
or consumption?
The chairman mentioned Kansas,
and I think that's kind of the cautionary tale
that where the idea was we're going to cut taxes
and we're not going to do anything else to match that
and we're gonna count on growth to make up the difference.
And that has proven not to work.
So you're going to have to offset the changes
either by making cuts to the budget
that you're willing to live with
or by raising revenues elsewhere
that you're willing to live with.
So I guess the disastrous scenario would be
We're just going to make this one change,
and we're not going to account for it anywhere else.
And growth makes up for a portion of the revenue loss,
but only a portion.
It's not going to make up the entirety of it,
or even the majority of it, in the short term.
And that might have big gut, too.
Senator Rhett, I was just going to say
that we need to make sure we move with caution,
because I remember when I took economics one on one,
They would always emphasize that this is a model or vacuum.
In the real world, anything can happen like a tsunami or a pandemic, military mobilization.
I know you want to get to a certain rate, but I just wanted to state that we should exercise,
caution us to how fast we move.
And I think we have been cautious and we also have real-world examples of other states
that we can model after and say, they did this.
don't do that. The state's got a $68 billion deficit, whatever they did, don't do that.
The state cut their taxes below us. Maybe we want to look at what they did. So yeah, we've
got to be conscious and we've got to do it the right way. I saw there was a lot on over here
that went off. Go ahead. This is a comment maybe to even somewhat, not trying to, but
contradict what Senator Rest said. The House sent us a bill a couple of years ago to immediately
go to 4.99% and had we done that, we would have had the revenue. And we would have had
the revenue last year, we would have had the revenue this year. I don't, I guess my
question for you is how do you juxtapose that with Kansas, right? So we, the Senate put
the throttle on there to phase it in over eight years or whatever we've done. At least
in the years we've had so far we know that has not been necessary. So do you have to overlay
that with migration patterns because obviously the growth of the state here is very different
from Kansas and would that not give a different result because how we go on to even four
and a half percent when the House sent us the bill that went to 4.9 and we would have had
the revenue and still had a surplus.
Certainly, the economic conditions were entirely different when Kansas made its change versus
the last couple of years that we've seen here in Georgia.
So you do have to take account of those things.
I think what I would describe to kind of get it at the two comments here, I think what
I would just, the way I would describe these scenarios is more aggressive than current
policy, but not recklessly so, you know.
So going faster, because we've seen revenue continue to remain strong, even as it's been
slowing down, it's not really falling off a cliff at this point.
We're not reverting back to the preinflationary numbers from a revenue standpoint.
So this really is, we've talked about an accelerator for the tax cuts that were passed two years
ago.
This is a faster accelerator, you might say, than that.
But without going, jumping directly to 399 or something like that in one fell swoop.
Follow up to that.
Since we did not go to the 499, we were put in a position of refunds as opposed to a lower
rate.
So you all looked at, or even not, I know you haven't here, but at a macro level, the
value of these kind of responding to surplus with refunds versus a lower rate across the
board.
Does that, would that impact these employment numbers at all due to predictability?
We didn't model that, but I would say generally, I think it's fair to say that it is better
from an economic standpoint to set rates and lower rates and give businesses and employees
something to expect coming down the road rather than to hand them back some of their
money in a rebate. It should, it's going to drive investment which is going to help smooth
some of the inflation that you might see from some of that rather than just giving people,
if you think about a rebate is giving people back more money for what they already did,
lowering rates in the future is incentivizing them to do more, to work more, to save more,
to invest more, and that's what grows the economy.
So we, I think generally speaking, it's safe to say that it's preferable to provide
tax relief through rate cuts rather than a rebate.
And I guess I would add to that, we're not talking about cutting services.
I always like pouring on our teachers and the state of Georgia have the highest average
by anywhere in the South and Texas, Virginia.
That's another argument we're saying.
What will be the right that will get us growth
in the state and create jobs.
Services aren't really a part of this discussion.
How much longer have you got on your presentation?
There might be another question or two.
I think I've made most of the points I wanted to make.
So I know that the committee has a lot of work to do today.
I'm happy to stick around until after the hearing though
and speak with anyone who wants to be able to speak.
Senator, one more question here.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Earlier in your remarks, I believe you said something
to the effect that this approach, this analysis,
did not include the multiplier effects of money spent
by government in the economy.
And I'm not sure why you would leave that out.
That's number one.
And then number two, what do we make of the fact
that during the pandemic, when the federal government
made major infusions of money to the states and into the economy.
And we flourished in that setting with this infusion of federal investment, and we pulled
back from a real negative projection that we had expected as a result of going into this
pandemic.
And in fact, we flourished our economy flourished and grew and helped contribute to this big surplus
that we have.
So how do you account for one, why would you not look at the multiplier effect?
That's the basic part of the picture.
And two, we had the real-life demonstration of the infusion of public funds into the economy
and solve significant, healthy growth.
So to answer your first question, the reason,
as I understand it, that our colleagues at the book
I institute don't use the multiplier approach,
is because you've got to pick what number you use
as the multiplier.
And the one thing that I think you can be certain of
is whatever number you pick is not going to be the right number.
You might be close to the right number.
You might be far from the right number,
but you're just sort of picking a number and saying,
Well, we think this is what it's going to be.
What they've done instead is look at the record,
the historical record, and say, all right, when states
have changed their tax policy, what happened?
And they've pulled all that into the model.
So in a way, it is acknowledging that money is going to move
and that there's going to be growth.
But instead of picking a number and trying to base everything
on that, it's taking the totality of the changes
that have been seen across a lot of different changes.
So empirical data, rather than a forecast, I guess,
is the way that I would try to describe it
as the difference in approach.
But you're not doing a multiplier on anything
or the private money.
If I understand all those Greek letters and formulas
at the back correctly, that's right.
That's right, okay.
And then for the second thing,
the sheer volume of money that was put into the economy
was bound to have an effect.
What we're arguing here is that the greater effect
and the more efficient way to grow the economy
is to reward people for working,
saving and investing more,
rather than handing them more money regardless.
So I got the check, the pandemic relief check.
I didn't work anymore to do that.
I didn't produce anymore.
I tried to go ahead and spend it to get into the economy
because I understood that was the effect
or the intended use of that money.
But it didn't change my behavior in the sense of what
the fundamentals of the economy need to grow,
which are work savings and investing.
So that would be the distinction we would draw.
You can put more money into the economy,
and something's going to happen.
But we believe the more efficient and effective use
of that money is to give people an incentive
to do the things that you would like them to do,
the things that are the building blocks of the economy.
And the money was put into the economy
by the federal government in a very bipartisan manner.
No doubt.
And it did cause growth no doubt.
The downside of that is because of the deficits,
we were spending about $300 billion on interest.
Now our interest rates have climbed over $1 billion
on a $4 trillion budget.
So if we, as a state, were saying,
over 25% of our budget is going to go to interest,
we'd be in big trouble around here.
And that continuing interest, which look has been a climb,
That's the problem with that.
Yeah, if we max out our credit cards in a year,
we can have a really good year,
and then we've got to pay them off the next year,
we're in trouble.
The federal government kind of did that,
and they probably needed to do some of it
to keep the economy going.
But there was a big downside as well,
for what they did.
Senator Audius, I guess you can have a last word here.
Thank you.
Kyle, wouldn't you say that you really did use a multiplier
rather than project in one, you used what actually happened
when states took these actions.
So money did move around, and there was a multiplier,
and this is actually the actual effect
of what happened as opposed to picking one out of the air
and putting it in.
You can think about it similarly.
I'm trying to avoid the word multiplier,
because I think there's kind of a technical use of that
term, and that's not what was done.
But yes, it's acknowledging that when you incentivize people
to work more, they're going to work more,
and that's going to put more money into the economy.
When you incentivize them to save more and invest more,
they're going to do those things,
and that's going to build the economy.
So you can think about it that way.
I'm just trying to keep my technical jargon
as clean as I can.
All right, we certainly appreciate your presentation.
Obviously, I had a lot of interest in the committee,
and if you'll get offline and get
through the derivatives starting on page 14 with everybody,
afterwards make sure everybody's good on all of it.
here at 10 o'clock tonight and we'll we'll go through all that. So thank you for your time
today. All right is Representative Perkel here did he make it in? I know he was tied up in another
committee. I tried to fill a buster to get him here but I don't think I did so I guess we'll
catch that on the Wednesday meeting and we'll be adjourned. It's it's right now it's four o'clock
unless I get an earlier meeting.
Can you get me an earlier meeting?
Say, well, all the subcommittee meetings and corporations
who are committee members keep in my public opinion.
They try to cancel me because
some guys really need the meeting.
Yeah, I mean.
So.
I'm interested in getting more information.
Here's, uh.
