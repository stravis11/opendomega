TRANSCRIPT
----------
And also our leader over here, Senator Steve Goot, for being here as well.
You know, we're going to have many initiatives when it comes January for the upcoming session.
But one of them that I think is going to be a priority of ours, and I think it's very
reported, is not just as legislators, but also as parents of teenage children.
All of us have kids that are growing up in this society right now, and we're all very
proud of what they're doing, but we are also concerned about things outside our control,
the confines of our home that can be problematic, and that's why we're going to really focus
on looking at legislation, pertaining to social media, you know, always tell people, you
know, one of the greatest things ever invented was internet and also social platforms that
that followed have been puts us in touch
and gives you instantaneous information,
which can be a wonderful, wonderful tool.
But it also in the wrong hands can be a very dangerous tool.
It can be one that can cause a lot of harm,
almost as an invisible enemy of yours.
And you have so many bad actors right now
who are targeting our children
And you're seeing it in mental health situations
as well as cyber bully in this going on
around the country right now.
And we're wanting to take that head on.
We want to take that initiative head on.
You're going to always have to be trying to adapt
with what's going on in society.
And we feel like making this a priority,
just like we've done with other things
pertaining to children here in the state-grade state of Georgia.
But we want to be at the forefront of protecting them and the legislation that we're putting
forward this session that our Senator Havittari is going to be carrying for us does just
that.
And we're going to model this after other states, there's plenty of other states who have
pioneered this program to try to address a lot of these issues.
There's some that have gotten it wrong and they're in litigation right now, but there's
others have done very well with it, and that's who we're going to be focused on this
upcoming session, and I think it's important enough to have a press conference about
something like this, because if we can't, as legislators, as parents, if we can't protect
the ones we love the most and the future of our society, then, you know, we're in the
wrong business, as public servants, and they need to be first and foremost.
So I want to yield the podium to our leader here
and our author of the bill, Jason Apertori.
Thank you.
I want to thank the lieutenant governor
for his leadership on this issue.
I think right now in society, we have a lot of issues going
on in terms of cyberbullying and dealing
with social media content across George
and across the country, especially
with our younger kids.
So I have three kids.
In elementary, all the way up to high school.
of a wife that's a high school teacher,
and I'll tell you, this is always the number one issue
that she comes home to me about every single day.
So I think it's important that we empower parents,
I think a lot of parents don't know how to restrict content
sometimes, even though they're doing their best,
checking devices, and seeing who's texting who,
and who's on Instagram, but the problem gets really prevalent
when we get into the classroom,
and we have students that are on their phones
on their laptops, you know, a little bit distracted,
but at the same time, looking at content maybe
that is not helpful to them and their family.
So this legislation, when we introduce it,
is going to be modeled after some similar states,
like Louisiana, there are some bad examples out there
that we won't be copying, because we do want to be sensitive
to the First Amendment protection for citizens
across this state, we're not going to be regulating screen time,
We're not going to be regulating those types of things.
I think that is up to the parent or guardian of each child
in the state of Georgia.
But at the end of the day, when it comes to cyber bullying
and empowering parents, our school leaders, our teachers
who are kind of handcuffed with what's going on
with social media in their classroom while they're teaching,
we want to make sure that people have the resources,
they're educated, but we're also making a stand here in Georgia
that something's got to change as the world evolves,
whether it's with technology, AI, whatever you want to call it,
as we continue our leading here in Georgia.
So I want to thank the Lieutenant Governor
for making this one of his priorities
for the upcoming session and appreciate it.
Thank you.
And Senator Dimitian, one of the key points
that I left out there is this is a mission
that we're going to be partnering with our school systems,
partnering with our parents home,
because our teachers and administrators are on their own
the front lines when it comes to this issue
and they're going to need the necessary resources
to help prevent combat and also monitor these things moving
forward.
So I'm happy to take any questions.
I think we had a list of questions, are you new?
OK, yes, ma'am.
Is this the first time you need a session
in the background so far, and what's going to happen?
Our plan is to reach out to them and actually partner
with the likes of Google and look at, you know,
Microsoft, so we are going to partner with them
as we're crafting the legislation finalizing it
to look for ideas, you know, on what's the best practices
and things of that nature.
So it's a very good question and it's something
that we're going to be doing.
School districts, you know, obviously, yeah.
I mean, obviously we will be partnering
was looking, talking to superintendents and asking about what kind of resources is actually
what they're seeing on the ground inside there.
The walls of their respective school system, so yeah, we want to have their involvement
as well.
So, yes, sir.
Yeah, so I think right now it's in development, but I think there are some tenants and
I think in terms of the bill that we do believe should be in it, such as age verification.
I think we want to make sure that we're touching on the, you know, those decision points
where parents can be engaged, as they look at content or about to look at content.
And again, you know, we're focused on minors, we're focusing folks kind of in a 12k, 12
age bracket, you know, so under 18, under 19, and, you know, once you kind of graduate
out of that age, then, you know, the rules don't apply, but I think just empowering parents
to know what's going on in their kids' life every single day,
keep them safe from predators.
One last question.
I mean, there's going to be teeth within the legislation
and in and of itself.
That's not going to be limited to a school district.
But there is going to be, it's going to have teeth in it,
where the people perpetrating these things will be,
we're gonna try to hold them accountable for, you know.
And what's that one?
Rome.
Yeah, we all go off topic then.
I'm happy to ask you.
Is there a long-forced reinforcement to this
and the small enforcement in the schools out there?
Well, yeah, that's why we're gonna engage
or our local superintendent to look at what kind of resources
they would need when we finalize this
and try to implement it on a broader scale.
So that'll be part of the discussion as well.
Well, thank you, everybody.
We're going to send out a press release after this
and then give an email to us and we'll see you next time.
I'm on that conversation.
All right, thank you all.
Appreciate it.
