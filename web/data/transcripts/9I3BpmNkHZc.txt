Representative Franklin is recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Okay, thank you. So my original House Bill was stripped into Senate via a floor amendment and replaced with an investment measure and a bill to increase legislative retirement pay. What we've done here is amend the Senate amendment and replace the language with three important wildlife measures that were vetted and passed by our House Committee on Game, Fish, Parks and Overwembley Support, supported in the House floor. The first amendment updates the effective date of the Code section dealing with the hunting with air guns by extending a scheduled sunset to 2028. Second, the amendment makes the color fluorescent pink and acceptable color that can be worn while deer hunting. Third, the amendment updates language relating to catching catfish with a bow and air in Georgia rivers and lakes. My colleagues, I ask for you. Once again, give your favorable consideration to these three simple measures. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, will you yield for a couple of questions? Yes, sir. I'll yield. Let's see, to your right, Chairman Meeks is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Manoeu. I yield. On Section 5, line 60, you strike, can't, uh, channel catfish and flathead. Can you explain the difference between those two species? I'll tell you what. I can't, but I'd like to imagine anybody that hunts these things and suits them, they will get, they can. But thank you for that observation. Yes, sir catfish. Um, Representative Frye to your left. Representative Spencer Frye has recognized for a question. Mr. General Manoeu. I yield. In a true that I cannot wait to change all my hunt and gear from orange, which is the color I hate, to bright paint, which is way more acceptable being from Athens. Absolutely.

So is it required for duty to have a utility for certain rental agreements? Representative Carpenter is recognized to explain the House's agreement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I come before you today with a very important piece of legislation that this body passed out last year. There may have been one no vote, but I think it was pretty close to unanimous. For the first time in Georgia code, we're going to put fit for human habitation for the rights of tenants across the state. It's an important issue brought to light with the AJC and the dangerous dwellings and really important piece of legislation that our speaker and majority leader, frustration helped move through the House, got it over to the Senate last year, politics or politics. But today we're here to vote on a substitute that made a big change to it and added a year because they held it a year. So I appreciate your favorable consideration on it. Gentlemen, you yield for a question. This would be a good one. Yes, sir. Representative Yasmin Neal to your left is recognized for a question. Whoa, why don't they even look at it? Why are you going to crick at my neck? Doesn't do them in yield. Yes, ma'am. It's not true that I worked on this bill and conjunction with the Speaker of the House. And I want to say thank you so much for the work that we were able to do together. And I'm so glad to see it back. I urge our colleagues to say yes. Thank you for your work on this legislation as well. And it's a great piece of legislation for all Georgians.

Mr. Chairman, is this the safe at home act that you work so diligently on? And any numbers of members, including Representative Gil, are so important to George and all over this state? Yes, sir. No doubt about it. I mean, we always try to say George is the best place to work and play, but sometimes for some folks it's not the best place to live. And so this legislation will move that ball forward so we can protect Georgia renters. And I appreciate your help on this legislation. Thank you for your persistence, Mr. Chairman. All in the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 404. All those in favor of yes, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.

The nay is won. The House has agreed to the Senate's substitute. Congratulations, House. Thank you for your work on this important piece of legislation. Give yourselves a hand. Chairman Chuck Martin has recognized for a motion. Yes, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agree to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 1267. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1267 to be entitled to amend Title 50 of the EF to the Georgia Ancestor relating state government so as to repeal chapter 13A relating to tax strike unions. Representative Martin has recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Members of the House, we voted this on the 27th, I believe, of February with a unanimous vote. This is the enabling legislation to move the tax tribunal from the executive branch into the judicial branch. The Senate helped us out and made some clarifying language in judiciary would be wrong for the Senate Judiciary Committee to not be able to help us out a bit with that. It just accomplished what we did on February 20th. So if I'd stand for any questions, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, how's no questions? I yield the well-nast for the House's favorable consideration. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1267. All those in favor of vote, yes, those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Now, all members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the motion, you agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1267. The yeas are 170, nays or zero, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 1267. Chair Lady Dimfsy's recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I make a motion to agree to the Senate's substitute to HB 1344 as amended by the Senate. Mr. Clerk, will you read the cap? House Bill 1344 to be entitled to amend Article 1 and Chapter 2, Title 37, and the EFISCO to Georgia annotated relating the general provisions relevant to the administration of mental health. Representative Dimfsy's recognized to explain the importance of the motion. Representative Dimfsy's recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. This is a bill that we pass for the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. The simple changes that were made are on page 3 of the bill, line 44, and 34. It simply added the chairperson of the State Board of Partents and Parolees to the list of members that are able to have someone be in their place when they cannot be there for board meetings. Lady Hasn't had questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. I yielded the well on the ladies' motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1344. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed. Will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? For what purpose is representative Holly rise? No, he weighs. He weighs.

All in the ladies' motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1344, the yeas are 165, the nays are two, the House agreed to the Senate's substitute. Okay, members, if you're close to your seats, I would appreciate it if you assume your seats in the House. We have a very special afternoon order. If there are members in the any room that may need to come back into the chamber, now would be the appropriate time. We all are aware that we have members of this body and members of our family that we will not be returning. And we've heard from several members that will be doing just that over the last few weeks in the last month. And I have one today that we're going to recognize. So he can come to the well, tell us about some memories, and talk to us about the future. With that, I'm going to recognize the minority leader of this House representing James Barberley. That's the leader. Thank you to Speaker. Representative, I want to thank you for your service to this state. I met your family. I know you're going to introduce them. I want to thank you for that service. Thank you for your dedication to Georgia. A number of years you've been here representing the folks down in Bibb County. And your service is not going noted. You've made a difference. And I'm personally proud to call your friend. And thank you for your service to this state and for the betterment of our citizens. Representative Barberley. Thanks for the speaker. In life, you've got to have a wingman, and y'all don't realize it, but the speaker is my wingman. And every once in a while, he told me years ago when we were fighting when he was a leader of Chuck. We were fighting over some bills trying to get through the House on crossover. And we got 12 bills passed on one day. And me and him, you guys can't even imagine the long nights we had. And afterwards, he said to me, you know, I know how you fight when you're sober. And I said, what? I know how you fight when you, okay, never mind that. I'll stop. He is a good man and a dear friend, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. I didn't have time to prepare remarks. I mean, this is a craziest thing. I'm here today, and I'm sort of overwhelmed by sadness. I did not see that coming. For a better part of a year, I have contemplated what I've done in this House, where we are as a state of Georgia, and what this is a future look like. And in that space, what I can say to y'all without a doubt is I laid it all on the line. And I was sad. I know within myself that I was faithful to the little things. And so I suspect that God had me do something else. What you don't know, and I want to share just a few things from the last few days, as you guys know, many of you may or may not know, I'm originally from Baltimore, Maryland. So today, around four o'clock this morning, the Francis Scott Key Bridge came down. I've been across that bridge. We've been across that bridge numerous times. The only way you can sort of get in the Baltimore from the airport is Scott Key, or you got to go on to the Harbottunnel. Neither one of them are fun, but the date of bridge came down. And so for those people who lost their lives and still looking for stuff, thank God, no one in my family was there. But it was a tremendous harrowing day. So to the Folk in Baltimore, we're praying for you here in Georgia. Y'all don't have to stand up. The last few days, the reason why I hadn't prepared any remarks, I'm going to tell you about what happened. And this is not to tell you this in a morbid sense. It's just the reality of where I am. On Thursday, I got a call from my mom, and she told me I need to get to Raleigh, North Carolina, because my cousin was turned in about 60 years old and he wanted me to come. And so I said, my mom, I'm writing a middle of session. I can't come. She said, well, he has prostate cancer. And he's going to tell the family about what's going on. So y'all know how we jump, we lean right into it, we get up there, and I get up there. And he's going through what he's got to go through, and we'll know that as a family soon enough, how he's going to prevail. But what you don't know is about six weeks ago, one of my dear friends was diagnosed with lung cancer. And she is a very dear dear friend of mine. Yesterday, today is Tuesday, right? Yesterday I was in a hospital from 4.30 in the morning to 11 o'clock last night with her family, because I have a particular skill set around the nomenclature of disease that I could lend to her family to help them make sense out of her having the lower third of her left lung removed. I might say that in a more of a sense, because every last one of us in this house has made a tremendous sacrifice. And to those around us, we've all been through something. And that's why we are members, and that's why we are family. And it is not lost on me the toll that it takes on every last one of us to serve in this capacity, to serve our districts the best we can. Trying to make, trying to form a more perfect union. In 2011, I came in a special election, I sat right over there. It was better than the D block tray, it was A block buddy. And I sat right there right where you are Suhong. And I was the only, where Sam, where Sam? I was the only Democrat that sat in that area, and if y'all don't know it, my he was a little bit different than everybody over there mostly. I was the only bright spot in the sea of Republicans. And Sam was my seatmate Jason Shaw, Amy Carter. And I got frustrated one day, I said, man, I've got to get some more Democrats over here, you know. And we had just changed the rules, Mr. Speaker, where you had to have a caucus to go out to down a before that in a couple years you could like people take out the number now you need a caucus. It was a foolishness. So Sam looks at me, I look at him, and we should start on caucus and we should call it that. I was like, let's call it the zebra caucus. I'm the only striped one in zebra. And that lasted for four or five years. And then Sam got in the well and Jason, Jason said, Jason says, y'all remember the cattle bill, right? But nobody can forget that bill. And Jason gets Sam gets in the well and he said, Bev, you know, he has his black angus. I said, black angus, what is that? Look, there's big old cows around. I said, man, I'm going to ask him a question. So we're encouraging everybody's over there laughing fooling around, which they're still doing. A block has not changed. Y'all guys calm down. Okay, you know, especially you buddy, really where is really a, never mind. You guys, that A block is always crazy, but Sam gets in the well. And Sam, I say Sam, what's the difference between like a regular cow and black angus? He said, Bev, once you go black, you never go back. And this place went bananas. And that began a long, a long time over there. I think the only person left over there is Corbin. And in 12 years, the only person left is Corbin. And he's my brother from another mother. Good to see you, bro. Now, let me talk a little bit about where we are, where I am, and then sort of where we'll go from here, where I go from here. There's one thing that no one in this room will be able to do for as long as you live. You've never been able to do it. You won't be able to do it today. And I guarantee you, you won't be able to do it tomorrow. Anyone know what that is? Someone, no one. Okay, small crowd, thanks. What you will never be able to do, no matter how hard you try, is see your own face. Never. So you have to rely on people around you to help you to see who you are in space and time, because you'll never, ever, ever be able to see your own face. Just a reflection. And your reflection can come off a two or three or four different medium. Y'all know how my eye doctor's. I can talk about this all day, but I won't. But the three or four reflections that I get to see all the time is the four folk who sit up here with me today. The first one is my former wife, Michelle Prettyman. And Michelle just wave, because I don't know you. Thank you. No. Allen Billy is like, how you messed that up? I said, y'all know me. Yeah, that makes sense. But Michelle said to me, maybe about six or seven months ago, she said, how are you doing? I said, I'm doing all right. She lives in New York. She's a professor at Fordham African American Studies. She's a big time professor in the whole film, stuff. She was in South Africa, something like this. Of course, she's doing wonderful things. But she said, how are you doing? I said, I'm guessing I'm doing all right. She said, you still want to do this? And I couldn't come up with a why? Like, why are you continuing to do this? And I said, well, just talk to me straight. What do you think? She said, it might be time for you to come home. Then my kids started. Hey, dad, how you doing? Micah, raise your hand. Micah finished more house a few years back. He lived with me doing COVID. So when we came home, he had to live with me for a year in COVID. Now, let me tell you something about raising a man from more house. You got to raise a man. And I would say, hey, Micah, it's time to wash the dishes. Look, there you go. Y'all know the ones, and Roger Bruce. He would never wash the dishes until I had to, you know, but it's fine. He's now a man. He works at Metta. My daughter, Maya, graduated from NYU. Maya raised your hand. Maya is a ceramicist, whatever it is. So she's just artist, and she has shows. And we went to New Mexico last year. She sold a trinket for like $5,000. I was like, what? What am I doing with my life, Mrs. Bigger? And he's a talented kid. And then my son, Jacob, he graduated from Temple two years ago. And, yeah. He's a good man. He graduated day after he graduated. He got a $9,000 scholarship. What? So Michelle and I were like, well, you know that's our money. He was like, hey, dad. You know, I got to still pay for rent. I was like, that's your money. And so he's a very wise smart kid, and I love him. What y'all don't know is when they were growing up, I would go to the eye doctor office to my practice. And every Saturday, we would have Dr. Beverly's lesson for the kiddies. And he reminded me of that just a few days ago. And he said to me something that was very profound, which I never would have thought he would say this about me, or my kids would think this about me, because I'm just being a dad. He said, dad, you have lived your life in a way that sometimes when I get in trouble, I ask myself what would my dad do? And it makes me go in a direction where I'm following my true North. And that's profound. So thank you, Jacob. With my family, y'all have become my extended family. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't change it. I can't rearrange it. It is what it is. And I am grateful. So deeply grateful to each and every one of you. So what I want to do is I was going to try to name everybody who has impacted me. We would be here until tomorrow. And so Mr. Riley, I'm going to ask you to do a, no, I'm just kidding. Do a row call. No, here's what I want you to do. I want you to think for just a moment. If you have impacted my life, and I'm going to go through a couple categories, just if you've impacted my life, just acknowledge in yourself, I know I've impacted them. Now this is for my friends and my enemies alike, right? And this enemy is political. So it's not a really long term, I hope. But it's friends and enemies. So if you've impacted my life, I want you to acknowledge this. First group, I want to have yourself acknowledges black women. So if any black woman in here, everyone, that you've impacted my life, just like, yeah, be me. Okay. Next black men. Okay. Democrat. Democrat. I'm going to start with Democrats because that's the superior. Okay, just, just, okay. So Democrats. All right. White women. All right. White WMDs. Y'all know what WMDs are? Oh, man. White male Democrats. I come to WMRs in just a second. But the WMDs, Mr. Speaker, now y'all got to do some about this, Jerry Mandry, man, because I'm now, the Democratic Party is now left with two WMDs. Y'all take care of my people, please. Okay. Right. The Asian Latinx. Again, if you've impacted my life, please acknowledge that in your soul. For those who don't know if you've impacted my life, you might not have, because I haven't spent that much time with you yet, but it's coming. And then on the Republican side, same thing. Black women. White women. White men. Asian Latinx. Now, there's another category I'm going to come up with right now in the spot. Those who don't know what you are, that's fine too. Because if you don't know that impacted, do you impacted me? You have. Trust me. You have. I'm grateful, deeply grateful. Now, for those in the audience who have impacted me, the question I have to you is have I impacted you as well. And if I have those people who said, yeah, there's an impact you had on me, I want you all to stand up. Stand up. Stand up. Right now. Stand up. Now, it's not a secret vote, ow, it's not a secret vote. It's not a secret vote. Okay. Joel are my family. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. And Joel can't change it. You can't rearrange it. It is. What it is. Joel, sit down. Collectively, we represent Georgia. And I am profoundly grateful that I have an extended family beyond the ones who allow me to serve for a dozen years. So on and y'all, I salute y'all today. I am glad to be gone. But it's coupled with a profound sadness because I leave y'all my extended family. So, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to you again for being my friend. And to the folk who are in this room, I am profoundly grateful. We will make Georgia a more perfect union soon enough. I love you, God, guys. And with that, I yield a well. Thank you, Speaker. Thank you. Mr. Leader, if you would join me just for a second, you know I don't like to take pictures. You know, one of the things we share with each other is this family. But one of the other things that I've found and many of you have found is you've traveled around this state to visit with members in their communities. For me, that's what it's about as my community. And you can view that from the larger sense of our country and our state. But the people we represent. And the knowledge about those folks, the knowledge about their issues. And the vision you have to solve those issues. I've had to privilege to be in James's community. And to understand and listen to him and know that he understands he cares very deeply about the issues in his community. But also, he cares very deeply about the issues across our state. For me, that's the measure of a person. They understand and are willing to look deeply and honestly into the issues of impact that people they care about. They're neighbors. And I just want to thank Leader James Beverly for his caring for his neighbors. For his desire to make their lives better. And I will just tell you, I think you have. Thank you, Your Service to Georgia. We look forward to the remainder of the day. And day 40. And certainly, to your service for the remainder of your term. Thank you, Your Service. Thank you for your friendship. We're going to carry on with the work of this day. Thank you. You can come down and we'll agree to the leader for a few minutes. And then we'll get started up here again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you around this was another representative's bill we put into this one a lot of jurisdictions around are having problems with someone who goes to the jail to turn themselves in for a charge and they're having a radio and get personnel off of the the patrol to come and take these folks into custody. This just simply gives jailers the ability to do that they can also take someone into custody who has violated a law who has already in jail so it really helps our public safety and Mr. Speaker that's all the bill does a good piece of legislation that we have changed since it came over from the Senate. I'd ask for the body's favorable consideration if there are no questions I'll be happy to yield the will. Gentlemen has a question to your left if you're yield yes I will. Rimsine Park Cannon has a question for you. Representative Cannon. Thank you Mr. Speaker do you yield? I do. Thank you. On section two the lines 27 it says it shall be unlawful but what's the penalty? What's the? Well most of these situations where you're dealing with someone who is running up a blue light or a red light or an orange light and it's in violation of the code section the Department of Public Safety is the one that deals with that. Okay do you further yield? I sure do. Can you clarify what would be the penalty for doing this unlawful act? I would assume that the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety would take a look at a complaint if it was filed by an individual or by another agency or by a group of people and take the appropriate action he deems necessary to facilitate remedying the situation. Okay into you further yield. Yes ma'am. And for the section three with the jailers having additional arrest powers who do those arrest powers currently live with? Well currently you have jailers who are post certified and they are inside the jail. This just allows post to allow those folks to take those people into custody and you know it's just a post certification that's going to be changed to allow for that. And it's inside the guard line too so these jailers are not out patrolling. These are just people that are working in our jail throughout the state. Okay do you further yield to clarify? Yes ma'am. So you're saying that this provision is necessary because why? Well I'm trying to get some clarity here on who the power is currently with. This particular section of the bill is necessary because currently right now jailers cannot initiate an arrest. So if you have a jailer who has been to school they've got training and they're working inside a jail they're working the counter at the jail. So if someone comes in and says hey I have an arrest warrant out for me right now and I want to turn myself in. Well that jailer is responsible for looking after those prisoners in the jail system. They cannot initiate an arrest now. So what this will do will allow them the power to do that. Thank you for the clarity. So who does the arrest power currently live with? Is that the sheriff or? That's the sheriff's and the deputies. That's the question. Thank you for answering. These people are still deputies. They're just jailers. Thank you. Yes, gentlemen has another question left. I think will be helpful. Yes. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith is recognized for a question. To my friend from City of Galby, you'll for question. To my friend from Harrelson County I most certainly do. Thank you sir. Is it not true that the official code of Georgia has default provisions for fines and sentencing for both misdemeanors and felonies in this state? I believe the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Thank you. Representative Gullett who sits right behind you I think has a question if the gentleman will yield. Jim and yield to my friend from Pauling County. Thank you Chairman. It's going to say thank you for this bill. Is it not true that not only is my county asked for this one of my one of my jail administrators as far as the jailing arrest powers is so important to our communities but especially important to the smaller communities throughout the state. In my county of about 185,000 people is not true that we have only four deputies at a given time in a jail and so when things arise inside the jail or things people turn surrendered themselves to the jail deputies are called from off the street oftentimes to handle the situations is not true. As usual the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Thank you for the bill. Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will yield the well and ask the body's favorable consideration to the updated version of Senate Bill 37. Gentlemen is yielded the well. Thanks for the explanation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair here's none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none and the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. We have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 37. Yeas are 161 the nasor 2 this bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 417 417. Senate bill 417 by Senator Albers the 56 Roberts and the 29th and others to be in top of an act to amend code section 8 to 106 of the Fisher go to Georgia and it's added relating the reporting of accidents relative to elevators, dumbwaters, escalators and man lives. This bill haven't been referred to the committee on public safety and Homeland Security that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Baldwin County representing Ken Vance is recognized to present the bill or represent advance. Thank you Mr. Speaker and fellow representatives. I come to you today with Senate bill 417 and what it does very briefly is requires reports of accidents on elevators, escalators.

moving sidewalks and so forth to be filed by the end of the next business day. The bill also creates a new misdemeanor for detonating fire works within 150 feet of an emergency medical technician, firefighter or law enforcement officer when detonation is for the purpose of hindering or disrupting that first responder's duties. It also revises the licensing requirements relating to the display of fireworks and pyrotechnics and a license for the use of certain specific effects in production of a motion picture or television production. And it also prohibits certain fire propelled devices. The legislation revises finally the inspection and certification requirements relative to borders and pressure vessels and it allows for the dissemination of certain information related to the hazardous chemicals in written or electronic form to public employees. This bill is really initiated in the is an agency bill from the insurance commissioner and Mr. Speaker if there are no questions, the insurance commissioner John King and I would really appreciate your favorable support of this bill. Gentlemen, you yield. Yes, sir. Mr. Jasmine Clark to your left. Representative Clark has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, you? Yes, ma'am. So I know you said that this bill does talk about fireworks displays like public fireworks displays. A lot of the people in my district are really concerned about people doing what looks almost like professional fireworks, but in their yards and it's causing fires and things like that. Does this bill contemplate anything about that? Yes, ma'am, it does. What what it does is it will actually give law enforcement a little, a little more leverage if you will to stop those kinds of things because you know and I know that the power techniques that are being created today and sold on the street are much more elaborate than the firecrackers you and I had as a kid. Thank you for your question. Thank you so much for the bill. Yes, ma'am. Representative Bernal to your left. It's a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman, you? Yes, ma'am. My question is along that same line because we have people who are putting having fireworks shows in our neighborhood. And so the one thing that I find that's a problem is that the smoke is so heavy that you can't even see the house where it is. So based on timing and documentation, if we know say the next day because the police officers not going to really see if they come in there, can we still report it then? Yes, ma'am. I think this bill does address the issue that you're talking about with the smoke and the noise and everything else. Yes, ma'am. I think it does. Thank you. You're welcome. Representative Hagen to your right has a question. The gentleman will yield. Do you yield? Yes, ma'am. This may be a question for those of us who live in rural areas. And I'm sorry for having not been able to get through this more quickly. But does this bill address any of us who may live in rural parts of the state who like to set off fireworks? Are homes not in a neighborhood? Could you address that? You mean an individual shooting fireworks at their house in the country? Yes, exactly. I think this bill does contain that common sense measure that treats something like you're talking about in a little more common sense way than it would be in downtown Atlanta and in a subdivision. Understood. Thank you very much. Well. I yield. Well, you had no further questions. The gentleman is yielded well. Thank you. Well, you did have one question. I'm sorry, but you're yielded well. Now, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's done the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's done the report. The committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of Senate bill 417. The yeas are 157. The nay is two. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 358358? Senate bill 358 by Senator Burns, the 23rd, go to the 51st, Robertson, the 29th, and others. We can title them back to them in sub part one of our part one of Article 2 and Chapter 2 of Title 21. The official go to Georgia and I'll tell you really in the state election board so as to remove the Secretary of State from the board. This bill I'm referring to the committee on government affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chairman Levert has recognized to present the bill. Chairman Levert. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for waiting. Ladies and gentlemen, House, I'm asking your favor for support for Senate bill 358. Despite the title of this bill no longer deals with elections, but instead is a department bill for the Ethics Commission. It makes some changes to filing deadlines and schedules for reports within the jurisdiction of the Ethics Commission, which, as you know, was formally the government transparency and campaign finance commission. So what the bill will do, not this year, but next year is it will standardize reporting dates for every single candidate, office holder, and incumbent in the state. All reporting dates will be the same for every office every year. January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 15. Local filers, county commissioners, city council members, board of education members will continue to file locally until through December 31, 2025. And then they will start filing disclosure reports with commission. The reason for this is some of the local filing officers have been giving wrong advice and information to candidates. They also are not turning in the candidates who are late. And so it's sort of creating two different systems and we're trying to make that more uniform. An important issue to some of your local officials into this GMA was that local filers still have the exemption or modified filing requirements that they follow the notice that they're not going to raise or spend more than $25,000. And if it's $25,000 and if it goes from $2500 to $5, there's a modified filing requirement. We're also putting packs on the same schedule and they now have to have a separate bank account like candidates do. And also we're trying to make the schedule for failed candidates and office holders to be the same. That January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 15. Currently there's some different requirements depending on whether you retire or run and don't win and we're trying to just make everything more uniform so it's easy for the commission. And it's also easier for the public to keep up with and find the reports that have the relevant information. Personal financial disclosure statements also will be due at the same time every year April 1, no more 15 days after qualifying or by July 1. So there's one day to remember every year for your personal financial disclosure statement. Statewide constitutional officers have a personal financial disclosure statement that will change somewhat because it will give a little more detail about ranges of various investments. And finally for lobbyists, we're also trying to make their filing more uniform. Right now there's different filing frequencies depending upon what kind of lobbyists you are and what entity you lobby. We're just making it now they have to file a monthly report. So we think this will make it easier for us, easy for the lobbyists, easy for everybody including the public in trying to access this information. You know, it will not take effect until next year. So don't think it will apply this year but we think it will just make the information a lot more accessible to everybody. So that is the bill Mr. Speaker and I will give you for questions. Gentlemen has no questions. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, I would ask your favor consideration of Senate Bill 358. Gentlemen, as usual, the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's done the previous questions ordered.

Committee names to repeal provisions relating to inactive board, spannels, authorities, centers and commissions. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Governor LaFaire's that committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee sub. Representative Hilton is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of this August body, I'm here to present to you Senate Bill 341. The crux of this bill is Senate Bill 23 that we passed the House and the Senate last year. It came up just a bit short as the governor actually vetoed it. That section he vetoed is not in this bill. This bill removes old boards and commissions that are no longer active or in place. The second component of this bill removes pre-filing and we talked a little bit about that last year. And then the third component of the bill makes administrative changes to the legislative services committee. And so that with that Mr. Speaker I'll stand for any questions. Gentlemen has a question if you'll yield for ripped in an eloance to your left. I think you know where she sits. Thank you, does the gentleman yield? Yes I do. I just wanted to clarify does this legislation change anything about the maximums that can be contributed to a candidate in a county or municipal campaign. That's a question that I got from somebody back at home. I don't believe it does now. I didn't think. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I want to clarify. Clarify. Clarify. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You'll the well. Gentlemen, yield of the well is an objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered.

The title of the act to amend chapter 19 and the title of 45, the fish go to Georgia and Tederling. The labor practices relative to public. Officers and employees, those who survive for the development administration of the state of Georgia as a model employer program is bill 11 for the committee on industry and labor. That committee recommends that that bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Gentlemen from down in Bullock County, representing Lehman Franklin is recognized to present the bill representing Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I want to take a moment before presenting this. It's a mention that Charlie Miller, a lot of you know him. He's been working on this for a couple of years now. If you don't know him, those of you that do know him, know he's a man of great character. His father was Butch Miller, which was a car dealer with me and I've known him for many years. So it's really an honor for me to be able to present this to you today. But the way this came about was it was a result of a Senate workforce study committee from last year. And they were digging into how they could create more of a workforce environment for Georgia and what they discovered was according to the Georgia Council on developmental disabilities. Georgia has close to close or over 150,000 working age men and women with disabilities and out of that number only 20,000 are currently working. So what this bill does is an effort to utilize that workforce to be able to allow them to come back to work. And it's supported what the bill does is it support state agencies through gain. The Georgia as a model employee program to utilize this town of the pool by giving them the resources to recruit higher train and retain these qualified individuals. And this will be implemented and developed by the state ADA coordinator. And office has that is already in existence. So it won't be creating a new one. By requiring them to submit a report on or before September of each year outlining data on training accommodation and assistance recruiting and retention. And through this report we will utilize the best practices to help more of these individuals to be able to join the workforce. So this is a great bill. It's one you can really get behind and feel good about voting at Yasson and Mr. Speaker, there's no further questions. You're the well. Yes, you have a couple of questions. Representative Cannon to your left has a question. Representative Park Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you I do thank you. I want to show my respect to those living with visible and invisible disabilities, but to ask about line 31, which speaks to reasonable accommodations. I know there has been a long term effort in this house to address reasonable accommodations for pregnant people. And I was wondering if this bill will support those individuals as well. I'm not understanding it does not. It's only so it does not. From understanding it's not the pregnancy people. It's just ones of disabilities. Thank you. And do you further yields? I do. On line 34 speaks to the state ADA coordinator in which office are they located and is that office a funded office of the state of Georgia? Yes, it's all this is already in existence and it's let me look it up for you. It is. I didn't I can't tell you the answer with you. I don't know. I don't know how to ask for that. Just the question was whether it was state funded or federal funded. Thank you. Gentlemen, further yield. Yes, sir. I do. Representing Holly to your left in the back has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you I do? I do. Is it not true that this bill it actually will help augment the state's workforce that oftentimes we're having to look at the severe competition that we have. We're literally because of there's a lack of talent pool. We have many workers who actually traveling outside of the state into Georgia. But it's always good and we can be able to have a workforce has developed from our own locals and especially those who are able to transition from the development he disabled into the workforce. Is that not true? That is true. And you know, it's amazing that this bill hasn't been enacted before now. So I appreciate your support. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the will. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered.

Representative Yasmin Neill is recognized to present the bill. Representative Neill. Thank you to the speaker. Thank you to this body. Today I bring you Senate Bill 10. Senate Bill 10 essentially adds reckless stunt driving to the already preexisting drag racing code section of this body passed prior. This edition covers all stunt driving, laying drags and more that go beyond the typical drag racing we are familiar with. It also adds clarification to the code to protect those people who are not involved by adding present and actively participating, so not to unintentionally penalize, pass or pass or people who are not associated with these acts. The goal is to go out to people actually working and running said drag racing events and not innocent by standards. So, Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and if I have no questions, I'll yield. The lady has no questions. Thank you. I ask you a favor consideration. Good job explaining the bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

This bill, having referred to the Committee on Judiciary, that committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee's substitute. Representative Madreaves is recognized to present the bill. Representative Reaves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I present to you the nonprofit and charitable donor privacy bill. This was sponsored in the Senate by President Pro Tem, John F. Kennedy. There was a somewhat similar House bill that went before the governmental affairs committee. And when the Senate bill passed before crossover day, we worked off the Senate bill. Judiciary Committee heard it. Heard the Senate bill. It implements two United States Supreme Court opinions, one, N. double ACP versus Alabama in the 1950s. It said states, keep your hands off of nonprofit donor lists. The second is a more recent case, the Bonta case in 2021. You've got a handout in front of you that has the nonprofit and charitable groups from all around the country who supported as friend of the court briefs in that Bonta case in 2021. This supports protection for charitable donors. It says the Georgia governmental entities do not collect or publicize nonprofit donor lists with a few exceptions. And those few exceptions are campaign finance, any criminal investigations or court subpoenas or discovery. Multiple state agencies had input in the bill. They are listed in the bill. The philanthropy round table is the nonprofit donor rights group who requested the bill. Last week, you approved a bill from them that representative Kelly presented concerning donor intent. Donors nationally and in Georgia look to things like this to see if their privacy will be protected when they give to a nonprofit entities. This will actually promote more donations to Georgia nonprofits in this age of cancel culture where a lot of people want to give anonymously. Non-profit giving helps those in need.

Professor the ultimate beneficiaries of nonprofit funds, whether it's education, housing, homelessness, helping the needy. Let's give people a hand up by supporting protections for nonprofit charitable givers. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I yield the well and request favorable consideration. Gentlemen, has a question or two? Feel yield? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The whip park has a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. gentlemen, yield? Yes. So, can you provide some clarification to me as to whether or not the exemption also applies to donations to leadership committees? Any political committee that under federal law or state law is required to disclose their contributions, this bill would not abrogate that at all. So, thank you for the clarification. Does this essentially provide nonprofits the ability to disclose and not disclose? Absolutely. Both the donors and the nonprofits can voluntarily disclose what this bill does, it's limited to the government. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, I yield the well. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you. He's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none of the report the committee is agreed to.

Senate Bill 354 by Senator Walker, the 20th, the 17th, her Patrick, the 32nd and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 10, the Title 43 of the Fisher go to Georgia and Tater League, and the cosmetologist and barber, so it's exempt from licensure persons performing certain limited responsibilities. This bill haven't referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries. That committee recommends this bill do pass by Rules Committee substitute. Representative Jeanne Earhart has recognized to present the bill. Representative Earhart. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored today to bring you a great job creating bill for your consideration. A bill that will create jobs for Georgians and that props to sort of further enhance and grow our economy. It provides for very narrowly defined exceptions to licensure for certain actions within the cosmetology practice, those being blow-drying of hair and the applying of makeup. Two practices that are currently allowed in Georgia, in code and allowed without a license for those that are working in both the film industry or who are engaging in these practices in retail establishments. For those of my female colleagues that have ever been in an Ulta or a Macy's to the Cosmetics counter, you'll know what I'm talking about. SB 354 will create more jobs and opportunities in our state, especially for lower income workers. Many of these workers are entrepreneurial women who do not have the time and resources to go to school. Other states that have been acted similar reforms have seen economic growth, including more women-owned businesses like blow-dry bars and bridal hair and makeup businesses. SB 354 provides important reform that will help people get to work faster and incur less debt. Research shows that the average cost to attend cosmetology school in Georgia is nearly $18,000. Our cosmetology licensing laws force many aspiring artists to take on student loan debt that they struggle to then pay back. This educational investment may make sense for those who want to cut and color hair or work with chemicals. It does not make sense for people who simply want to blow dry hair or apply makeup. Research has shown that some of the greatest occupational licensing burdens for lower income workers in Georgia affect those in the beauty industry. It takes 1,500 hours to work as a cosmetologist, but only 150 hours to work as an EMT. These kinds of heavy licensing burdens do not make sense for people who only wish to style hair and apply makeup. Folks, this is an important reform, a good for business reform, and I ask for your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill, and I'm happy to yield to any questions. Lady has a couple of questions. Representative Park, can you answer your left? Has a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes. Good name, 1 or 2, communicable diseases that could happen based on this deregulation. Right. I'm not aware of any, but I know that certainly certain cosmetic and beauty practices that involve putting chemicals on the skin, cutting the skin, things like threading and things of that nature, none of those things which are included in this bill. I know that there is an enhanced potential for harm that could come from communicable diseases in those. These are considered low risk activities. Okay, do you further yield? Yes. So we just talked about hair, I'm assuming. Let's talk about makeup. Do you know any communicable diseases that could come from the application of makeup? That's unsanitary? Right. I do understand that. No, I'm not aware of any particular disease that come from the application of makeup. Again, I know that the greatest concerns that come within the cosmetic industry that have to do with damage and injury to the skin come from those who are engaging in practices like chemical peels and things of that nature. But thank you for your question. Do you further yield? I think I'm going to move to the next question because I know there's a couple that are waiting to ask. Yeah, we have a representative here, Glee, to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman here? Yes. Can you tell me why we should not be concerned about sanitation practices of those who are not licensed, who are going to be doing kitchen, beauty, school, or whatever they're going to be doing because you're talking about protecting the public. So what protections to the public do you think we're going to have if we deregulate in this manner? Right. Certainly important safety practice is important for anybody that has a business owns a business. It would be an issue for anyone who's working in this field in salons. Certainly we allow all of these practices to occur, as I said, in the film and movie industry and in retail environments. I think it's very important to understand what was actually cut and removed from this bill that may have been existing, may have existed in previous bills, working with hot equipment like curling irons and flat irons. That has been removed. The application of chemicals, chemical peels, invasive procedures on the skin and the hair, that has all been removed. What we are talking about here is simply applying makeup that's available over the counter and working with a blow dryer. Does the gentle lady further yield? Yes. It's been my experience that we should also be concerned about the temperature of blow drying. Different cultures have different concerns, but blow drying can damage hair if it's done improperly and it's at too high of temperatures. So people in my community are concerned about that. And I can understand that. And certainly I think it's important to remember that we're talking about items and equipment that likely every woman in this room has used every day of her life. And I know that that gives me some assurance. Lady further yield, you have a couple more? Yes. Representative Hagen to your right is recognized for a question. Do you yield? Yes. Thank you. I'm glad that there are already people practicing in public in these areas at department store counters without a license. This just opens that up to more entrepreneurs. So my question, if you will further, if you will yield, is this, I have in my district in Fitzgerald, Ben Hill County, a program that was started there. It's called the Flex Program. And it's kind of like Shark Tank for the public high school students to encourage entrepreneurship there. One of the areas that I know these young people are interested in trying out a business is in cosmetology. And these are students of all demographics who would like to try their hand at this for this wonderful program that's spreading all over the state to our public schools. So my question is, if this bill would pass, would those students who are interested in trying out their hand at applying makeup and blood drying hair and styling it without the use of these harmful chemicals, would they be able to do that without a license if this bill passed? Yes, they would. And the law would, honestly, provide them with an excellent opportunity to dip them toe into that market. Thank you. And to begin those processes, yes. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, thank you so much. And I yield the well. You have some excellent questions like from Representative Jason Ridley, but I'm glad you yielded the well. I really don't want to hear it. So that's the presentation of the bill. We now have speakers opposed and those in favor of Senate Bill 354. Are the rules imposed by the rules committee? We will allow 30 minutes for those opposed and 30 minutes for those in favor. So Representative Rhonda Taylor is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise to speak against Senate Bill 354 because you're in my world now. My father stopped speaking to me because I came home with a four year education, college degree, and decided to go into the cosmology field, which he thought was media labor. Senate Bill 354, while it does afford an opportunity for some to earn an income without training or experience, it poses a very serious threat and a concern to our society. As you've heard from a couple of my colleagues, it says that heat, for example, is different on different types and textures of hair. Even if you were to burn to the scalp, this we know can open a womb and cause bacterial infections. This is a very serious issue. Blow drying, styling, and I know that the author said that it did not involve the curling operaticis. Online 35, it definitely says that it allows drying, arranging, curling, straightening, and styling with mechanical devices. You need training for this. We were going to do anything with this legislation. It should have been crafting a program out for those who are interested in doing these particular task to do. A six week, six-month course, whatever. But to say that a person can commit for 1,500 hours, and then to do the same thing that a person can commit that does not do any hours, that's not fair. We get student loans when you go to school for cosmology. It's not free. A person goes in and takes a proper classes and training to be able to do everything. We see, she also stated that we're already doing it. That doesn't make it right. Not at all. Those that are doing hair from home or in maces, they're doing it because they've gotten permission from the customer to do that. But to allow these individuals to work without any training, without any sanitation requirements, without the knowledge of basic disease, bacterial diseases, is very scary. And we're taking that risk by voting and passing this legislation. I have seen it. I have almost 25 years in the industry, not only as a technician, but as a director, as an instructor. This is a bad deal. Perhaps if we design something, craft it something that does make a pathway for such an obligation or opportunity. But this is not it. I strongly urge that you vote against Senate Bill 354. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies, yield of the well. Representative Park Cannon is recognized as a speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello, members. I'd love for you to look around the room and look at the different hair styles that you see. And maybe you can name some of those hair styles. But there might also be some hair styles that you know nothing about. You don't even know what they're called. Like for example, what's on my head today. Most people would say these are locks. You would be wrong. These are sister locks. It is a very intricate method of interlocking that takes place. It's not the same as the gel and roll mechanism that many locks you see are made from. I stand here today with a number of cosmologists who say the same thing about makeup. So today I'd like you to look around and see some different ways that makeup is being worn in this room today. Some people have no makeup on and are still able to vote on this bill. And there are many other individuals who do have makeup on. Either they put it on in their house. Maybe they put it on in the anti-room bathroom. Maybe they don't have any on at all. I stand here today with you with lashes on. I would love to ask some of the members, how do you think I got these lashes on? Do you think I glued them by myself? Do you think I went somewhere and a person who was licensed attached them for me? Do you think these are my natural lashes? These are the questions that should deeply be considered before we consider this piece of legislation. Because as much as I am excited for people to be able to get to work post pandemic, are we really sending a message to George's young people that the best they can do is some makeup or some hair with no licensure? Would you like for your daughter's wedding for someone with no licensure to do her hair or to do her bridesmaids makeup? I don't think so. And so I want to point to some of the issues and the facts and the science because it's getting loud for people who don't have this hair or do you's makeup. I want to ask you all to you. I asked a question. Do you know of any communicable diseases that can come from makeup application or doing hair in proper way? And the answer was no. Haven't we all heard of LICE? Has anyone never heard of scabies? These are all communicable issues that can come from this legislation. Now those are some elementary, literally communicable diseases that we see in our kindergarten. In our preschools, in our elementary schools. But there are some more intense ones that if you were paying attention when you came to Capitol today and yesterday, you saw members of the public with large poster boards that said that they are in school for this. And they had listed on their information about the school that they are coming from. And on that, they spoke about a number of different issues that can happen with the improper use of this type of procedures. Let's talk about osteotosis. Does anyone know what that is? Does anyone know what psoriasis is? Some people might know about psoriasis. What about Luka Derma? Some people might know about rosacea. You've heard about rosacea? There are so many other areas of concern that we should be having in this body today. And it is not factual to say that these different communicable diseases will not be spread based on this legislation. I want to lastly just point out for the record that we were all misled by saying that there is no ability for the application of chemicals and using of flat irons and curling irons where it is clearly written here in the bill. And to say that the film industry is doing this to dangle the carrot, oh, the film industry, now we're so worried about the film industry, day 39 of session, to dangle that carrot out there and say that the film industry needs this is simply not factual. The facts. The facts are as such. When we as licensed professionals look to engage in the film industry, we have our tools heat up to 450 to 500 degrees. This industry allows for apprenticeships. These apprenticeships allow for us to get $100 to get started. And the domino effect of this legislation will make it so that that apprenticeship program that does feed into the film industry will be at a halt. So today we need to be more clear about what we're doing. Perhaps we need to consult some more members of the public or of this body who have an understanding of it. Maybe we need to take a pause and wait until next year, but I for one will absolutely be voting in opposition. And I ask you to join me in voting in opposition to this measure so that we can appropriately address the workplace issues and the economic issues as well as the health and science issues that are with this legislation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The ladies, ladies yield the well. Repsident, Mady Barnes, you recognize, speak to the well, speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand in opposition of this bill. And because I have hair that I truly admire and take care of, and I would not want someone who has not practiced or gotten some kind of lesson to put their hands in my hair. I know some of you don't care about this. It doesn't directly affect you. But and today is not the day for me to stand here and talk about my hair because it's raining outside and when water hits my hair, it blows up and it's all afro-y and stuff. So to get it straight, for my hair to get straight, you have to use over 400 degree heat in my hair. And once it hits the water again, it gets puffy again. So I have to put more heat in my hair. I do not want someone with no training putting over 400 degree heat in my hair. If my hair falls out, I will be walking around here grumpy. As much as I smile around here, I would not be smiling that day. Okay, on a serious note, I am a scientist. I have practiced sterile and worked in sterile environments all of my career. Someone who is not trained to come in my lab and just work because our legislative bodies said they don't need a license, it does not fly in my career. So for someone to put their hands in my head and not have any lessons on sterility and how diseases transfer and how heat affects the human body, that is unacceptable. And because you all don't relate, does not mean that we should be making legislation for those it does directly affect. Not only does disease come into my mind when I'm thinking about people who have not been trained, but the hundreds and thousands of women that will be affected if something devastating happens to their crown and some demographics and some demographics and some cultures consider their hair their crown. And so I would like for you all to talk to your colleagues that this directly affects. I would like to think that you would relate by putting yourself in the chair with someone who has no training and put that in your head. Not only do I agree with us creating a workforce pipeline, but creating a workforce pipeline with some training behind it, not just opening the doors for anybody to get into this field. If you had a nurse, would we take away the necessary training for a nurse to enter the pipeline? No, we wouldn't. We wouldn't want somebody who has not had proper training to put their hands on our bodies. So let's consider this as well. I'm standing here in opposition to this bill because I believe it's dangerous. We are also opening the doors for 14 and 15 year olds to enter the field. And so that means 14 and 15 year olds can take this job as well. So I want us to put some serious thought in the facts behind this bill. It's not safe. It creates dangerous situations for our health. And it also creates dangerous situations for people who are sitting in those chairs. So I thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Ladies, yield to the will. I think Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to tell you to vote no on this bill because it is actually a very dangerous bill. Multiple resistant or methamcylin resistant, stafflecoccus orias, also known as MRSA. This is a highly contagious, antibiotic resistant bacteria that if you are infected with it, cannot only make you deathly ill, but it can actually paralyze you or kill you if it gets into your blood. This is a real thing. I'm not making this up. We do not want to make people vulnerable to catching methamcylin resistant, stafflecoccus orias, also known as MRSA. Let me tell you why because when a person gets MRSA, it's not just them that can get it. Anyone who now comes in contact with that person and touches that infection or touches something that that infection touched. So a towel in the same house, a doorknob, they touch their face, they touch the doorknob, you touch the doorknob, you touch your skin. This thing is highly contagious and very hard to treat and can kill you. This is a deadly bill. Let me tell you why. According to the American Academy of Dermatology and according to research done in the journal of applied microbiology, nine out of ten products, nine out of ten products, makeup brushes, the little brush that you use to do mascara, all of these things, the little sponges that you use, those things have bacteria and yeast and other types of fungus that are capable of causing illness. It can cause something as simple as a skin infection that you can't get rid of, all the way to the point of causing blood poisoning if it happens to get access to the inside of your body by way of a cut or even a little scrape. This is serious. When we are allowing people to apply things like makeup, we have to make sure that they are equipped with this knowledge. A basic understanding of this is very important. And if we don't do this, imagine what it would be like if you were a 14-year-old and you want to start your makeup business and you go around and you start applying makeup to all of your friends and then your friends catch a deadly infection. You're 14 years old, all you wanted to do was start a business. And now, something really horrible has happened. You know who has failed you, the adults in the room. Because we need to have basic safety standards when it comes to this stuff. There is research that shows that makeup brushes can be dirtier than a toilet. Makeup brushes can be dirtier than a toilet.

here than a toilet. You need to understand that stuff before you start applying makeup to people other than yourself. Doing your own makeup is fine, but when you start sharing things, that is actually very dangerous. And we need to make sure that the people who are doing it understand this. There have been cases where people have almost lost their lives. There have been cases where people have actually had to have limbs amputated because of MRSA. This is not something we should be taking lightly. Please, please, please consider what we're voting on today. I know as a member of the minority party, we don't get an opportunity a lot of times to stop bad things from happening, but I'm telling you, y'all, this is really bad. I have a PhD in microbiology. This is literally what I do for a living. And I'm telling you, this is a bad bill. Please consider what we're voting on today. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies, yielded the well. That completes the presentations of those opposed to the bill. Now we're here for up to, up to 30 minutes for those in favor. Representative Hagen has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I plan to speak in favor of this bill, but there are some things that I think ought to be addressed here. When we're talking about what is on the paper that we are considering now. We are talking about shampooing, blow drying, styling. We're talking about using the same products that any of us could leave this building right now and go to target and purchase. That is what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. This bill does not get rid of a cosmetology license, which is an important license, but it takes approximately 1500 hours of coursework to get that license. That's an expensive thing to do. It's a time consuming thing to do, and I certainly am not suggesting that it's not a needed license because it is, but we are talking about, again, very basic products and techniques that any of us could do in here right now. So to say that it's okay for someone to apply makeup at a store counter without a license is, and this is almost exactly what was just said from this well, is okay because they have the customer's permission. I would submit to you as actually an argue for why this bill makes good sense. Because we're talking about customers' permission. We're talking about something that is already taking place at department store counters around this country. I won't bring up the movie industry, but it's, or license is not required there either for these basic techniques. So, I felt like that was a good argument and favor of this legislation. I do want to bring up a program. I alluded to it in a question that I asked the bill sponsor earlier. I would like to bring some attention to a program that started in South Georgia. It's called the Flex Program. And this program is to show high school students that they can be business owners. It encourages entrepreneurship. It's about a six month long program that takes place when the public school there. And it's extended, I think, now to 10 different school systems when they're gone through the cooperation of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce is to expand it around the state. But this program encourages people to try a business. And I know because I've worked very closely as a judge in this competition. And with the founder of this program, that one of the businesses, these young people in rural Georgia are interested in starting is cosmology. Well, obviously in high school, they can't go get a 1500 hour cosmology license. But if they could, with the help of a mentor, or work with these basic skills, blow drying, styling, applying makeup, we're talking about something that could be a way up for a lot of particularly young women in rural Georgia. This license is very important, but it is one that can be very exclusionary because of the cost of the training and the time that is involved. So again, you know, important license, but I believe since we're talking about products, it techniques that are available to us right now, at any time, I do not feel like this is something that is dangerous. And to that, finally, and then I will step aside Mr. Speaker. A lot has been said about there's no training and a lot of diseases, and it does sound very scary, but I would refer you back to what the previous speakers have said. Someone can do these things at a store counter with no license today, today. So if it is that dangerous, I would hope that next session, if someone would drop a bill that would outlaw, these practices at the department store counter because they've been going on for decades, and if they're that dangerous, we certainly would want to bring stop to it. So Mr. Speaker, I just would like to encourage everyone here to vote in favor of this measure. It encourages entrepreneurship. It encourages people who may not have another opportunity to step into the valuable field of cosmology, where they may not otherwise have the opportunity. And I just ask you to vote in favor of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies, you yielded the well. Reps. Mission Maynors recognize the speak to the bill, Reps. And the main. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was not planning to be up here today, but I can definitely speak with legitimacy, if you will. As a black woman, I love to wear my hair many different ways. You guys saw me wear my hair in braids. A lot of you said, you know what? I really like your hair in braids. Guess what? There, you do not have to have a license to get your hair braided. When you, when I take my daughter to get her hair braided, some braiders braid your hair really tight. If you braid the hair really tight, you can do things to the scout that are unhealthy. If anything, we should be looking at how people are braiding here. But let's talk about this bill. In committee, it was a Bob Hartison bill, Democrats voted for this bill, Republicans voted for this bill. One of my concerns was the flat irons and the curling irons. It took a lot of debate, but we finally got the amendment pass to remove curling irons and flat irons. So that has been taken out of this. The other thing I want to say is to get your hair inflation is going up. If you go to the hair salon, if a black woman in Atlanta, Georgia goes to the hair salon to get her hair shampooed and washed, you will not believe how much it costs. It might cost 90 to 120 dollars to get your hair washed. I know you're looking confused. And so that's because those people are cosmologists. And so this bill, the people that will blow dry hair and shampoo hair, they cannot advertise as a cosmologist. They can't do that. They cannot charge. Well, they can charge whatever they want, but most likely a citizen that is being selective of who's going to be in their hair, they're not going to go to the person at charges and 90 to 120 dollars because they're not a cosmologist. They're just blow drying and shampooing hair. Another thing I want to bring up, and it's just kind of interesting that this bill is even here, but think about Dominican hair salons. A lot of people, half of the people in this room may know what Dominican hair salons are. Half of you may not. A Dominican hair saline is when you go and they call it a Dominican hair saline because it is a form of hair styling that came from the Dominican Republic. These people, a lot of them, are not cosmologists. They're blow drying your hair and the way they blow dry your hair, you can also curl it. This bill means that these people, women, men from the Dominican Republic, legal immigrants, if they want to go into this blow drying business, now they don't have that upfront cost of the education. We like how they do our hair when we go to the Dominican hair salons. The other thing I want to mention, during committee, there were, if you, during committee, there were several young women that came to the committee saying, we are, we work underneath cosmologists. We work underneath hair designers. We cannot afford to go out and get a full-blown cosmology license. So guess what, there were several cosmologists here that came to committee and said, we love this bill because we can train people in an apprenticeship sort of way. So I want to just wrap up and say, this is not deadly. There are a lot of deadly things that can happen in the world. This is, I would not call this the deadliest bill of the year. There are some people that agree with me. What I would say is this allows a lot of young people that are interested in going into this industry to enter into it slowly without a huge upfront cost. The other thing I will say is, I'm really happy that the amendment passed, where it does not include curling irons, it does not include flat irons. My original amendment actually said 300 degrees or less. We could not put a temperature in the bill because how do you police a temperature? But you can police a curling iron or a flat iron. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Lady has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. We will now, we've heard from both those opposed and those in favor. Now we will have the chairman's time. So, 20 minutes, right? For up to 20 minutes, the chair's time. Chairman Powell has recognized for the chairman's time. Chairman Powell. You all heard the debate. This is important bill. Chairman Powell recognizes for the chairman's time for up to 20 minutes, Chairman Powell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I've been telling people for 30 years. Don't feel around. I'm going to ask you to come back and ask for the chairman's time. I'm going to ask you to come back and ask for the chairman's time. Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I've been telling people for 30 years. Don't feel around with cosmontology bills. We saw it last year and we see it this year. So, with that being said, I'm going to relinquish the chairman's time for the chairman count. Chairman, the camp has recognized to speak to the bill. Chairman's time. Thank you. Chairman, the camp. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Chairman Powell. We all have the choice on who does our hair. Let's be realistic. But there are times when we're having family photos, we're having maybe headshots, we're going to some event, we want to look a little better than we normally do. It's not always feasible to have a cosmologist come see you. I know the cosmologist who works on me every six to eight weeks, she charges a good bit of money for time. Quite honestly, I'd $100 an hour, basically, is what it cost to be with a good cosmologist and monopolize his or her time. So, it's not always feasible. And there are a number of individuals who are operating in this state right this minute, who are doing hair and makeup. If you go to the University of Georgia, there are a litany of young men and young women who will do hair and makeup. They would love to have a business license. They would love to report that they have income. They are working to, with students and people in the area, making money, doing hair and makeup. Again, we're not talking about flat irons or curling irons. We're not talking about chemicals. If you look on in the bill, online 32 through 39, there seem to be a little confusion on what the bill actually does. It says, blow dry styling means the practice of only shampooing conditioning, drying, arranging curling, straightening hair. But then it goes on to say, such items, let's say, okay, mechanical devices online 35, shall not include any flat irons or curling irons. Of course, we've all had our hair blown dry and it's been a little warm. Quite honestly, if you have an issue with your hair burning, you need to go see a cosmologist. If you have an issue with your scalp, go see a cosmologist. If you have an issue with a skin condition or you feel like you may have something going on with your body, go see a cosmologist. I'm going to tell you, if you have an open sore or you have something, a skin condition, they're not going to work on you. They're going to tell you to go to a dermatologist. I can tell you right now, more than likely, I can guess that the individuals that are working without a license doing hair and makeup right now, they're going to tell you to do the same thing because they're not going to want to get involved in that. Something interesting that Representative Mayner mentioned was hair braiding. Hair braiding was actually carved outside of the Cosmetology license in 2006. It has never been included again. So any of us could go and have our hair braided right now. And that person very likely is not going to be licensed as a Cosmetologist. I know many people do this and they feel safe in that environment. I know many people, my daughter included who's had hair and makeup done. And quite honestly, they did a wonderful job. They came very highly referenced. She felt they did a very clean job. They cleaned their instruments. Now, hiring who you hire, we've all hired house painters. We've all hired people to come in and do various things in our homes. And if they didn't do a good job, we would not hire them again and we certainly would not recommend them. So just because someone has a shingle on their door saying that they'll do your hair and makeup and they're honestly advertising they're not licensed. This is disclosed fully. People can make the choice on what they're going to do if they're going to hire this person or not to do their hair and makeup. I wouldn't wait to discuss for a moment a real life person. I wish I had had a chance to call him in advance because I think he'd been very excited to hear me say his name. But his name is Jamari and Bailey and he lives in Thomas, in Georgia. He is a nursing and business student. And for some reason, he got very interested in makeup. He actually has partnered with a company and he has developed a makeup brand that he sells. And it's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. But Jamariin does not have a cosmetology license. So if I went to see Jamariin and asked him to apply some of these beautiful, beautiful, vibrant colors that he has developed with a company that does this, he could not apply them to me legally because he doesn't have a cosmetology license. This is a work bill. This is a bill that's going to get people making money. This is an opportunity for people to do things they're good out already that are making YouTube videos. I mean, let's face it, there are people probably making more money on YouTube videos than they are actually doing people's hair. So this is an opportunity for people to express themselves, to share their skillset and quite honestly get individuals working. Which to me is the most important thing we can do as a state is get out of the way of people supporting themselves and taking care of their families. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield the rest of my time to Representative Earhart. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a couple of quick points I wanted to mention here before we wrap up. I think that we would be remiss if we didn't recognize that the blow drying of hair, the application of makeup, it is a burgeoning and growing cottage industry in our state, particularly during COVID. When a lot of folks were housebound, they weren't going out far. Folks, this is happening right now across the state. Lots of individuals, I know this because I've had them in my office. They are predominantly representative of what I would call lower income segment of our society, predominantly minority. All we're doing is saying you don't have to do it in secret now. These simple steps of blow drying here in applying makeup, low risk activities. I know we've heard some scary facts and figures today. We've heard some things that kind of frighten us. They're going to catch diseases, have our limbs amputated from touching doorknobs. Let's be very clear about facts. Because facts don't lie. The facts are that 13 other states have deregulated these practices. There has not been one IOTA, not one bit of data to show any increase in transmittable diseases, not MRSA, not any of the host of diseases that were mentioned in this well today. I think facts and figures are important. I think it's when you start scaring folks with that sort of information. It's very, very important to put it in perspective. Ladies and gentlemen, I just want you to remember that we are in the business of making it easier to work in the state of Georgia. We know that on this particular issue that the most over-regulated perhaps industry is the cosmology industry at a rate that far exceeds that of anything else. You don't have to be licensed to be a chef in this state. So the folks that are preparing your food each day and when you visit a restaurant, those individuals don't have to be licensed. I encourage you to consider it a firmative vote for this pro-business, small business, pro-woman piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies, you're the well. Good discussion, House. Is there any objections to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitutes were drawn. Is there any objection to adopt any substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none of the rules committee's substitute is adopted.

We'll have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Jasmine Clark-Rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that I have a PhD in microbiology? I am very good at research. And even if I didn't have a PhD in microbiology, I'm very good at using Google. And it does not take long to do a Google search to see that, yes, Merse, is one of the bacteria that can be found on makeup brushes. And Merse is very dangerous, contagious, and can be deadly. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? I think that's true. I've read your resume. Your smart representative. For what purpose is represented? Sure, per rise. On parliamentary inquiry. Stage inquiry. Is it not true that I'm a big, big supporter of entrepreneurship? Also, I'm very concerned that there's no oversight in this particular bill that we're talking about. There's no basic training that includes sanitation. Also, I'm concerned about the liability that will be put on these new business owners in case something happens. So, for the record, I'm just saying that I will be okay with a small amount of hours, at least to train them and what they are doing, and also sanitation. But if not, I'm totally against this bill for the record. Is that not true? I believe that's true, the total gentleman states. For what purpose is represented? The bird rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stage inquiry. Is it not true we should be more concerned about a doctor mutilating our children than the licensure of cosmology? I'm sure the lady has her opinion.

Any event that a practitioner applying one of these services, whether it be makeup, that's made out of a product that's based in almond butter or shampoo that's made out of a product based in natural coconut oil, there is the potential of me having an exposure of anaphylactic shot and any other consumer that would have visited that particular establishment. Is that not true, sir? Yes, ma'am. That's true. And that's what's important about personal responsibility. Thank you, sir. Where you go? For what purposes, representative readily rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stage inquiry. Mr. Speakers, is it not true that I also have one of those three lettered degrees called a GED? And these people have the people that's opposing this bill have scared this house so bad that they're going to end up putting cosmology out of business because half the people back there don't even want to go get a haircut anymore.

Speaker and colleagues if you'll remember House bill 1090 pass this body 160 to 1 It's a it's a bill that deals with Young Georgians who are aging out of the foster care program. It's something we started a couple of years ago To help with both mentorship with nutrition educational expenses housing These are very vulnerable individuals that have been involved in the foster care system once again I said it passed 160 to 1 in the house the Senate did make a few changes where it passed 50 to nothing They corrected a couple of items on the ages a lot of these children get a little behind and getting their Colt their high school degree and may need help getting a GED They may not get that until 21 so if they're gonna get help with technical school or college They may need help up to age 25 so we did expand a little bit the number of Individuals that could be helped we did clarify some of the definitions like mentorship services that are so important and and helping these former foster children make the successful transition to adulthood the Senate also added some additional guard rails to make sure that when Tax credit funds are donated that they are they will will definitely know that a Minimum of 80% will be spent actually helping the children and not going to just to administrative overhead The Senate did make one change that we'd like to change in the amendment the amendment is AM 5-0 0086 it's on your desks They did raise the amount from 20 million dollar cap that we have currently to a 30 million dollar cap on further discussion and ways and means and amongst our body We feel like since the 20 million dollar cap wasn't reached last year that the wisest course is to keep the cap at 20 million dollars So that's all the amendment does is keep the cap where it is that the Senate was attempting to change and obviously in the next year or two if It turns out the program is fully subscribed and and we get good feedback on it We can certainly then look to expand the cap. So that's that's my the bill and the amendment sir General you have a question certainly a representative fry to your left has a question Thank you Mr. Speakers is gentleman you certainly On lines 33 And 34 It seems to add a business enterprise meaning any insurance company or the headquarters of any insurance company And I might I miss that ways and means meeting but is that Giving the insurance companies access to this tax credit as well as private individuals it does it does we already had to Like a lot of our systems. We allow sub chapter S and other partnerships to participate But that's just income taxes that you can send a portion of your income tax obligation to some of these organizations This does allow Insurance companies that don't pay income taxes. They pay premium taxes it allows them to participate That was in the original house bill and that was unchanged in the Senate Okay, deep further you sir. Deep further you sure Do you feel like it's good policy to give insurance companies a tax credit in today's federal I mean in today's Business climate well I certainly would agree with the gentleman the premise is is that insurance companies are not They're not receiving a tax credit in this. They're just they're it's costing them the same amount of money It would cost whether they sent the their taxes to the Department of Insurance the same way of another company might send their income taxes to the Department of Revenue The the cost to the insurance company saves them no money at all This just allows them to designate a portion of their Tax obligation that they're going to have to pay eat one way or the other It allows them to designate a location or in this case a cause that can be beneficial to Georgians Okay, further clarification question friendly question. It's all been friendly by the way I really just want to make sure that I understand that the insurance companies are not getting any break because of this great bill That helps the foster kids out in the foster program in the states and correct you're absolutely correct in that and I appreciate the question The insurance companies are not saving any money with this program This is just this is just an effort to make sure we can get the adequate help to the children that need it without any benefit to an insurance company appreciate that thank you sir Gentlemen yield for another where you have no further questions.

Mr. Speaker, I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute House Bill 1410. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1410 to be titled back to Ben Chapter 3. It's out of late. The official go to Georgia and say to late in the housing. Generally so is established a stable housing accountability program. Chair recognizes leader of the station to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1410 was the legislation to create the accountability program for the homeless. This program, as you recall, is completely voluntary. Would allow for homeless individuals to enter into this program. And there'd be certain accountability standards that would have to be met. Local organizations would administer this. There'd be the opportunity for private funds as well as state funding that we appropriate. And this would be separate, and apart from existing state housing trust fund monies that do have strings attached to it received from the federal government. The legislation has been very favorably received in committee, both in the House and Senate. There's been bipartisan support. I'm very proud of this. Body's work to advance this legislation to address homelessness. And the language that was changed in the Senate was all based upon my recommendations, meeting with the Department of Community Affairs and other partners to ensure that there would be perfect conformity with existing money that's received. Existing programs would not be impacted. We included some revised definitions and then also made clear in a separate sentence that only the money that is appropriate to the accountability program would be restricted for use based upon the measures that are included. That's for the body's favorable consideration and vote green on House Bill 1410. Gentlemen, I have a question. If you don't have a question, yes, sir. I'll have a couple of them as a matter of fact.
