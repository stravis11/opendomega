Sorry.
Morning everybody.
Morning.
Rep Martin.
>> Morning everybody. Uh we'll go ahead and
and start our meeting on recognized
chairman Newton to open us up with a
word of prayer.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Join with me.
Father, thank you for the opportunity to

that as we also serve the people of
Georgia and our fellow representatives
and legislators. Thank you for this
time. Uh give us wisdom from you in
Jesus name.
Thank you, sir.
I'd like to recognize Representative
Martin uh has an announcement he wants
to make, I think.
>> Thank Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just
wanted uh ask the rules committee if
they'd join me in welcoming a
constituent down from Alfredo High
School, Miss Holly Magcguire, in the
back for uh coming down to see uh the
business of Georgia done today.
>> Stand up so we can
Glad to have you visiting today. Thank
you. Okay, let's go ahead and begin over
here.
>> Chairman Hagen.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee. I
have House Bill 657. It is about halfway
down the blue sheet.
This bill provides consistency of care
and quality of support for a person or
family in substance use abuse recovery
by defining certified peer specialists
and laying out requirements for recovery
community organizations.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank
you,
>> Senator Huffeller.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got Senate
Bill 162, which is the next to last one
on the sheet. This is a hold over from
last year due to it had turned into
multiple subjects and it's restored now
to its original bill and it's shorter
because appropriations were made to the
Composite Medical Board that put in a
new system that's up and running and
already showing major improvements.
They're doing a great job over there
now. And in the past, it's taken way too
long to credential and license our
physicians and physician assistants. And
of course, these come under the
composite medical board. Our nurses come
under the secretary of state. So this
only can deal with with them on this
system. But so I semi-retired a couple
of years ago with a spotless record. And
to work across town, it took me three
and a half months to get through the
credentiing process. And I know people I
mean I I did a lot faster than some
people did, but they had a severe
shortage of anesthesia staff. and um it
um it's it's certainly been a problem,
but because they've done so much work,
the bill is shorter now. So, we're only
looking at two things in this bill, and
the composite medical board agrees.
One's to allow for an administrative
approval. The way it is right now, if
the board were to meet today, and your
paperwork's in tomorrow, then you can't
work until the board meets again on
March 5th. And this would allow them to
administratively approve it, get them
working, and then the the full board can
come um ratify it later on. The second
item, which has the full support of the
Georgia Hospital Association, will allow
for hospitals to input credentiing
information and would allow for uh
individuals to be credentialed
statewide.
Um, and this may need some additional
software and it's going to be subject to
appropriation. So, we've actually
already done this for our medical
students. They were spending hundreds of
dollars getting credentialed at every
hospital they went to. Dr. Paul Brock,
who's a general surgeon and he's the
dean of the Northwest Georgia campus,
did this, set this up. It's it's
working. And that's why I refer to this
as the Paul Brock Act because he went
ahead and did it. And um this will be
able to get people out almost
immediately to help out when somebody's
out on disability, pregnancy leave,
whatever. you know, quite often the
baby's a couple of months old before you
can get somebody credentialed um to work
in that facility. Um
so that's that's the the bill and
certainly entertain any questions.
>> We do have a question, Chairman Powell.
>> Thank you to my friend. You know, you
bring this up about the composite board.
I've been talking about this for quite a
while. We passed some bills a year or
two, session or two back. asked by the
general assembly, signed by the
government to give shortterm
prescription rights to APAs and PAs
under doctor's protocol.
>> But yet here we are a session or two
after they have passed and there's still
a hold up because the composite board
hasn't passed the rules and rigs and it
sounds to me like there's other issues
that's going on over there
>> there there are emergency procedures in
place and I think those happen in some
cases. Um but two things they didn't
have the um the software in place to do
this and the second thing is um the
delay from when the board can meet can
sometimes happen to that. But the the
bigger issue here that wasn't dealt with
in that and that was some some good
measures is that the hospitals when we
get the the software ready can input
their credentiing information in there.
And so it'll be a one-stop shopping now
instead of the hospital doing their work
and the composite medical board doing
their work. It'll all be together. And
if you're credentialed in this hospital
and and everything's in place, you can
immediately go on and work at another
hospital that needs you then without
going through an emergency process. It
sounds like the issue that you've got
and the one that I mentioned that we
have some issues with the composite
board. It may may or may not be all
technology based, but I'd like to talk
to you offline.
>> Sure. to give your advice
>> and and I advice.
>> I I will, but I I will say that the new
director has made major strides now. I I
think we're down to about 30 days now
when it used to be many many months. Um
but this would get it down to uh you
know potentially instantaneously. We've
done this with the medical students of
Augusta and um Paul Brock did and it's
working great for the students. Once we
saw that, we said, "Well, let's go ahead
with the PAS and the and the positions."
>> Okay. Thank you. I have another
question. Secretary Kelly.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman
Hoseller, thank you for being with us.
When you speak to the credentiing piece
here, you mean only allowing the
provider to have access to the hospital
facility to practice. This doesn't have
any relationship to the credentiing
through the insurance companies or the
payers for that aspect. Correct.
>> Correct. This you know that the medical
board composite medical board license
you the hospital credentials you this
software upgrade when we put it in place
will allow the hospitals to put input in
and then they will be credentialed in
that facility. And um I know both the
the CEOs of the hospitals in Rome want
this as soon as we can do it to help out
with the shortage they've got. They'll
be credentialed immediately in both
facilities and can use people at both
places or any other hospitals.
>> Thank you,
>> Senator. Do they have another question?
Uh whip park.
>> Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Huffeller, thank you for the
bill. Um as I'm just reviewing um the
committee substitute on line 27 um it's
permissive with respect to certain
parameters for the recommended system.
It's a may not a shall. Is there
intentionality around there?
>> We didn't want to force any hospital to
say you have to do this but they can put
eventually when this is implemented they
can put any information they want into
this system and it will allow them to do
it. So you're right it's not it doesn't
force anybody to do it but I can tell
you they all want it. Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you, Senator. I know many of us
have had some calls and concerns about
the licensing and the protocol and and
the credentiing and everything and Thank
you. I don't see any other questions.
Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you,
Representative Clifton.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh I will be uh
brief. We're looking at uh HB 9573 from
the bottom. Um this is the miniature
truck bill. We passed this out of the
house last year um almost with unanimous
consent. Uh it got to the Senate and had
some additions added on to it. Um and
therefore because of that the governor
decided that he did not like some of
those additions. Uh through the process
of all of this, uh the governor's office
has told us they do support the bill the
way that we had written it and would
support um getting it all the way
through.
>> Whip Park has a question for you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, represent
Clifton, thank you for the bill. The one
question I had was
>> So, yes, if the this bill would allow um
these vehicles to be driven on county
and city roads unless marked. So, if the
counties and cities decide they do not
want them, they would be um need to I'm
not going to be specific on how they
would do it, but they would need to
communicate that so that they would not
be allowed to be driven.
I
>> I would leave that up to the locals on
how they want to decide to inform people
that they don't want these on there. I
would assume a a road sign would
definitely be one way that they could go
about that route.
>> Leader Fistration has a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative
Clifton, it feels like we've taken this
mini truck issue up year after year
after year after year. With respect to
the question that was just asked, is
this any different in any way than the
legislation that's been feels like
regularly passed by this body over the
last few years? And um we're just trying
to trying to get done this year.
>> Yes, sir. There was one number changed
on this bill and it went from 2025 to
2026 if the bill passes. Everything else
goes back to the original language.
>> So this is the same measure which has
been repeatedly passed overwhelmingly by
the Georgia House.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Thank you.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Chairman McDonald.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh I have two
bills. if if I can present them both,
sir. Uh first bill, it's HB944.
It's on the front page about 3/4 of the
way down. This is just a federal
guidelines that are given to us each
year that our commercial vehicle
enforcement division has to enforce o
over our motor carriers that are going
up and down our interstates. All we do
every year is change the date to this
year, we change from 2025 to 2026.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. You got
another one? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, uh
this this is a public safety bill that's
not only will help protect our law
enforcement, but it'll it'll help
protect our families that are going up
and down the road.
>> What's the number?
>> Oh, sorry. HB02
HB1022.
>> It's on the back page.
>> Okay. Go ahead.
>> Again, this is a a public safety bill
that's not only going to help protect
our law enforcement, but help our
families that are going up and down the
road. There's technology in everything.
So, today we got technology and wind
attending. Uh people are have the
ability now to put a film that's
electronic on their on their front
windshields, side windshills, and their
back windshields that that they can
control and control the amount of tent
that they want their windows to be. In
current law right now, wind attent
around 32% plus or minus three. Uh with
with this technology, they're they can
take it up to 100% or take it down to
zero. And the same thing with license
plates. This bill will also repeal a
measure back in 2017 where we we
authorized electronic license plates
where you can sit with an app and and
change what you want on your license
plate. Uh just this a couple weeks ago
there was three cars in Atlanta with the
same license plate riding around and the
flock system picked all of them up. Uh
also with this technology they can tint
their license plate. So this is also
outlawing that. Uh for the first offense
it'll be $500 and any offense after that
will be a thousand. So basically if your
law enforcement sees somebody with
attended window that cannot see in the
car, they pull them over, they can hit a
button and make their windows go clear.
Um, it's proven that also with dark
tended windows, what what you can't see
in, they can't see out. And so this also
protects us going up and down the road,
our families, uh, for the people that
have this dark tinted window that they
can, you know, in intersections and can
see us going up and down the road.
>> Okay. Whip Park has a question for you.
it. We, you know, we it's got to be we
have a law that that says 32%. So that's
as high as you can go. You can go lower
than 32% plus or minus three, but you
know, law enforcement, they have a a a
measure that they gauge electronic
machine that they put on the window to
to see. So, you know, by now we're, you
know, the law only allows 32%. So, um
>> I haven't had any discussion with them.
>> Okay. Have a question. Chair Martin, is
that you?
Try try the mic next to you there. That
one's not coming on.
Try.
>> We usually can hear you when you talk.
>> Try the one on the other side. Let's try
that one.
>> I can hear you.
>> Well, talk loud. Okay. Go ahead.
My question is
>> it it
that would be a v vague part in the
bill. I do not have any any specifics.
Sunshine
very careful.
Okay. Chairman Powell has a question for
you.
Try the one next to you there. We have a
little difficulty this morning.
Well, just talk loud. There's a little
technical issue here.
There it is.
that that is a big part of it, you know,
with with changing our our tag system.
We used to have stamp tags and that's
that's become a problem because now
they're there are vinyl tags and they're
easy to to change uh with putting
another vinyl label on them which you
know your stamp tags you could not do
that. Then of course when we uh did the
electronic tag you can it's all an app
so you can put whatever you want to on
that. But the main thing is the safety
is as I said before what what you when
you can't see in the car well because
the tent's too dark they can't see out.
So that's another safety issue we have
to take into consideration is is our
families going up down the road and the
people that are driving these cars. They
can't see us either.
>> Okay. I don't see any other questions.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you
committee.
>> Well, excuse me. We do have a question.
I'm sorry.
>> All right. Chairman Liby, you had a
question, didn't you?
>> You pass. Okay. Anybody? I don't see any
no other questions.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Uh,
okay. We're having a little difficulty
here with the mics. Uh got a couple of
members who want to ask for something.
We're going to try your mic and if it
doesn't work, we'll let you come to the
podium. How about that? Okay. U Chairman
Hawkins.
Nope. If you would just go to the podium
and
apologize. We'll try to get them to
check this out for us.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm asking
for HB9, I mean, excuse me, 629's on the
front page. Um, this is a bill that we
had last year, and this bill is now a
substitute. It includes a very important
issue with stop the bleed kits.
It adds these kits, the training for
these kits to the CPR and AED trainings
that are taught in our school to the
response teams. Uh this issue actually
came about after the Appalachi school
shooting and unfortunately got
sidetracked when a member of the
commission was moved to Washington. Um
this is supported by the commission
trauma commission and the regional
trauma commission. The kits are provided
uh to the schools free of charge from a
national source. I have placed in the
bill that is it will be upon
appropriations. Uh, so in case something
happens in Washington and that money
gets lost, we'll find a way to pay for
it in Georgia. Protect our children.
That's the bill.
>> Okay.
I don't see any questions. Thank you.
>> Chair Lady Cooper, you have one. You can
use the use this mic. See if that one
works for you.
>> Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, on
the first page about six or seven up
from the bottom is 17 717. House 717. Uh
some of us that have been here a long
time will remember when we had pain
clinics popping up everywhere and a real
problem with opioids being given and
other drugs mainly by orally. And we had
to uh have the medical board enact
regulations and rules about who could
own them. And this bill follows the same
thing except we're even in a worse
situation. ketamine which is an
extremely extremely dangerous drug only
FDA approved for anesthesia and even
when an anesthesia
fact that the patient has had it. So
these
checking
It's like we will have
9% what they wanted to do. uh and also
it sets up you know uh about
administration even for physi they were
requiring it through advanced airway uh
management training that's how danger it
is that a general physician would
advanced training to they get so
answer questions
>> okay have a question for you
representative Kelly thank you ma mr
chairman
Madam Chair, thank you for the
legislation. I I understand this is a
dangerous drug that's being
administered. Are there current
individuals owning this? Are there
current facilities owned today that
don't meet the ownership structure
prescribed in this bill?
>> Yes.
>> And are we divesting anyone's interest
that owns them today?
>> No.
>> So if you're if you own one of these
today,
>> we're not going to force you to sell or
divest your interest.
>> No.
>> No.
>> No. I would like for it to be that way
because they're dangerous and why they
will have to register with the board.
Just register so we know where they are.
I would hope that once their standards
put in place that they would want to up
their facility to meet standards, not
about the ownership maybe, but that they
would have a defibrill
intubate a patient if they were having
airway problems. Uh because I would that
once you have standard in place, if
they're smart, they wouldn't want to
take the chance of having a really bad
reaction and the lawyers, you know,
going at them because there were
standards and they weren't meeting them.
Um, they are starting up all over the
state. There's probably somewhere about
20 plus of them now that we know of
owns one. He has talked to people and he
that most of them are not having
be an anesthesiologist and he has he
said everything that he would have in
the O to help with patients but he says
he's talked to these people over the
state and if you go out on his website
has through it uh he has a ketamine
academy which is what you do to set him
up and that's why he was talking but he
was very with me
>> I agree with you I hope They bring them
up to senators as well. I was just
curious about the ownership aspect.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
>> The grandfather in
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions on
that.
>> Any other member of the committee have
anything they want to present this
morning?
Okay. Let's do this. Let's set a
calendar for Friday,
the legislative day number 14,
House Bill 629. Do I hear a move?
>> Have a motion and a second. Is there any
opposition?
It's on.
House Bill 945.
>> Moved and seconded. Any opposition?
It's on. Okay. House Bill 980.
Have a move and second. Any opposition?
It's on. Okay. Don't forget today we got
the budget on the floor. We will not
have a rules meeting tomorrow. We will
not meet tomorrow. Our next rules
meeting will be Monday at 900 am. Monday
at 900 am. Thank you. We're journed.
