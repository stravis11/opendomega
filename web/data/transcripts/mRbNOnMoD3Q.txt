a special greetings to Shaw Blackman who
serves District 146 the area of my home
and of course he is in my home church
and I say to you Shaw and to all of
those who serve our Middle Georgia area
as Representatives thank you for your
support of the ongoing mission of Robins
Air Force Base a great economic engine
for our entire State and especially
Middle Georgia and a vital point for the
security and peace of our nation and
world I live so close to the base that
every morning I hear I hear Reveille
every afternoon the national anthem and
every evening at 10 o'clock taps and
those are the sounds of freedom and also
the sacrifice that makes that freedom
possible
I want to give a special greeting to one
of our keepers of the door today Tom
Brown
is here and at the back door and he is
uh the older brother of my
brother-in-law Paul and I wanted to
mention that and he and his wife Betty
are here today
and to all of you in the house thank you
for your labors of love and and
sacrifice and all that you do to keep
Georgia growing the United States and
the world we collectively impact it's a
very special honor to be with you today
I wanted to read from Exodus 15 verses
22-25 then Moses LED Israel from the Red
Sea and they went out into the desert
ashore for three days they traveled into
the desert without finding water when
they came to Mara they could not drink
its water because it was bitter that is
why the place is called Mara
so the people grumbled against Moses
saying what are we to drink then Moses
cried out to the Lord and the Lord
showed him a piece of wood and he threw
that wood into the water and the water
became sweet
you know the setting of that text is not
unlike the world in which we live and
the sphere of influence in which you
were called to operate in this house
the children of Israel had just come off
a mighty victory in Egypt but only three
days out into their Journey their
attitude was what have you done for me
lately
whether in the church or in the state we
do serve people but on any given day we
may hear the people Grumble and if it
involves something essential the
grumbling can escalate into a bitter
chorus of complaining and blaming
I think we're living
in some of the most bitter times in our
nation and in our world what can we do
to make those better well enter Moses
you know Moses was a a great leader but
even great leaders can get frustrated
my oldest granddaughter Olivia loves to
tell me jokes and stumped me with
riddles and last week she asked me this
question who is the greatest sinner in
the Bible
that's in my wheelhouse I thought I
should know that my thoughts quickly
went from the Old Testament Jezebel to
the New Testament Judas but her answer
was Moses
and I asked her why and she said because
Papa he broke all the Commandments
[Music]
and indeed
when he came down off that mount
with the law of God codified in stone
and he saw what the people were doing in
his absence he became angry and
frustrated and threw those on the ground
figuratively breaking every law you know
I think that's a parable for our times
we're hearing and seeing lived out a lot
of bitterness not just because of
essential needs not being met
but essential laws that are not being
kept
when we hear and read again about gun
violence and mass shootings it seems
we've forgotten a simple law you shall
not kill or more accurately you shall
not murder in watching the
disintegration of the family we've
forgotten honor your father and your
mother truth has become even more of a
rare commodity because we've forgotten
and not understood the words you shall
not lie and you shall not bear false
witness against your neighbor
and whether it involves a petty theft or
the violation of the boundaries of a
Sovereign Nation we have forgotten laws
like you shall not steal and you shall
not covet what belongs to your neighbor
we must revisit these shattered laws and
reteach them to our children that the
Next Generation May understand the
difference between right and wrong but
where do we start you know when I look
at Moses in our text today the first
thing he did was cry out to God
he prayed
and prayer is always essential thank you
for having this time of prayer and
devotion every day when you meet in
Jeremiah 33 3 God says call upon me and
I will show you Great and Mighty things
you know not of
within our story Moses calls upon the
Lord he prays and the Lord shows him
something great just a piece of wood
and he took that piece of wood and he
threw it in the waters and the waters
became sweet and the people could drink
I think a point is in facing the
bitterness of our times if we pray
God will show us something close at hand
something within our reach to take in
hand and help turn bitter Waters sweet
again in our society
maybe it's uh kind words spoken or
written acts of kindness or a hand
that's reached across this aisle or
maybe across an ocean in cooperation
it may become your life's work
I'm going to mention someone today who's
on all of our minds and his former U.S
president and former governor of our
state Jimmy Carter you know he's kind of
like a Moses figure in our state and
really in our nation Jimmy Carter became
president at one of the most bitter
times in our nation's history and it did
involve water Watergate
and for a short season President Carter
entered into the bitter Waters of our
nation at that time and helped us turn
the page from that bitterness and make
things sweet again
during his presidency like Moses he had
and he was an intermediary between Egypt
and Israel helping to uh broker a piece
at Camp David of course we know the last
couple of years of his term of service
was filled with domestic and
international crisis and it engulfed the
latter part of his presidency and he
suffered a very bitter defeat for
re-election and then going home to
planes he found the family business in
tatters it was a bitter time
but being a man of faith
Jimmy Carter cried out to God and God
showed him a piece of wood
Jimmy Carter is a wonderful Carpenter
and God transformed his avocation as a
carpenter into an ambassador for Habitat
for Humanity building homes for the
homeless
and this is only the beginning of the
most prolific post-lude in United States
presidency which included a Nobel Peace
Prize Jimmy Carter
is a wonderful example of someone who
could enter the most bitter of waters
and make them better and we're praying
for president and Mrs Carter amen
in what appeared to be his last days
under hospice care may they be sweet
indeed
but in closing let us be reminded of
another Carpenter whose initials are JC
Jesus Christ entered into the bitter
Waters of this sinful world two thousand
years ago he came to embody and live out
the very laws of God that God gave us
and after three years of Earthly
Ministry he cried out in the Garden of
Gethsemane and God showed him a piece of
wood
a tree
an Old Rugged Cross
and facing that bitter cup
Jesus said not my will but thine be done
and in this season of Lent let us be
reminded of his sacrifice his blood shed
for us his life given for us that the
bitterness of sin but might be removed
and we might be forgiven
and just as the Israelites were three
days in the desert Jesus was three days
in the Tomb
but he rose victoriously over death that
we may experience the Living Water of
abundant life on Earth and eternal life
in heaven in the Sweet By and By Jesus
is the ultimate example of turning
something bitter into something better
and sweeter and that is why in the words
of the hymn writer Jesus is the sweetest
name I know
and he's just the same
as his lovely name and that's the reason
why I love him so for Jesus is the
sweetest name I know
would you join me in prayer
dear heavenly father I thank you for the
opportunity to speak to this
representative body for our state
180 seats filled with strong men and
women
bless them as they often serve against a
backdrop of bitter complaining and
blaming
yet help them to know that it is within
their reach to say something and do
something positive to transform bitter
Waters and make them better if not sweet
and help them to know that their
Collective potential to empower our
state and even our nation to do a 180.
and turn the people away from bitterness
and division toward goals that make us
all better
and we do thank you today for President
Jimmy Carter and his precious wife
Rosalind and their family as they count
down precious final days together may
you comfort them and help them to know
of our love
Lord bless our great state of Georgia
and God please bless these United States
of America in the sweet name of Jesus I
do pray it
amen
I pledge allegiance
of the United
Republic for which it stands one nation
under God indivisible with liberty and
justice for all

apologized
represent McDonald
to present the Bill thank you no words
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen the house I bring you House
Bill 163 a student loan repayment plan
for medical examiners this bill is a
much needed incentive to recruit and
retain medical examiners to the state of
Georgia
currently the state is staffed with nine
full-time medical examiners two
part-time serving a population of almost
11 million people
this is impacting every community in our
state
many of us have received calls asking
for help of some kind in resolving this
issue
these nine Georgia Pathologists are
carrying an overloaded caseload because
of the shortage this is not just a
Georgia problem this is a national
problem
the governor and the Georgia legislature
are now working together on bringing
resolve to this issue
this program is being administered by
the Georgia student finance Authority
and is included in the governor's
amended FY 23 and FY 24 budget
Mr Speaker I yield for any questions
you do have a question if the gentleman
yields generally else
representing Byrd from the 20th right
out in front of you has a question
representative Byrd
thank you very much this is gentleman
yield Jimmy yields is it not true all
student loan forgiveness is paid by
taxpayer money
that is true if the lady so States but
it's also this this loan repayment is an
investment back in our medical examiners
it's not it's kind of a bonus that that
stair stepped over five years that they
have to stay here and complete those
five years to be able to get the fleet
amount
and is it not excuse me for the yield
and is it not true that everyone outside
this gold Dome who has student debt
would like forgiveness as well if the
lady feels oh thank you
gentlemen yield for a question from
chairman
Bill Hitchens to your left
well gentleman yield yes sir is it not
true that uh in Georgia now we have no
forensic Pathologists in Macon or
Savannah and we're we're direly short
and it it inhibits the criminal justice
system for moving forward when you can't
get the evidence you know not only
inhibits that but it also hurts these
families they're waiting on their loved
ones to get back because the time that
it takes from traveling from Savannah
from Valdosta and the cost to those
communities we refer to you yes sir is
it not true that there are over a
thousand medical examiner positions in
this United States and there are only
500 certified forensic pathologists that
is true
thank you thank you gentlemen yield for
a couple more yes sir
the gentleman from the 172nd he's been
here a short time but he's uh has some
pretty good questions
Chase cannons recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield generally yes is it not true the
county coroners and the southern part of
the state have to drive or spend one or
two days or three days
transporting bodies to Atlanta rather
than to make it
as gentleman States yes is it further
not true does the gentleman yield yes
further not true that this this bill
would potentially lower the cost for
County coroners uh exponentially
the gentleman knows what he speaks
gentlemen yield to representative Al
Williams right out in front of you
representative Williams The Man From
Midway yes sir for the gentleman yield
yes sir is it not true that an
investment of this nature would return
greatly
the Forgiveness that's given
the gentleman knows what he speaks is it
not further true that many times the
huge delays and funerals and it's very
difficult because we've not been able to
get the information needed back from the
medical examiners and it's a desperate
situation and we certainly can't put a
dollar amount on this you're so correct
sir for your community it's it's good
doing this is going to change everything
in the state of Georgia and recruit and
retain these these medical examiners
let's hear a question from the gentleman
the chairman from which this issue arose
representative Martin has a question
gentleman yield for a question yes sir
isn't it true while this does uh involve
loan repayment the state is getting a
value for in in exchange for that yes
sir Jim know what he speaks for the
yield yes sir isn't it true that that's
quite a bit different from a blanket
loan repayment just because I went into
debt you owe us the money that is true
sir it is for the Yale yes sir isn't it
further true that the governor's plan to
do this and make it a loan repayment has
the money go straight to the loan
repayment rather than paying it to the
medical examiner so one couldn't take
that money and do something else and
still claim I have debt this is a direct
repayment for Val isn't it true this is
a direct repayment for Value to the
taxpayers of Georgia and is an
investment into this uh profession so
that Georgians can be better served that
is true and that's why it's going to
this Georgia student finance committee
so that that doesn't happen in this
these loans and or paid back and
protected
we have another speaker on this subject
a couple of questions out there but um I
saw the questions right now for you Mr
Floor leader so so uh we'll move on to
another speaker if you were if you will
yield the well Jim yields are well and
ask for your favorable consideration on
this very important issue thank you
floralita McDonald has yielded the well
my friend from the coast representative
Edna Jackson is recognized to speak to
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
to all of my colleagues that are here I
asked if I could speak to this bill
two weeks prior to Christmas
my first Grand nephew
was shot in the head
by a young man that wanted to steal his
car
his mother my niece
did not know about it
until later he was shot in the morning
but they didn't know we thought they
thought he was home sewing he was a
graduate of scared and was a designer
the only reason that we found out who
shot my grand nephew was because the
young man that took the car
was caught trying to change the plates
on the car but we thank God that he's in
jail
it took us
two weeks
two weeks before we could get a coroner
two weeks because they were not
available
not only that they had to take the body
from Savannah Georgia
to Macon Georgia and my niece wanted
that bod her her son's body buried
before Christmas that is why I'm asking
you to support this bill there are other
families car accidents where multiple
people are killed and they need to have
a coroner to declare the reason I ask
all of you
I never thought I would experience
something like this
and it's still hard on the family please
join me in voting to pass this bill so
that we can make sure that people that
are going into that area will have the
finances to finish their degree so that
our families will not have to suffer I
yield the well
the lady has yielded the well

sympathetic to your family's loss and
thank you for sharing that with us

on the line each day when we dial 9-1-1
police and firefighters have no
guarantee when they answer a call if
they will make it home safe or without
injury
EMTs must be on call 24 hours
to help rescue Georgians experiencing a
medical crisis and the pay for these
responders do not equal the risk they
take when answering the call to 9-1-1
the importance of the work of the First
Responders in Georgia should be honored
in a day of recognition and appreciation
each year on September the 11th a day
where residents can show gratitude and
support Community Heroes who answer the
call when they called 9-1-1 colleagues I

Mr clerk will you read the caption to
house resolution 96 H.R 96.
house resolution 96 by representative
Williams 148th and others a resolution
proposing an amendment to the
Constitution so to provide for a
reduction in the rate of ad valorem tax
assessments of Timber at sale or harvest
this resolution haven't been referred to
the committee on ways and means that
committee recommends that this
resolution be adopted
chairman Noel Williams is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'm colleagues I
rise today to talk to you about H.R 96
this past the house last year 166 to
zero and somehow it did not make it past
sunny day across the hall this is a fair
tax for Timber
standing Timber is the only agricultural
crop that is taxed for ad valorem tax
purposes at a hundred percent all we're
asking is this to be taxed at 40 percent
um this legislation is about uniformity
and fairness and this would be a
constitutional amendment so we would
need 120 green votes I hope we have more
than that and it will be on the ballot
in 2024 to be effective 2025 assuming we
have favorable favorable participation
from you all
with that Mr Speaker that's the genus
that's the Crux of this bill and I will
stand for any questions
gentleman has no questions but do we do
have another speaker you have no
questions thank you Mr Speaker and
colleagues I appreciate your favorable
consideration
well the Williams boys are working
together here let's see
uh-huh chairman Noel Williams
representative Noel Williams and now
representative Al Williams is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker especially for
recognizing the influence and power of
the Williams caucus
last year
I had the opportunity to speak about
this same bill
nothing really has changed
the fact is that it is needed
and it brings fairness into taxation
now I know that the feeling usually is
that
Timber owners
a huge very wealthy people
that's not always true
there are a lot of small Timber owners
where this tax really affects them
and like I told you last year one of
them happens to live in my district
and Miss Riles on several Acres
certainly would help her as a small
landowner
as an aside
until the 50s
the largest percentage of
African-American landowners in Georgia

use taxes
so to revive for a qualified
Consolidated Government special purpose

chairman Newton is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker House Bill 230 that
I bring to you today will allow the
voters in Augusta Richmond County to
vote on a house a half penny splas to
fund the construction of a new Arena our
current Arena entertainment venue is 45
years old and really functionally
obsolete it lacks any of the
infrastructure and amenities that you
need for touring shows the new Arena
will see about 10 000 people I know that
may be small around Atlanta but it's
pretty big in our region of Georgia and
this aligns with Augusta's Regional
reach the framework of this c-splus
mirrors the framework of splice for
other Consolidated Government but this
one is narrowly tailored and in
particular emphasizes the fact that
we're on a state border that is a key
point because this is a regional Arena
much of the benefit will be enjoyed just
across the river from downtown in South
Carolina a growing area of North Augusta
and Aiken South Carolina unfortunately
with property taxes and other ways of
funding there's no way for them to
really contribute to Something in
Downtown Augusta this would allow
Augusta Richmond County to do this will
be financed through revenue bonds there
may be some other there will be some
other Revenue sources including ticket
fees naming rights and things like that
it is supported by the entire delegation
from Augusta Richmond County and I'm
pleased to have that plus our Augusta
Richmond County Chamber of Commerce
supports I hope you'll uh join with me
and allow us in particular to allow the
beneficiaries of this new uh
infrastructure who are often out of
state members to help pay for the 40
percent that they'll be enjoying by
allowing us to do this half penny sales
tax in the Augusta Richmond County
consolidated government

House Bill 264 of Representative Smith
of 138th and others to be entitled not
to amend code section 48-5 311 of the
official go to George annotated relating
the creation of County Boards of
Equalization duties review of
Assessments and appeals this bill
haven't referred to the committee on
ways and means that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee
substitute
representative Vance Smith
is recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
ladies and gentlemen House Bill 264
deals with taxpayers when they have an
appeal process on their property tax
working with the tax assessors and the
clerks if you look at section two first
all the way through the bill worked on
all of those items the dates how many
days you're allowed is a 180 day period
some of the dates in there have been
adjusted to try to equalize and
adequately appoint that time for the tax
assessor's office and clerks and Board
of Equalization there's a the section
number one
it was an addition so that's the reason
you have a substitute but if you looked
at line 241 through 246 if if there's no
hearing officer or they don't get a
hearing schedule doing the required time
then that section one
item c will take effect and if you look
at that it will give a stipulation that
they will the taxes on the property
presently will remain there successive
for two years there are three exceptions
if they uh taxpayer has a valuation on
their return that's higher or different
or if the tax assessor goes out and
on-site visit looks at the property and
sees that there's been an addition
deletions to the property on
improvements to the property or if the
taxpayer himself presents evidence to
change that whether it goes up or down
so that's basically your bill I think
this will help the tax payers or speed
that process up by adequately adjusting
that time and I would certainly ask for
your favorable consideration thank you
Mr Speaker there are no questions I'll
heal the will
the gentleman yields he has a question
to your left yes certainly Jasmine Clark
has a question yes ma'am thank you Mr
Speaker this is gentleman yield yes
ma'am so um on in section two you say
that we're equalizing the time
um but it shows that we're actually
decreasing the amount of time that the
county has to I guess reach out to or
correct changes by half
how are larger counties like Gwinnett
and Fulton how do you think this might
affect them as they might have more on
their plate than maybe some of our
smaller counties
I think an equalizing that time and
there again the tax assessors and the
clerks work together
hand in hand on section two which that's
what you're talking about
but in some instances as I was
explaining some the tax assessors might
use of that 180 day period they might
use 130 140 days therefore leaving the
hearing officer or maybe a clerk of
court that lasts remaining 50 40 or 50
days so we're trying to make it even so
that they get as much time for the
hearing part as the tax assessors do um
and uh this gentleman for the yield yes
ma'am um also I think in the same
section
and line 104 where we change the
requirement for them to set a date for
hearing to them holding a hearing again
my concern is for the larger counties
now making it mandatory that they get
um
an actual hearing done in this amount of
time have you spoken to any of these
larger counties to see how they feel
this might affect their ability to just
do their job yes ma'am thank you for the
question there again the tax assessors
there was a meeting here at the Capitol
a few weeks ago and they sat down with
the clerks and they they worked out that
whole section too and they were all in
agreement now I'm not going to say
everybody in the whole State's
absolutely satisfied because I don't
know if we ever get Perfection but they
agree to those date changes
yes ma'am thank you representative Smith
will you yield for another question yes
sir
Whit burchett right in front of you has
a question if you'll yield
thank you Mr Speaker uh thank you for
bringing the bill representative Smith
just to for clarity's purposes
um isn't it true that 180 days is still
there it's just separated between the
Board of Equalization and the uh the
first first portion of the appeal
correct yes sir so you still got 180
days it's just uh which board has to act
under those 90 days and then
um isn't it also true that where before
the Board of Equalization had 15 days to
set a date now they have 90 days to hold
a hearing that was the that was the
change that
um in that section isn't that true
absolutely yes sir thank you mister I
appreciate that thanks for bringing the
bill
and that was on actually on line 103 it
went from 15 days to 90 days
if no further questions from the speaker
I'd ask you a favorable consideration on
House Bill 264.
the gentleman has yielded the well is

question being ordered chair here has

House Bill 227 by representative lever
to the 123rd to be entitled an act to
amend title 16 and the official quoted
George annotated relating to crimes and
offenses so survived for the offense
of criminal interference with critical
infrastructure this bill ever referred
to the committee on Judiciary non-civil
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative leverage
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen house I'm pleased today to
bring to you house bill 227 a bill that
addresses a very timely topic of concern
to all of us
I'm sure you all saw with me on the news
back during the December around the
holiday period when somebody is yet
unknown damaged a power substation in
North Carolina and plunged about 45 000
people into absolute darkness and cold
during one of the coldest times or cold
spells that I remember in my life
well that's not the only time that's
happening these days it's becoming more
frequent all over the country apparently
some people have decided that it's open
season on critical infrastructure in our
you for our utilities and they're using
that
um for whatever reason
we currently have some tools to deal
with that kind of conduct we have
criminal damage to property statutes and
we also have domestic terrorism
but of course not everybody does this
with an intent to be terrorism
terroristic to everyone there are times
when it's just simple damage and we
don't really know for example in North
Carolina if that was just two people
seeing who was the better shot and could
hit the shiny thing in the substation
with our shotgun or if it was truly
someone trying to call commit an act of
domestic Terror so House Bill 227
would address these issues by allowing
prosecutors a mid-range charge right now
domestic terrorism of course requires a
lot of proof elements with respect to uh
your your state of mind and your intent
your purpose
um domestic the criminal damage to
property statute does not require that
but it only has a penalty up to 10 years
so we're amending in House Bill 227 the
criminal damage to property statute and
adding some additional elements if you
can show that the damage to the property
involved critical infrastructure or
vital services and it was done
intentionally by force or violence or if
it was done to electronic infrastructure
by electronic means then that that
constitutes a special category of
criminal damage to property and first
degree and can be punished by an
additional 10 years it's two to twenty
years as a penalty so that's what the
bill does and I feel like this is
necessary at this point to send a
message to those who would try to damage
vital infrastructure which can have such
a more far-ranging impact than just
simply damaging a piece of property if
you if you damage the utilities
um you know truck Depot well that's
that's that's bad but that generally
isn't going to put 45 000 people in the
dark and absolute cold during right the
week before Christmas so this would
would give prosecutors an additional
tool in their toolbox if you will and
allow them to make a charge that has a
penalty that's commensurate with the
scope and breadth of the impact these
kinds of crimes have I think you may
notice on your desk there are quite a
number of organizations the Georgia
Chamber supports the uh this this
legislation as does a a wide group of
utility companies who are concerned
about this very alarming Trend and we
hope this will help send a message to
folks that might be contemplating that
that they don't should not do it and for
those who committed and aren't deterred
we can punish them to a degree that's
commensurate with the impact and the
harm they're causing to our citizens so
this will protect we believe this will
protect Georgia Citizens from these
kinds of Acts and will help deter them
so that's that's the bill uh Mr Speaker
I'll yield for any questions
gentlemen yields for questions the chair
recognizes representative Kennard to
your left for a question
this is gentleman yield I yield yes sir
has there been any been any incidents
like this in Georgia today I'm not aware
that there have been any yet but I
suppose my my goal is let's let's not
wait for a few of them to happen let's
try to be proactive and prevent them now
do you further yield yes sir so an 18 19
year old that accidentally hits a
critical piece of infrastructure just
shooting their gun what happens to them
well it's unintentional well if it's
unintentional the the bill does require
some kind of intent or intentionality
with that with the act so I don't
believe that would fall under this this
particular crime it might fall under
some others but not under this one thank
you thank you for that question
representative Earhart is recognized for
a question straight in front of you to
the back thank you representative we
yield for a question yes ma'am is it not
true that Georgia is an amazing place to
live and the number one state in the
nation to do business
yes ma'am I would agree wholeheartedly
will you further yield I will yield for
those this is a piece of legislation
that will provide a much needed extra
level of deterrent to protect this
amazing state that we live in and to
protect our citizens that is certainly
our intent yes ma'am thank you thank you
for the question
representative Collins chairman Collins
is recognized for a question if you will
yield for one yes sir
gentleman Neil yes sir absolutely is it
not true that throughout this state you
know there have been a lot of folks over
the years who have probably went on
power lines and went mudding and went
through the four-wheel drives and do
that kind of thing and it's not true
that this bill does a lot to discourage
that type of behavior and hold some
people more accountable for Reckless
Behavior Uh with with this type of
issues where you have people that might
be on a on a power line and they got
guns and they're shooting and and they
do damage to this type of critical
infrastructures it's not true that this
bill is going to help discourage that
type of behavior throughout this state
well I certainly hope it will
um and I think the degree of
intentionality that would require that
would suffice the support of prosecution
will have to be determined in each
circumstance based on those facts but I
certainly hope it will discourage any
kind of Reckless Behavior and certainly
intentional behavior that would would
damage that infrastructure
yield for a couple of more questions I'm
I'm trying not to Mr Speaker but I will
yeah if you don't mind take a couple
more representative Tran has a question
to your left
thank you Mr Speaker that's the
gentleman yield I do yes sir so as the
owner of a cafe in a shopping center
um I'm wondering critical infrastructure
if the bar in the shopping center couple
drunks get really drunk and they're
pissed off at the bar owner and they
knock out the Transformer and takes out
the entire shopping center would that be
part of critical infrastructure well
um Mr representative to me the bar would
be critical infrastructure
but I'm not sure it was not your
question
I'd be willing to accept that as
critical infrastructure no in all
seriousness I
given my personal preferences the
definition would not include the bar and
I believe again that it would get back
to the degree of intent
um and frankly I don't profess to have
enough knowledge of criminal law and
intent in in Maine Sharia to know but I
think if you are
drunk and commit an act like this you
probably wouldn't have the requisite
degree of intent but again I think it
depends on the totality of circumstances
thank you sir
and I look forward to visiting your Cafe
and trying out the other businesses in
the vicinity sometime soon sounds good
if the gentleman will take one more
question that would be awesome Mr
Speaker I would be delighted to do that
representative Maynor is recognized for
a question thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield yeah I yield yes ma'am
for the pleasure of the body I would
just like to point out that this is a
minimum of two years sentencing for
arsene of a police car it's a minimum of
five years sentencing for
two or more people to do a riot it's a
minimum of five years sentencing and
aggravated assault with the attempt
intent or attempt to rape
is one year if this body please
recognize that
thank you thank you
you have one last question and it's
representative donohoo over to your left
the gentleman from the 31st
there's a gentleman yield I yield is it
not true the worst whipping I think I
ever had when I was 12 years old I took
a 12 gauge shotgun I shot the power line
to control the telephone to my house
luckily my father worked for Southern
Belle and could fix that
but this builds a great bill because
with ill intentions we can hurt a lot of
people and I think it's very much needed
thank you thank you and I'm I'm sure the
representatives whipping was much worse
than two years in any any state
Institution
if the gentleman will yield I said one
more but this one's um I think this
one's important as well chairman Martin
to your right is recognized for a
question
you may have mentioned that but I want
to highlight it again if I may on line
36 of the bill you add electronic means
isn't that true yes and isn't it true
that we we found nationally and
internationally that's one of the
biggest vulnerabilities to our critical
infrastructure is cyber intrusion that
can take out not only forty thousand
people not a hundred thousand people but
could it potentially take out half of
the United States because of the
interconnection between the electric
grid and your address and that in the
bill and if for no other reason isn't it
true that's a great Improvement for the
protection of our citizens in Georgia
Thank You chairman Martin I would agree
wholeheartedly and I wish I could claim
credit for that great idea it was
brought to me after we filed the bill
but it seemed like such a good idea we
couldn't resist it so we did include
that in the in the bill that's before
you today for your approval thank you
for that question
done a good job all right if I have no
further questions Mr Speaker I will
yield the well and ask your favorable
consideration of house bill 227.
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair here has
done the committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair here is none the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and their clerk
will unlock the machine
for what purpose does WHIP Burchette
rise a parliamentary inquiry state tree
inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true that
dove hunting is one of the favor
pastimes in the state of Georgia
I've heard that isn't it also true that
this bill would help some of my friends
in south Georgia that can't hit them
flying from shooting them off the lines
I'm sure the Gentleman Just practiced
what he preaches from time to time
whether it be a friendly tree or a power
line no doubt about that
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
174 the Nays zero the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed Mr Clark If
you read the caption to House Bill
302 302
House Bill 302 by representative
Franklin of the 160th to be entitled an
actual man code section 16-5
94 of the official go to Georgia
annotated relating to restraining orders
and protective orders so to provide for
the issuance of a temporary or permanent
protective order by the court
disability refer to the committee on
judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
representative Franklin from down in
Statesboro is recognized to present the
bill
thank you Mr Speaker
this bill is to amend the code relating
to protective orders in regards to
stalking it basically gives the judges
the discretion at the time of its
ordering
to allow it to be temporary or permanent
at that time
and that is basically all that is to the
bill but I tell you as I started looking
into this I had no idea the frustrating
the frustrations surrounding this issue
and I've come to learn that many people
or many of us in this chamber have
actually dealt with it and if you
haven't dealt with it personally you
more than likely know somebody that's
dealt with this issue
um
so I feel like it's time that we do
something about it stalking in its core
manifests itself in intimidation control
and fear
um
and I think we could all agree in this
chamber that there's no place for that
in Georgia so as for your considerable
favorable consideration on this bill and
I yield for any questions you may have
gentlemen yields for questions
representative Kendrick to your left is
recognized for a question thank you Mr
speaker I yield
is it not true that unfortunately I have
been a
benefit of stalking in years past
if you suspect
um does the gentleman further you I do
is it not true that this would clarify
so that judges will be able to issue
permanent orders as opposed to Temporary
ones therefore are protecting people who
might have been victims of stalking like
myself that is absolutely correct thank
you
if I just may say a lot of the
situations that I've seen a lot of the
victims have had a temporary order and
they've had to come back to face their
accusers for an extension so this is an
attempt to try to solve that issue
[Music]
gentlemen yield for one more question
yes sir I yield uh leader restoration
right in front of you
he's recognized for a question if y'all
will turn his mic on I think Mr Speaker
gentleman yield I do sir isn't it true
that under the circumstance just
outlined by the representative a victim
of stalking can under current law only
petition for protection for 12 months
and your bill is necessary so that that
could actually be a permanent or at the
time it's issued and provide far longer
protection for that victim yes sir that
is correct thank you good Bill thank you
you have no further questions
with that of the other Yale yield of the
well the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is

House Bill 384 vice president of
Henderson of the 113th be entitled knack
to amend code section 3329 3.2 of the
official go to Georgia annotated
relating to individual accident and
sickness insurance coverage for
mammograms pap smears and prostate
specific antigen tests this bill ever
referred to the committee on insurance
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
representative Henderson has recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I am proud today to introduce HB 384
prostate cancer is the second leading
cause of death among men in Georgia
as you can see on the screen this year
alone over 7 000 men
will be diagnosed in the state of
Georgia
over 900 men will lose their battle
those numbers are astronomical
prostate cancer early on has no symptoms
and it has no pain
therefore it is very important
to get a PSA test done yearly
this bill HP 384
is where this insurance companies will
send notifications to men recommending
having a PSA test done upon reaching age
45.
having it done at age 40 if there's a
family history existing
as a breast cancer survivor myself I can
attest to the importance of early
detection
we all have men in our families that we
love dearly
and this legislation could save their
lives as a result of this legislation we
address you and we recommend that you
just encourage your family members to be
tested
my mission is to raise awareness that
early detection is key that early
detection save lives
early detection saved my life
so I say to you today men in the state
of Georgia please get your test done
don't hesitate make time out of your
busy schedule
and live a cancer-free life
and today I would be remiss if I left
this Podium without thinking

does my seat mate yield yes ma'am so um
is it not true that I never met my
grandfather because he passed away from
a very aggressive form of cancer
also my uncle died at a very young age
from a very aggressive form of prostate
cancer
and my father started getting his
screenings much earlier than what was
recommended
and because of that he was able to get
his uh prostate cancer he was also
diagnosed but he was able to get his
diagnosed early enough that he is now
being treated for and doing very well is
that not true it's great it's great
thank you
that's perfect proof that early
detection does save lives thank you
representative for that question later

only a page long it would establish the
commodity commission for citrus which is
a growing product in the state several
years ago it was only 11.5
million pounds produced in the State uh
over a few counties and last year
basically
looking forward into the next couple of
years 500
000 pounds of produce produced over 45
different counties in the state so it's
a very it's a growing product and the
Citrus Association has requested this
commodity commission so they can engage
in research promotion and education for
the product
um very low impact fiscally if any it's
a voluntary commission any fees would be
paid for for by the folks that
participate in the commission I
appreciate the the bill signers that
helped me carry this bill
uh it is my first bill and I'll yield to
any questions

about this subject so if you see if we
can give you a good question here
absolutely does a gentleman yield I
yield to my mentor
[Laughter]

is it not true that that
Georgia leads the nation when it comes
to college football
States I know if I want to speak yes sir
is it ought not also true that Georgia
leads the nation when it comes to
Satsuma production
the gentleman knows of what he speaks is
it not further true that the future
looks really bright for both our
football team and and our Satsuma
Growers going forward and we're going to
continue to squeeze our competition for
years to come
that is a little fruity question but I I
generally said States

representative Becky Evans has a
question I'm sure this is a good one the
lady is recognized
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I yield yes uh
isn't it true that one reason why
perhaps why our uh Georgia climate is
producing Citrus uh you know that we're
so good at producing Citrus now that it
might be that our climate is changing
here in Georgia the lady knows of what
she speaks yes
I'll yield yes yes and so isn't it true
that many of us in this body that our
state will
State can better prepare for climate
change that's happening
let it knows what she speaks thank you
gentleman yield for another question
I yield and I can peel the love tonight
well let's see how much love you get out
of this one
chair lady Houston has a question
uh parliamentary inquiry
oh State your inquiry isn't it true that
the speaker in the well is doing much
better answer his questions and his
predecessor did and Lita Beverly ask him
a question
General Lee knows what she speaks I
agree with that
we're going to take a couple more we
need
we had one that doesn't grow
satsumas let's see one from the back
chairman Carpenter I know he can't does
the gentleman yield I'm not sure this
question will be worth the squeeze but I
yield
as a lover of all things Georgia produce
is it not true that our very own John
Corbett's family grows what I believe
are the finest satsumas in the land the
gentleman is correct
German mix is recognized for a question
then I have one so don't leave the wheel
yet
thank you Mr Speaker just I yield I
appreciate you bringing this bill I was
just reading through it and I see that
we established the commission but
nowhere in the language do we appoint
anybody to be on the commission can you
confirm where that is within the bill
it's already in the statute uh the
breakdown is basically the Georgia Farm
Bureau president the uh
there's a member appointed by the house
in the Senate and also the agricultural
commissioner or his designee and then
those four would select five members
that large and serve on the commission
General year for one more equipment I
yield where is
chair has a question if you don't mind
gentleman yields where is this industry
located in Georgia that's it across 45
counties Mr Speaker and where are those
counties on the lower the lower part of
the state
half the southern part of the state
gentlemen yield I yield how far up in
Georgia do these counties exist
that produce this um uh as far north as
the Effingham County Mr Speaker
making sure making sure you knew that
Bullitt County and the Franklin's grow a
lot of a lot of these little precious
gems over there as well good job
gentlemen you've done a good job your
first time let's see how your vote comes
out Mr Speaker I yield the well
gentlemen has yielded the well
is there any objections to the previous
question being ordered the chair here
has none the previous question is
ordered is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair hears none the report
of the committee is agreed to shall this
bill now pass all in favor of the
passage of the bill will vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
for what purpose does chairman Martin
rise can you help him parliamentary
inquiry Mr inquiry appears the gentleman
needs some help is that not true that is
very true earlier isn't it true Mr
Speaker earlier in the uh
presentation the gentleman to my left
over here mentioned the proclivity of
the Georgia Bulldogs win national
championships and we're all proud of
that isn't that true Mr Speaker
the gentleman so States isn't it true
that if you're a Georgia Bulldog fan Mr
Speaker in general you hate most things
orange that would be Florida Tennessee
Auburn and Clemson
so isn't it further true that if the
gentleman would through a parliamentary
inquiry say that this group is going to
work on breeding a special
Satsuma Mandarin
fruit
that could be say more red he might see
less red isn't that true
I'm sure the gentleman believes when he
gets way out there that he believes what
he's saying anyway so we'll say it that
way
for what purpose does a gentleman from
the 16th representative Kelly rise
parliamentary requirements nature
inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true by
looking at the board the gentleman may
not have the juice to get this over the
finish line
I'm sure the gentleman looks it looks
correct anyway let's see we're going to
take one more Another Mountain guy maybe
two more two mountain guys
gentleman from the ninth representative
Wade I'm sure he's got something on this
one
uh parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry I just want the the sponsor of
the bill know that I'm very willing to
turn my
vote from red to Green if he could
enlighten me and if I miss it I
apologize the number of Georgians that
would qualify to be on this commodity
commission I know that the chairman
Smith wants to know how many Georgians
are impacted and I appreciate the
chairman and his effort to make sure
this is in the best interest of all
Georgians but I have no idea how many
folks live in those 45 counties that
would do this and if you want to tell me
offline I'll probably give you my green
vote
I hope you all will communicate
you know we're burning daylight y'all
but we're going to take one more
question
one more inquiry for what purpose does
representing Jason Ridley rice
parliamentary Inquirer State your
inquiry Mr Speaker is it not true that I
might need to take this young man and
teach him what reconsideration means
about looking at this board
[Laughter]
uh you have a reputation here for being
a great parliamentarian and I'm sure you
could probably help him
on the
government
have all members voted and so the
if all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine on
the passage of the bill the yeast were
172 the Nays zero
the bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
I've never had too much fun but that was
close
we're gonna go on to HB 273. we're going
to break here in just for a few minutes
in a few minutes so let's um let's move
on and give your attention
to uh HB 273 the clerk will read the
caption House Bill 273 by representative
DeLoach the 167th to be entitled knack
to amend article one of chapter 2 title
12 of the official to Georgia annotated
relating to General Provisions relative
to Department of Natural Resources so
it's extend the date by which rules and
regulations prescribed by the board of
Natural Resources must be in effect for
purposing purpose of establishing
criminal violations
this building refer to the committee on
natural resources environment that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
members this bill was on yesterday's
calendar
and we postponed until today and the
gentleman is patiently waited to present
the bill
chairman DeLoach is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker this mic was up
pretty high I don't know it was here
before me but it must have been pretty
told
this is a Natural Resources Department
of Natural Resources Bill section one
simply moves forward the date from
January 1 2022 to January 1 2023 so the
department can continue to enforce their
rules and regulations the section 2
deals with the cephalo island Heritage
Authority it's simply
changes the makeup of the authority very
slightly
it allows the gut the governor currently
serves and it allows the governor or his
or her designee to serve
on the board the commissioner continues
to serve on the board the executive
director of State Properties commission
continues to serve
formerly the commission on human
relations in the governor's office had a
seat and that Commission on human
relations in the governor's office has
gone away so we take that seat and give
it to a resident of the hog hammock
community on Sapelo Islands so they now
have two residents serving the only
other thing this bill does
is removes the governor as the chairman
of the authority and he becomes the vice
chairman and the commissioner of Natural
Resources becomes the chair with that Mr
Speaker I'm on yield of well and go to
lunch
you're a smart man but we do have a
speaker
to assist you before you go to lunch
chair recognizes representative Al
Williams to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
and I certainly thank the author for
this bill
on saplo Island
hog Hammett
is the last remaining
gullage
in the entire United States
for many many years the residents there
have been able
to identify themselves with a direct
lineage to the west coast of Africa
many many good things have happened
that's why it is a beautiful pristine
place
and the reason for this bill and the
reason for the commissioner becoming a
chairman as as the as the author said is
because the governor is just not able to
meet often enough
because of other responsibilities and
the commissioner and we have several
Rangers over there is able to do this
and the people over there need to be
heard
there are many things they need
and and as you know by our bill that has
been introduced also by the author
McIntosh County is economically a very
depressed area
and it is vitally important
the county is doing some things but it's
important that the state is able to hear
directly particularly from The
Descendants
of
saplo org Hamlin
I support this bill
there's no such thing as a perfect Bill
I've seen very few come out of this
house every once in a while we do get a
perfect one but there there are some
things that that
would have liked to have seen
but this is probably as good a bill as
we're able to get out of here and give
the kind of representation and audience
to the members of hog Hammett that is so
necessary when I first came to the
legislation I represented since Simon's
Island and I told some folk this morning
at that time there were 23 votes
on that island
I got 22 of them I'm still looking for
that one traitor but
this is an extremely important bill
and I asked for your support of it thank
you
gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair hears none a report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill will vote Yes all those opposed
will vote no and their clerk will unlock
the machine
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine on
the passage of the bill the yeas were
171 the Nays zero the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed one last
bill we're going to take up House Bill
244
Mr Clark where you're either caption the
house bill 244.
household 244 by representative Petrie
is 166 to be entitled an act to amend
chapter one and title 27 the official go
to George annotated relating to General
Provisions relative to Game and Fish
so it's extend the date by which rules
and regulations prescribed by the board
of Natural Resources must be in effect
for the purposes of establishing
criminal violations
this bill ever referred to the committee
on game fish and parks that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
the gentleman from the coast chairman
Petrie is recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen house bring your house bill
244. great to follow my good friend
representative Loach from the coast with
another Coastal bill for those of you
that weren't here in 2019 we were able
to pass the oyster mariculture bill that
year most of the provisions in here
relate to that but I want to go through
the bill try to very briefly explain to
you what's in here the first thing I
want to point out was an amendment made
in committee which is section 2 which
basically now will allow electronic
calls for hunting bobcat and fox in this
state that would be during season we
already have a season as most of you or
some of them maybe in more urban sites
may not be aware there are game species
and um we are going to expand and allow
electronic calling for hunting that game
animal when you leave that section you
go to the real uh
I kind of meat of the bill as it began
which relates to Coastal issues and
you'll see on lines 40 uh 45 to 48 there
what we're doing here Seafood dealers
have to report
to the Department of Natural Resources
Coastal Resources Division all of the
Harvest and the sales of uh uh
shellfish and shrimp things of that
nature all Seafood has to be reported
monthly to the department so they can
track
these these sales and populations we
have some
dealers who have decided that if they
don't have any activity they simply
don't have to report and of course the
conundrum for the Department is they
don't know whether they're not reporting
in violating the requirement or if they
actually have no activity at all so what
we do right here is make it very clear
that if you have no activity you still
have to monthly report that non-activity
so that is what we do in the first part
of the bill in section four we we re we
redefine cage so when I pass the
mariculture bill and here in 2019 what
we the the the industry generally uh
remember we grow oysters when we Farm
them in the intertidal zone in cages and
at the time we used individual cages the
new technology to use that term is that
we have a multitude of smaller cages
inside one aggregate larger larger cage
and so you see a change of definition
there in section five you see we're
basically dealing with our Master
Harvesters and then our Harvesters that
work under master Harvest Harvesters to
grow and harvest shellfish and what
we're doing here on line 81 you'll see
there here and then on the other section
as well we're changing shall Language by
the department to May language the
reason we're doing that is to give the
department the ability
to determine whether or not they need to
deny a permit or in the next section to
revoke a permit based on an infraction
there are smaller infractions the
department would not want to uh be
compelled to remove someone's permit for
so we're given discretion to the
department very important I poured out
point out however because we're talking
about oysters on line 85 to 87 you'll
see the Shou language remains on
certification from the Department of
Agriculture so anything that relates to
food safety those violations loss of
certification they would still lose
their permit and then finally section 7
Mr Speaker eliminates the cage fee
altogether and the original Bill we put
a one dollar fee on each cage and we're
eliminating that all together because of
the new system Mr Speaker that's as fast
as I can go through that bill and I'm
glad to answer any questions if I wasn't
clear in any way
I think you were clear but you do have a
question Representatives representing
sayings chairman Sainz from the coast
my good friend does the gentleman yield
I do indeed as this bill is vitally
important to the Vitality of Georgia's
Seafood industry would the gentleman
clarify that the best seafood in this
state can be found in the Golden Isles
wow
well at risk of uh let me do this at the
risk of losing your vote the best
seafood in this country can be found on
the Georgia coast we can agree on that
representative that's for certain
until we came up got to defining areas I
didn't have this question I've been
looking for it though
the gentleman knows probably more about
oysters than anybody in this house
representative Al Williams has a
question I will agree with that David
speaking with the gentleman yield yes
sir is it not true that this bill helps
resurrect the oyster harvesting business
in Georgia that for years has been
almost dominant yes sir I I believe that
to be true sir is it not further true
that there's never been a question that
best tasting oysters in America
are found on the coast of Georgia
representative you are correct and is it
not true that with this we will be able
to have an oyster that is even more
restaurant quality because we're not
known for our Beauty just our taste and
is it not true that
the Macintosh to the deserve at the
Ocean Air is picked in McIntosh County
by Ernest McIntosh
I believe that is true representative
and I I agree wholeheartedly with all of
your comments
Mr Speaker I have to take one more okay
one more and that's from another
gentleman from the coast
yet but um chairman DeLoach finish this
one off
this gentleman yield I do I do sir let's
get a little more specific if you don't
mind about oysters isn't it true
the finest delicacy that our creator
ever created is the Harris neck cluster
of small oysters
that is that is absolutely true
representative DeLoach Mr Speaker I'm
going to say one final thing the only
thing keeping us I want this body to
know this the only thing keeping us from
farming oysters today everything we
passed has been implemented is the Corps
of Engineers the federal government
delays are the only thing keeping us
from farming oysters today when they
finally do that this will be yet another
way to help us to continue to move
expeditiously to farm and oysters in
Georgia

Mr clerk while you read the caption to
House Bill 295 295.
House Bill 295 I representative Hawkins
the 27th is being titled an act two
amend title 33 of the official go to
George Anastasia related insurance so as
to revise certain procedures timelines
and other matters concerning consumer
protections against surprise billing
this bill I haven't referred to the
committee on insurance that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
the gentleman from Gainesville chairman
Hawkins is recommend recognized to
present the Bill thank you Mr Speaker
today I bring you house bill 295. you
know it was a few years ago this body
passed and the governor signed the
surprise Belling patient protection act
within that piece of legislation
arbitration was developed between the
patient and the excuse me between the
provider and the insurer which took the
patient out of the dispute which then
eliminated those costly medical bills
that would arrive six and eight months
later
the bill you have before you today HB
295 was drafted at the request of the
Department of Insurance to address some
of the issues occurring in the
administration of the arbitration Act
this legislation primarily does six
things one it extends a response dates
for the arbitration Center sections from
30 to 60 days
it also addresses the failure of the
insurer to designate whether the health
care plans are subject to the erisa
jurisdiction this is important because
if it's narissa plan then the
arbitration goes to the federal side if
the non arrest of the arbitration stays
in the state and is judicated by DOI
it also clarifies that ensure payments
are made directly to the provider or
facility within 15 working days when a
submitted electronically and 30 calendar
days for paper claims this is presently
in Georgia Code already
it also addresses the issues of
notification for complete payment this
is important because it that is the
trigger that starts the arbitration
when the provider challenges the payment
or the denial or procedure by the
insurer
it also creates penalties for failure to
respond to the DOI requests this is for
insurers and providers
and finally it provides
for doi to develop future policies to
ensure and improve the arbitration
process
this legislation is a result of several
meetings over the summer and fall
which represented there were insurers
providers hospitals and the Department
of Insurance
and through thoughtful deliberation all
parties agreed to this carefully warded
piece of legislation
so legislation is very important to
strengthen the surprise billing and
patient protection act and I ask for
your support and vote on this bill
if there are no questions Mr Speaker I
will yield the well you have no
questions and the gentleman has yielded
the well
foreign
objection to the previous question being
ordered chair here's none the previous
question is ordered is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill
the chair hears none the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass
all in favor of the passage of the bill
we'll vote Yes all those opposed will
vote no and the clerk will unlock the
machine
for what purpose does
chairman Collins rise parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry is it not
true that several years ago when I came
into the house there was a brilliant
legislator from Columbus that started
this and wanted to push to end surprise

the war to communicate and it also
provides for penalties if the guard if
the guardian fails to violate any of the
obligations and
this concern was brought to me by my

like Silk the gentleman's recognized
thank you
thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you
Mr Speaker ladies and gentlemen House
Bill 453 is a small business bill that
eliminates an annual license fee paid by
all ambulance services here in Georgia
the annual fee they pay is 2500 per
company 15 or 1400 per ambulance for
nearly 20 years uh this program was
designed to work as a provider fee
similar to hospitals and nursing homes
where ambulance services would Reserve
would receive matching funds in the form
of additional Medicaid reimbursement the
unfortunate reality is this hasn't taken
place and so uh we are asking this body
to eliminate the fee uh moving forward I
should mention as we we recognized
earlier today uh today is EMS day of the
capital and I can't think of any better
way to recognize uh such valuable
services in our community than passing
this legislation I'll tell you all
Industries in Georgia are facing a
Workforce shortage right now in this uh
passing this bill will provide valuable
funds back to our small businesses to
better serve our communities and keep a
safer health here Georgia and with that
Mr Speaker I will yield for questions
you do have a question
representative Al Williams is on a roll
also he has a question a gentleman's
recognized thank you Mr Speaker with
gentleman yield yes sir
I understand the reasoning and it's
reasonable
but will any of these if we cut the fees
out will innovate be reflected with at
least a token show of reduction in
ambulance bills
I think we had a uh I want to say we had
a surprise billing Bill earlier and and
I hope that begins to do that you'll
need to talk to my colleague to my left
on on how he can reduce those fees for
us
all right sir

Mr clerk if you read the caption to
House Bill
348 348
House Bill 348 by representative Collins
the 71st being titled back to amend
chapter 14 and title 40 the official
quoted George annotated relating the use
of speed detection devices and red light
cameras so to provide for standards for
sign warnings of the use of automated
traffic enforcement safety devices as
Bill Levin referred the committee on
motor vehicles that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee
substitute
chairman Collins is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker House Bill 348 has
been a work in progress for quite some
time ladies and gentlemen this deals
with the automatic
traffic enforcement devices what I would
refer to as the school camera
uh bill or devices that capture someone
who exceeds the speed limit in a school
zone
it's a good program that I really feel
like we need to keep in place because we
need to make sure and protect our school
zones from Speeders during the
appropriate times one of the things that
we're addressing in this piece of
legislation
currently right now we have a lot of
districts that are running these devices
all through the day and we want to bring
some guardrails in place this
legislation if you pass it today ladies
and gentlemen it'll only allow these
school zones to be enforced with this
traffic device for 30 minutes before the
bell rings in the morning 30 minutes
after the bell rings in the morning so
there's an hour in the morning
there's an hour in the afternoon 30
minutes before dismissal 30 minutes
after school has been dismissed so
there's two hours a day also we're
providing some more transparency in this
piece of legislation before these
cameras can operate and be enforced you
have to have the lights flashing have to
have the yellow lights flashing there
has to be a warning sign notifying those
folks that they're coming into that area
so it's not something that's going to be
used and abused throughout the day it's
going to be specifically timed to be
used in operation now for some of you
back home who have a school like my in
my district
I have a campus that is bisected by a
city street and I have a carve out in
here if you have a campus that's
bisected by by a city or county Street
and you have students and faculty
that'll be going to be going across uh
that street during the hours of school
you can run these cameras during that
time but again they have to be yellow
lights flashing there has to be signage
that warns you of that the other piece
of this piece of the legislation I think
is very important is we have had an
outcry I know many of you have from a
lot of folks who have purchased cars
where the previous owner did not pay the
Civil monetary penalty and there was a
lien on the title so the folks that
bought the car or you traded a car to a
dealer and didn't clean up these these
fees the person who bought the car had
to do that I spoke with a gentleman this
morning down in south Georgia who told
me he spent thirty thousand dollars of
his money from an auction house clearing
up titles on cars that came through his
auction house so this cler this cleans
up a tremendous piece of tremendous
loophole that we're going to be able to
go back home and say that we fixed the
other thing that this does it also caps
those fees associated with those civil
monetary penalties at twenty five
dollars my good friend Jason Ridley had
a piece of legislation earlier in the
week uh that that tightens down on that
but this also does the same thing it
caps those administrative fees
processing fees at 25 dollars
so Mr Speaker with that I will be glad
to answer any questions it's a good
piece of legislation that's been thought
through uh vetted through committee a
couple of times and I think it's a good
public policy that we can all go home
and be proud that we fix something that
needs to be fixed
gentleman yield for a question yes sir
to your left chairman Parsons has a
question yes sir
thank you speaker gentleman yield yes
sir isn't truth I've just gone through
the bill here I had I had not read it
before now and I'm in complete agreement
with you as far as the school zones and
then the time period that they it could
be in effect I think what 30 minutes
before and Thursday yes sir and I've
looked through and uh based on what I
just read and what you have presented
there are no other changes to regarding
the school bus stop arm camera other
than what you have presented just now is
that true right I meant to mention that
too thank you for bringing that up in
section 10 of the bill uh we're just
codifying there also if you if you don't
do not pay that civil monetary penalty
for overtaking a school bus your
registration cannot be renewed uh and
and there's no lien on the title so
we're making those both uh the same all
right thank you sir yes sir thank you
representative Buckner to your left has
a question Charlie the ladies recognized
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes ma'am to my friend I do I
heard you say that when someone went to
purchase a car that if someone owed back
um for tickets and things that the the
the the dealer had to pay that big
business at the auction house so how's
that going to be resolved in the future
with this bill I'm having trouble
finding that well uh what's going to
happen is is if you have a civil
monetary penalty that's issued and you
have a a hold on your registration
meaning you cannot renew your
registration if you have not cleaned
that up so you know the thought behind
that was if someone trades that vehicle
that that person that uh that obtained
that car whether it's a auction house or
an individual they're not responsible
for that
does the gentleman further you yes ma'am
so does that mean that the locals don't
get those fines or and it gets cleaned
up that way or they find the person well
unfortunately uh it's been my experience
looking at this uh you know most people
don't trade cars on a regular basis so
that that's going to be the the way that
we enforce this uh I guess I I want to
say that if someone doesn't pay this
then it basically just drops off of that
registration
okay
it's not a perfect fix but it's a fix
gentlemen you go for one more question
one more question then I know the day is
getting late and this is representative
Al Williams is recognized for a question
gentlemen yield to my friend yes sir is
it not true that I'm holding a picture
that my wife sent me
she can get a little heavy footage but
she got this speeding cost me a hundred
dollars
and it's 11 34 in the morning and a
school zone so if this passes can I get
75 of that money back
there's nothing there's nothing in the
building here that's retroactive but uh
we we can always come back next year and
look at something
Mr Speaker that's all I have about this
bill I would ask for this body's
favorable consideration and thank the
members who have given me positive input
in making this bill what it is I yield
will
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute
chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of

the committee is agreed to shall this
bill now pass all in favor of the
passage of the bill will vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk

the bill the yeas were 168 the Nays are
zero the bill having received your
requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed
foreign
will you read the caption to house bill
404-404
House Bill 404 by representative
Carpenter IV and others to be entitled
an act to amend chapter 7 title 44 the
official go to Georgia annotated
relating to landlord and tenances to
provide for a duty
of habitility for certain rental
agreements to provide for an exception
to such Duty and to provide for an
exception to the landlord toward a
liability
this bill I haven't referred to the
committee on Judiciary that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
chairman Casey Carpenter is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house I come before you
to present house bill 404.
the safe at home Act is a measured step
to ensure that tenants across Georgia
have certain rights written into Georgia
code for the first time
before I go into this bill I want to
explain a little bit about my childhood
growing up in Whitfield County
my family moved 16 times in 18 years
we on sometimes we rented it but we
rented a lot when I was 17 we spent a
three-month period around Christmas
without heat
so I understand the issues that tenants
face but I also understand the
issues that landlords face
this bill seeks to balance the interest
of both while admitting that livability
is a foundational piece of a tenant
landlord relationship
House Bill 404 creates a warranty of
habitability For the First Time In
Georgia code
it makes it clear that when elise's
signed the housing must be fit for human
habitation and it must be maintained
throughout that lease
House Bill 404 also provides the right
to cure to tenants across Georgia
this provision will provide tenants with
a three business day chance to pay their
rent
while I feel that most landlords provide
a grace period now this would ensure
that individuals are given some time to
to rectify and and find necessary funds
to pay their rent
it would also require that such notice
be tacked to the door and delivered by
any agreed-upon manner in the rental
agreement
House Bill 404 also caps security
deposits in the state of Georgia
for the first time across the state of
Georgia we have a cap of two months in
this legislation
we all want to see that the families
have the financial ability
to move into safe and stable housing My
Hope Is that the horrific stories of
school children living at Extended Stays
for extended for years on end will be
remedied by this cap
finally House Bill 404 seeks to ensure
that when a tenant is going through the
eviction process the air conditioning
cannot be turned off
this bill is an important piece of
legislation to begin a conversation
about about what rights We Believe
Georgia's tenants have
obviously we all understand that stable
and safe housing is Paramount for the
children of our great state
I think it's also important to
understand that not all landlords are
bad
many in fact go above and beyond the
measures that we're addressed in this
bill
but my hope and hopefully your hope is
to address the Bad actors that give
landlords a bad name and the Bad actors
that Prey Upon the least in our state
I look forward to your support on this
bill and I will be glad to take any
questions
gentlemen yields for a question
representative hugely to your left has a
question representative hugley is
recognized thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield yes ma'am thank you for
this important legislation in your uh
evaluation of this problem did you all
address when there's a dispossessory
um
eliminating the possibility that
landlords just put people's stuff out
all over the
all over the the front yard uh causing
harm and distress to other people who
live in those neighborhoods uh I mean I
think that's already addressed in code
but this bill did not address that no
ma'am
gentlemen further yield yes sir
representative yokoye is recognized for
a question
thank you Mr Speaker that's gentleman
again absolutely all right
um is the cap on the deposit two months
or three months two months it was the
original legislation was three through
the process the Judiciary through
multiple hours in the Judiciary
Committee we we changed it
thank you thank you
representative Maynor has a question to
fuel yield representative Maynard to
your right real quick speaker you notice
that I know where everybody sits when
you sit in the back you see where
everybody's at so I'm already I don't
have to look for you I know where you're
at well I was wondering if you're paying
attention to what we do in this house
barely just barely
every now and then when it's convenient
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield absolutely I have a few questions
for my friend and I want to just make
sure I'm reading this correctly so if
someone does not pay their rent within
three days
they can go to court and the process
they will be evicted instead of
immediately is that what it says that's
correct it basically it's three business
days right so you have three business
days once you've been notified hey you
didn't pay your rent which you should
probably already know but anyway once
you've been notified that you that your
your rent was due and it wasn't paid it
provides you with a three business day
grace period before that process can
begin and what was the number before
zero
zero days correct yes ma'am so this is
the first time in Georgia code that
you've established this grace period so
right now landlord does the gentleman
further yeah absolutely yep
um so before landlords were giving Grace
periods
um like being nice yeah so some some
landlords gave Grace periods and that
would still remain right this doesn't
eliminate the landlord's ability to
provide great spirits this just says
that in the state of Georgia we're going
to require you to at least provide a
three business day grace period if you
will thank you and does the gentleman
yield for one more question yes ma'am
so right now I love that you have in
here that the landlords must keep the
premises up to date
um or in good repair
what does the bill do for the landlords
that do not do that that would be a
breach of the contract that would
provide the tenant with the ability to
exit the lease
thank you thank you
chairman Prince has recognized for a
question go right to left
yes sir
is it not true that this
grace period that you spoke of will not
affect late fees
for the for the uh the renter of this
property that's correct it doesn't
address the fees obviously when you
rinse late you rinse late but it does
just say look give these folks three
three business days to help before the
process begins of eviction because once
that process begins it's hard to get
that it's hard to remedy
and it's and it's really a Scarlet
Letter moving forward uh as you as if as
you try to rent other housing
representative fry right in front of you
two years do Republicans have any
questions I'm just kidding hey Mr Frye
good to see you Spencer Hey this is kind
of one-sided here
I'm kind of feeling like I'm under
attack there go ahead my friend
does thank you Mr speakers gentleman you
know absolutely
um just to clarify you said that is
there a clause in there that talks about
not turning the heat off yeah all that's
already in code so the cooling piece was
a was a clarification many felt that
that was already the case but we we felt
it was important to solidify that okay
is the gentleman further you yes sir I
just want to thank y'all and thank the
speaker for bringing this legislation
there's a lot more work isn't it true
there's a lot more work that we need to
be doing to protect our tenants from uh
out of state predatory landlords and uh
thank you very much like most items
there's always more we can do
where your wish will be fulfilled here
chairman sayings to your left has a
question sir headed down to the coast
thank you Mr Speaker I'm glad I qualify
for uh his request does the gentleman
yield absolutely is it not true that um
I'd be hard-pressed to find a member of
this house who shows more care and
compassion throughout his day than the
gentleman at the well and that this bill
accurately reflects that to the George
to the housing needs of Georgians all
across the state I appreciate that
agree with a compliment thank you sir
representative Roberts is recognized for
a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes ma'am isn't it true that I do
believe these are steps in the right
direction and I appreciate the bill but
you did also agree to change it to
conditioned Air instead of cooling
because that did and I will work on that
I understand I just want to make sure I
got you on the record thank you so much
we're getting a hurry thank you
love it when we work together
chair recognizes representative olalier
for a question
thank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman
you yes sir
representative appreciate all of your
work and Leadership and pushing this
forward we've talked about some of the
imperfections
I wanted to ask you could you speak
further to the definition of
habitability I know that you put in some
some hard work to to make that clear but
could you speak a little bit too yeah
yeah so we wanted to leave it uh open to
the judges at this point we were afraid
if we started getting into specifics
then it would we're running and actually
derail the bill and so we feel like it
we felt like it was important to leave
that open so that it would allow the
judges to make those decisions
thank you yes sir
representative McCullum
left in the back thank you Mr Speaker I
want to thank you for this bill
um I have you beat I moved about 22
times growing up around in my county and

landlords are valuable
tenants are valuable
tenants are not an inferior class they
deserve the same respect of decent
living conditions like everyone else
a while ago I made a promise
I promise the citizens of my district
a district
that has a high rental rate like many
others of well over 60 percent that I
would help be a part of the solution
along the way with the support of people
inside of these walls and outside
and the continued collaborative effort
we have all had constant efforts
conversations and bills drafted to come
to a solution
thank you Mr Speaker chairman Carpenter
for the collaborative effort and thank
you for hearing the concerns of so many
in this body looking for a solution to
tenant rights and landlord rights
from citizens who have been forced to
stay in terrible living conditions in
their rental homes to landlords needing
their voices heard as well this bill is
the first step in the right direction
when it comes to improving the quality
of life for Georgians across this great
state so Mr Speaker chairman Carpenter

bill I haven't referred to the Committee
on Public Health that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
thank you Mr Clark chair recognizes
chairman Todd Jones to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues I want to talk to you today
about aspirational thinking and about
where and why
not only did we think about running for
office but why we did and why we sit
here today
why it is we convene why does it we talk
policy and why it is that we have
discourse and also agreement
we think about the 10.7 million citizens
that are within the state of Georgia and
we think about what is the best path for
us to be able to assist them
we know a fundamental fact about this
state and that's 80 percent of every
Georgia family is impacted by either
mental health or substance abuse
every day
each of us is getting phone calls every
day each of us is getting emails and
every day each of us are getting
requests from constituents asking us
what can I do
I don't know where to put my son
I don't know how to help my daughter and
I don't know how to make sure my cousin
is accounted for
there's no place for me to put them
my son's been in rehab three times my
daughter's been there too
these are the things that we hear as
representatives and I know that our
friends across the third floor hear the
same thing
every day when we come here for the 40
days and I hope the nine months that we
sit aside and think to ourselves what's
the best thing that we can do for the
state of Georgia
we know that 80 percent of the families
in this state are struggling
they need a place to turn
they need to know that we're there for
them
so we put ourselves into the public
Arena
president Teddy Roosevelt told us about
that
he said it's better to get into the
arena it is better to toil that it's
better to fight it is better to have the
conversations that are needed in order
to be successful
it's better to sweat
bleed
toil
and get to where it is that we need to
get to and whether or not you won or
lost the fact is we got on the field
to not get on the field is to absolutely
worst thing we can do so the question
becomes is do we let the perfect be the
enemy of the good
1013 got us halfway there
it's like building the pyramids we got a
foundation 520 gets us a little further
we got to Everest to first base camp
Let's Get Closer to the second base camp
and that's what 520 does
520 gives us the opportunity to look at
things that we didn't have the
opportunity to before 10 13.
it sounds simple we need a bed study
who thinks we need a bed study why would
you think in 159 counties with 10.7
million people we need to study beds but
we do
we don't know the type of beds we have
we don't know the workforce that aligns
to that bed
we don't know the rates we don't know
the conditions we don't know things and
we need to know that and section 6 does
that for us
we have to take care of all Georgians
that come into our Stead
there is data that exists across all of
our agencies the entire alphabet soup
but the question becomes is data sitting
idle is data that does not help us
we need to look at that data we need to
understand the analytics that can give
us the Predictive Analytics but most
importantly the care
a child within defects is not a child
that basically has the ability to go out
to the doctor and find out can I get all
your records
defects is the last point
Mom and Dad aren't there grandma and
grandpa and uncle and all the cousins
aren't there for that child so the
question becomes is where is defects
turn
how do they get the records that they
need
we can't have the agencies basically
getting into a squabble in terms of
whose date it is who should get it who
should see it absolutely not and this
bill will absolutely ensure that that
data is catered to so little Johnny or
Little Sally is going to be able to be
taken care of by defects within our
state
it is super critical that we understand
a very small population within this
state
you will hear the phrase familiar
phrases pardon me familiar faces a
hundred times
these familiar faces are absolutely
critical to us getting mental health and
substance abuse under control in this
state
I can't give you exact numbers but they
probably make up point one percent of
that population but they probably take
50 percent of the resources of this
state so the question becomes is do we
let it just keep going do we kick it
down the street or do we say no
we're going to do a study that's it
a study
we're going to try and understand how
all these agencies how health care the
Department of Corrections law
enforcement can work together
can come together and know that we're
going to have the ability to understand
this population better than we ever have
known this population and what can we do
to help them
so yes in this bill
we ask the agencies we asked the doc we
asked law enforcement we asked health
care we ask a series of different
departments to come together and say
What's the definition and what could be
some of the pathways to help the
familiar faces
because ultimately when President
Roosevelt's asked when President
Roosevelt asked us
do you want to get into the arena will
you get into the arena the question
becomes is
I know so many of you so well I know me
and I think you're like me
I'd rather be on the field than lose
than win by forfeit
so to me
I hope that you can have a favorable
consideration of this bill but most
importantly I hope you know that getting
onto the field today means we got into
the arena
we got into the arena to fight and we
got into the arena to be able to make
sure that we perfect this
not just for the people in this chamber
and the families that touch us every day
not just for our constituents and the
Senate's constituents and the governors
but rather to make sure that today and
tomorrow Georgia is taken care of
to make sure that the foundation that
we're going to create with 520 getting
us up just a little bit further up the
pyramid is going to be there for each
and every one that comes through Georgia
today and tomorrow
colleagues I ask you for your favorable
consideration of this bill
and I'll yield the well to Mary Margaret
Oliver
the gentleman has yielded the well
representing Mary Margaret Oliver is
recognized
thank you Mr Speaker
well chairman Jones brings a lot of
passion to this issue and I'm grateful
for that passion I'm also grateful for
all of the other contributors that have
come forward really in the last two
years to make Georgia move forward to
allow Georgia to move forward to serve
the families who face the crisis of
mental illness every day
it I think it'll be helpful I hope it'll
be helpful to those who are new here but
also to those who participated with us
last year in 1013 to do a very short
review
of the progress we made as you know
about two years ago the Behavioral
Health commission
chaired by Kevin Tanner became an
intensive through subcommittee action to
develop a legislative proposal for your
consideration in 2022 and ultimately
1013 passed in 2022 unanimously
bipartisan obviously by both Chambers
speaker ralston's leadership was
critical
let me say that again
speaker ralston's leadership was
critical
and speaker Burns has stepped forward in
a very strong way in a way that's been
enormously encouraging again in a
bipartisan way to bring additional
reforms and additional helps to the
families of Georgia
in 1013 you called for the appropriation
of grants for assisted outpatient
treatment for that population that
circles between the ER the jail and the
street those guys across the street from
our chamber right now are part of that
intensive population five assisted
Outpatient Treatment programs have been
funded across the state all of which
have been in rural areas
your support in 1013 for co-responder
programs which allows mental health
professionals to go out with law
enforcement has grown from about 15
teams to 49 teams funded again through
1013.
you know Justice Boggs chief justice
Michael Boggs of the Georgia Supreme
Court has become a national leader on
the issue of this jail Criminal Justice
Reform jail homeless ER population and
number of the matters that we are
talking about in 520 today our
contributions he has made based on
grants he has brought to Georgia based
on this leadership
if you look at a number of different
proposals to do a study to do an
analysis and to report by December 1st
all of that relates to accountability
it relates to accountability from our
state agencies and in every case where
we've asked for these reports in this
work we have gotten cooperation from
State agencies I want to applaud those
agencies for working with Advocates and
working with the commission to come
forward and say we need this work effort
we will be accountable and because it is
in this statute we will be able to
receive grants again national grants and
funding and give to you a good product
to take the next step
for instance in 1013 we funded a study
of Transportation we've heard so much
from the sheriffs about the difficulty
of transporting mentally ill folks in
and around these emergency crisis
situations based on that report that
came forward commissioner Tanner is
implementing a pilot program in
Southwest Georgia because that is an
area where they need the most based on
1013 we reported on for the first time
although we had statutorily called for
it several times a prescription
formulary that now gives us the
opportunity to understand in our
procurement contracts how families can
be treated we represent to you a report
of progress based on 1013 and 520 is the
next step
through the study subcommittee process
of the Behavioral Health commission all
of the meetings from this summer and all
the reports are available to you online
we come to the realization that I think
everyone in this body knows that
Workforce is our biggest challenge
in 520
Section 3 beginning on page eight we
talk about the Staffing level analysis
that must be conducted in relation to
the salaries we are paying our Mental
Health Service delivery folks it's about
20 percent vacancy rate right now across
the state along with that
Staffing level we also have an
Appropriations process going forward
that tells us about the Medicaid
reimbursement rates that we are
analyzing that will be a part of the
steps forward on section 12
we're asking the governor's health
strategy commission headed by Grant
Thomas
to take the 25 to 35 different specific
recommendations our Workforce study
committee made for licensing board
reforms and make an analysis by December
as to what statutory changes we must
make to make our licensing board more
friendly
more modern and more workable for the
mental health professionals across the
state that's section 12 on page 20.
section 14 on page 22 offers to nurses
and other mental health professionals
the same opportunity that's provided for
doctors across the state and 13 other
health care providers to perform with
them an alternative disciplinary process
if a professional license holder has
found himself or herself in trouble
perhaps by substance abuse or perhaps by
depression they can voluntarily enter
into an alternative disciplinary program
to protect their license keep them
working and serving Georgians but also
pay for they will pay for it the
monetary monitoring of their treatment
process this has been enormously
successful in the doctor community and I
believe it will extend the professional
lives of many other professionals like
nurses and clinical social workers
we also in section 19 on page 38 are
expanding the loan forgiveness program
for mental health professionals who are
serving Georgia Citizens today last year
in 1013 we created an educational loan
forgiveness program for students and
this year we're extending it to
professionals
1013 has been a success for folks in
your District
I believe and I hope that you will join
with us in me making the promises of
1013 accountable
but 520 is essential for us to move
forward for additional services and
additional accountability the taxpayers
of Georgia expect us to apply when we're
delivering delivering service to
families in crisis
I am very grateful for all of your
contributions we've made many changes to
this bill and will continue to listen to
you and understand what your priorities
are and I thank you for the opportunity
to do this work
Mr Speaker I am happy to answer
questions and Mr chairman Jones I'm sure
we'll be willing to do so also
but we'll allow you two to work together
to answer any questions we do have one
question a couple of questions at this
point chair recognizes representative
Kenner
Kennard for a question to your left
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentle
lady and gentleman yield
isn't it true that most who abuse
substances of drugs and alcohol are
doing so
because there's an underlying mental
health condition that's untreated
and therefore substance use is not
really a criminal issue it's a health
issue and isn't it further true that a
lot of people thousands in our
correctional system are not inherently
wrongdoers they are simply ill
I I want to recognize another area where
George is yes is to answer your question
another area where Georgia is a leader
in peer specialist and this bill
addresses specifically a greater
participation in peer specialists in our
leading our changes the co-diagnosis of
mental illness and substance abuse is a
real issue for the gentleman outside on
the street and in our jails and in our
ers
Based on data we know Circa 80 to 85
percent is due to that in terms of dual
diagnosis mental health being the
underlying issue in terms of
self-medicating in terms of what we see
from them so I would concur in terms of
that and then I think also the data
shows us in all 50 states unfortunately
the doc or I'll say the criminal justice
system has become the biggest provider
of either substance abuse or mental uh
health services so thank you will you
yield for one more question please
isn't it true that I am and we are
eternally grateful for your work on this
issue and it's an honor to serve with
you in this chamber thank you
representative Byrd is recognized for a
question straight in front of you
thank you very much do you yield
is it not true you just stated 80 of
Georgian families have mental illness
uh no ma'am
um representative bird what I said was
approximately 80 percent of the families
in Georgia face a mental health or a
substance abuse problem
so that would mean 80 percent of
Georgians no well 80 percent of the
Georgia families have either a mental
health or a substance abuse issue yes so
should all of them behold into G facts
uh representative Byrd I was using
defects as as an example uh what I was
trying to get at was we have a myriad of
data and a volume of data within the
I'll just say number of alphabet soup
agencies and what we're trying to do is
make it where we have that data sharing
that allows us to be better customer
service and better service to our
constituents that was an example to be
able to provide you where the rubber
would meet the road in terms of that
application and I use defects as an
example but I'm happy to give you a DC a
DCH a dbhdd example there's several
other examples that I could provide
offline
and do you further yield
yes
regarding um loan forgiveness
this body normally would say excuse me
Bernie Sanders would call this
socialists when we wanted to give away
student loans but yet we are doing this
in the state of Georgia thank you
is that a question ma'am
you have another question let's see
representing Maynor
is recognized for a question
Mr Speaker does the great two
legislators yield for a question
okay these are easy questions I
appreciate the bill and this is really
so I can go back to the people that also
support mental health I can answer those
questions for them so under each
different section when it's listing
different professions so for example
572-579 it basically says that we're
gonna practice HIPAA and then in
582-585 it says we won't hold these
individuals liable but it since it does
say on 584 if performed in accordance is
that basically saying that um
this statute says we must practice these
HIPAA guidelines and if someone does not
practice the HIPAA guidelines they then
in turn would have given up their
immunity to liability
about the alternative disciplinary
process in section 14 and 15 am I
correct yes those sections mirror
exactly the alternative disciplinary
process that set forth in for doctors
and 13 other professionals and the
immunity deals there with exactly what
tracks the federal HIPAA language I
think that every every time we've talked
about data sharing in this bill and and
other bills we always cite specifically
the Paramount Authority requirements of
HIPAA and the code of federal
regulations so I don't think there's an
inconsistency in the way we've set it
out
okay so just for clarity I'm I'm
agreeing with you but I just want to
make sure I'm reading it right so line
584 if you further yield
it says if performed in accordance so
they if they don't perform it in
accordance then they will be liable for
giving out people's information when
they should not have been
I think that we are required to follow
federal law in relation to privacy as
defined by HIPAA there's a lot of case
law on that and there's an emerging code
of federal relations and we are required
to follow it and if we don't we're in
violation of the federal law
thank you
um line 680 if you further yield if
that's okay Mr Speaker
one more and so since we are doing these
pilot programs I'm assuming that's why
pilot study programs that's why we're
instituting the institutional review
board is that are we instituting them
because their research subjects and we
need to do that to apply for the federal
funding
I think you're still in the alternative
disciplinary section am I correct and
that's the specific section for nurses
and I think there are there is some
federal research that goes on about how
you help people keep their license and
keep working for Georgia Citizens it's
section 16. 16 yes about the alternative
disciplinary process for nurses
thank you
chair lady Cooper is recognized for a
question all the way in the bacteria on
the right thank you Mr Speaker will the
presenters yield for a question yes okay
thank you is it not true that unlike the
proposed plan for loan forgivement in
Washington that is a blanket plan and
doesn't look into what the student was
majoring in or where they live
our plan is very specific to areas that
have no one to treat
our mentally ill and that it is very
specific to people that are majoring in
fields such as psychology or social
workers that would be of great value to
helping us meet that major lacking need
of professionals
that we need to treat the mentally ill
and much of our rural areas all over the
state of Georgia
chairman Cooper I think you're spot on I
think one of the things that we need to
remember is this uh for those of us who
I'll say are fortunate enough to live
possibly in Forsyth County or Cherokee
County or other places like that where
I'll say professionals are abundant this
is something that is not nearly acute as
it is in Lanier County and Eccles County
and Ware County so the fact of the
matter is this program is nowhere near
as broad as something that we would see
coming out of DC but rather a strategic
hit in terms of making sure the roles
that we need in order to apply to the
places that we needed to most to hit the
underserved so that we are putting those
proper investments in this body has
absolutely done that with Mercer it's
done with Augusta in terms of the MDS we
have seen the way that we have been able
to hopefully shift our resource and
shift our priority so that we are able
to put more I'll say resources more
capabilities into the areas that need it
most your Birthright within this state
where you live and where you were born
should not define whether or not you get
proper health care and Health Care is
physical and mental and substance abuse
so we need to be able to attack those
and attack those strategically
representative Roman is recognized for a
question on the center Island left
[Music]
thank you Mr Speaker
um does the general lady and gentleman
yield for a question thank you
um is it not true that our EMS Personnel
are called to help someone with mental
health concerns much too often putting a
massive strain on an already over
strained system and that this bill could
help with that
the law enforcement folks I talked to I
asked them what percentage of your of
your 911 calls coming from a family
crisis or mental health issue and they
tell me between 20 and 40 percent
and they have found enormous Savings in
sending mental health professionals out
it's also safer
it's safer for law enforcement it's
safer for the patient it's safer for the
EMS to have someone with that expertise
on a family and psychiatric crisis
if I could just add to that one of the
things that representative Oliver and I
have learned over the course of this
time is that we've also seen the
decriminalization of effectively mental
health and substance abuse so by having
those type of professionals go out they
are being effectively taken to a medical
facility as opposed to a jail first and
we saw for instance in a pilot in
Forsyth County Georgia we saw a rest go
down by 96 percent for this population I
think it's important that we understand
that that's important
we have another question we're going
from a new member who had a great
question to the dean of this house
chairman Gerald Green for a question the
gentleman's recognized thank you thank
you Mr Speaker to the representatives in
the well I guess that's the way to
approach that
I think
uh is it not true that
chairman Cooper has hit
the nail with a hard Hammer about
Southwest Georgia
that the sheriffs of those areas
were calling representative Joe Campbell
and myself one night about 11 30 12
o'clock and saying I don't want to put
this person in jail but we have no other
place to put him
and that goes to the heart of this
and I want to thank you all for the work
that you have put forth because we have
a lot more is that not true
thank you Dean
German makes is recognized for a
question to your extreme right over here
thank you Mr Speaker to the presenter's
yield yes I just wanted to follow up uh
representative Jones or chairman Jones
and I've had a conversation about
section one of the original version of
the bill that is no longer in this
version of the bill but would ask you to
address that on incompetency for uh
quickly please thank you
chairman Meeks thank you so much there
has been a significant amount of
confusion amongst our Collective
constituents about I'll say today's
version of the bill versus the original
version of the bill the original version
of The Bill had a section one that dealt
with a code section that is in law today
the challenge is it's 13 Pages or was 13
pages long and we needed to change about
10 words but according to legislative
Council we had to literally take out and
then put back in simultaneously so it
seemed as if we were changing uh the
definition of mental incompetency it
seems as if we were changing the
standards in terms of how long they
could be held we were changed this we
were changing the standards in terms of
juveniles adults Etc in fact that is not
the case at all the law as it stood on
January 9th when we were sworn in to
this August body was there and that law
will be there when we quote gavel out
cyanide
representative Hutchinson is recognized
for a question thank you Mr Speaker to
the presenters yield
yes is it not true that for mental
health professionals like me when I go
to hire for rural parts of Georgia such
as Banks Stevens white counties that
this loan forgiveness program will be
tremendously helpful to attract talent
to those areas
yes thank you very much and thank you
for this work it's it's wonderful
representative gamble is recognized for
a question
thank you Mr speakers to the presenters
in the well do you yield yes
isn't it true that house bill 520 has
the support of the mental health policy
partnership representing over 20
Statewide Community organizations
including the Georgia Council for
recovery and the best wishes for a due
pass come from the over 800 000
Georgians who are in recovery today
that is true
representative Brad Thomas is recognized
for our question
[Music]
thank you Mr Speaker D.L yield yes uh
one of the questions that I'm getting
pretty consistently from back home is
does this create any type of additional
tax burden for the taxpayer
the short answer of that is no no there
is no new tax burden on a taxpayer in
any of the 20 sections
and if we could save just 20 percent of
the money we spend on multiple
incarcerations multiple ER visits and
multiple law enforcement interactions we
would be ahead of the game
thank you I appreciate the response
we have one more question and I want to
recognize represent representative Wade
for a question to your right inner
career
did the general lady and gentleman yield
yes
thank you both for bringing this bill um
I know both of you and I have talked and
I want to find out is it not true that
Dawson County my home community
we are blessed with many things but one
of the greatest struggles that we have
and where we rank first in this state
breaks my heart is that not true
absolutely and you have shared that with
me and I shared that breaking heart
for the members in the house that is the
fact that my community has the highest
rate of teenage suicide as a as it
relates to our population
and this bill will allow is it not true
that this bill will help us address
that Scourge on my community and every
community in the state that faces that
atrocity
that is an ultimate goal yes thank you
sir appreciate it do the representatives
yield for one more question
is it not true this comes from from me
is it not true that a chair deems this
issue so important
that we've diverged from house rules a
little bit and allowed both of you to
answer these questions that are very
complex y'all answered every one of them
fully and in depth
this issue is so important to our state
that the members of this house this body
need to be fully informed y'all's work
over the years is most greatly
appreciated by me and many other
Georgians
now we're going to vote this issue where
you have no further questions we
appreciate your work
thank you Mr Speaker and we yield the
well
[Applause]
the representatives have yielded the
well

Ralston is smiling down on this body
right now
[Applause]
thank you for your courage
Mr clerk will you read the caption tool
to house bill 470-470.
House Bill 470 by representative Cooper
the 45th and others to be entitled an
act to amend chapter 12 of title 24. the
official go to Georgia annotated
relating medical and other confidential
information so it's allow for voluntary
open Communications related Health Care
Under The Rules of Evidence this bill
ever referred to the committee on
Judiciary that committee recommends that
this bill
do pass
chair recognizes chair lady Sharon
Cooper to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house this afternoon
you're going to be voting on several
other tort reform bills that are coming
forward
and House Bill 470 known as the Georgia
Candor act brings a little bit of a
different approach to tort reform
but a part of that of those that are
going to be presented today
we have a current system of Shame and
blame
when there's been an adverse Health Care
outcome and that has led to deny
defend delay and litigation
Candor is a significant step in changing
that culture
to what of working together in a
straightforward honest and transparent
manner to help the patient find a timely
and positive resolution for themselves
and since I'm talking about the fact of
people working together
I want to thank the Georgia trial
lawyers
Mr Snipes and Jordan I want to thank a
group of citizens related and you know
part of the medical community that came
together
and also the hospital Association that
over the past two and a half years we
have worked on this issue so it's truly
working together for the betterment of
George's
let me tell you it's a briefing what
happens in Candor if there is an adverse
Health Care outcome
on a prompt matter you know the hospital
would notify or the or the doctor the
patient and ask them if they wanted to
participate in Candor
if they did they would be strongly
encouraged to get an attorney to
represent them
the hospital or the doctors they would
have their attorney
they would meet together
and in a manner of transparency the
patient would get their records if it
was a doctor and had made a mistake they
would admit their mistake you know and
then and express their remorse for it
happening and believe it or not most
doctors if they ever make a mistake or
come close really are truly remorseful
and it hangs over their head
and they would try to come to a
resolution
in a more timely manner litigation is
extremely expensive and it can take
three four five years to come to a
conclusion for a patient what does the
patient do during that time
and the litigation bills are extremely
and that causes many people who are
harmed
to be unable to resolve their problems
because what happened to them
would never rise to the to where they
would have enough money in recovery
to make it worthwhile what it cost to
bring their complaint to litigation
so when they do candor
it is not in the court system
they meet together they discuss what has
happened and they try to come to a
resolution where a settlement can be
offered there and they do it in a timely
manner there's a hundred and five a
hundred and
I've lost it 150 days
150 days from the time the incident
happened
or they should have known it happened to
have been heard for them to enter into
candor
if they do that then they try to come to
resolution in 60 days
can you imagine coming to a positive
solution and having a settlement in that
short period of time
takes longer if it takes longer to get
the hospital records if the patient in
the hospital or the patient the doctor
agreed that time can be extended
if it's a voluntary
a procedure if the patient doesn't want
to do it they don't have to if the
hospital doesn't want to do it they
don't have to if the doctor doesn't want
to it is strictly voluntary but if they
do enter into candor
let's say they decide that they're not
getting resolution they can leave at any
time and proceed with litigation
the doctor or the hospital can drop out
and what Candor does if they do that
everything that has been said in Candor
cannot be used in the court process
this is what Candor does it will not
work in every situation but I can tell
you one of the states that's had Candor
working now for about a year and a half
has done well over a hundred cases where
Candor was used
and all but three of them
were they were resolved and and you know
and came to a resolution and the patient
and issue was resolved and only three
went on to litigation
this is not a Panacea it's one tool in
the toolbox to change our culture and
with that Mr Speaker I will answer a few
questions
and I hope everybody will remember I'm
not a lawyer and I might have to have
help from
one of our lawyers in case you get real
technical
the lady yield for a question if I need
a lawyer help me
representing Becky Evans to your left
has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentlelady
yield
the lady will yell yes
um yeah I just want to ask what state
was that and is this a term if we look
up like if we wanted to if we wanted to
search on Candor yes you can you can you
would see other states where where and
yes where this has been done and then
what was the other state you were
referring to just I was referring to
Colorado okay and I will tell you it's
uh it's in three states now that have
passed it since other states are
considering it
Colorado and Iowa pass Candor with no
dissenting votes one of those States is
Republican the other one is Democrat and
they pass Candor with no dissenting
votes
at the for that election it's coming
together to help patients it also helps
our doctors when we talk about trying to
keep our doctors nothing weighs more
heavily on a doctor than to have the
threat of a lawsuit hanging over their
head and it helps to lead to burnout
it's not the total call cause but they
will tell you that it does add to their
wish to quit and not practice as long
and certainly you know patients that go
you know with something unresolved I
will tell you now I still have feelings
about Tom's death I think there was a
problem I wasn't after money but if we
go through this and we look back I have
unresolved issues about what happened in
his last hospital admission and I'm a
nurse so I know a lot about it
and I would have appreciated being able
to enter into a Candor discussion about
what happened and I think if you ask
your friends and family there many of
them will tell you that they have things
happen to them that have been unresolved
and that still concern them
lady yield for another question yes sir
chairman Martin Newton to your right has
a question
The gentlelady Guild I will
is it not true that I have great respect
and appreciation for your work on this
and and the medical field in general
really loves the idea of a an
alternative to the adversarial role that
goes on for years and that that your
work on this is going to make a great
option against that adversarial policy
to try to allow both patients and
doctors
to learn and to move on and make things
safer for all thank you and and that's
that's one Posse things
about resolving for the patient but
that's first and then the doctor it's
about changing the system so that the
mistake is not made again what if it's a
patient was in surgery and they needed a
thousand CC of a certain fluid and the
nurse goes to where that's stored and
picks up a thousand CC bottle takes it
back in and hooks it up to the patient
and it's the wrong fluid and this is a
little far-fetched from that because you
know one with sugar and one was saline
probably not going to cause a problem
but let's say the patient had a real
adversary reaction and they were harmed
and it kept them from working for you
know and they were the hospital three
months or something like that so they've
been affected about it and they've lost
thing
finding a resolution for that patient
but also when that comes to light and
people are honest about what happened
then they can go look at the system and
say you know that could happen again we
need to separate those bottles and one
needs to be on one side of the you know
the room and the others need to be on
the other side so it's much less likely
that a nurse will ever pick up the wrong
bottle again and have the same adverse
reaction
thank you for this legislation I look
forward to supporting it thank you ma'am
thank you very much for your comments
lady yield for a couple more yes sir
represented sharper to your left and the
back thank you Mr Speaker with a
generator yield yes I will is it true
that I was on a committee where we heard
from experts all across the country and
got great information and I fully
support this bill because I believe in
what it's saying and what it can
actually do for our citizens thank you
representative Trapper I appreciate that
we
experts we we bring we brought in people
working with Cantor and trying to teach
hospitals about it because it is a
change and it will be an education
process but we also brought and had
people testify who had lost one lady
lost a child uh another another family
member so thank you representative
sharper
lady has one more question if you'll
yield yes sir I will representative
Reese from District 140 I think over in
Columbus area is a question thank you Mr
Speaker does the lady Yale I will for a
very good uh new member of my committee
I will representative thank you madam
chair isn't it true that this bill is in
a fly-by-night bill that it was some
hard work and collaboration between the
legal entity and the medical entity to
pull together to a compromise that
worked for all people and is going to
make this a solid Bill not only for the
legal field but for the medical field
and as a practicing attorney I support
this Bill thank you sir that is true it
was a collaboration between all three
groups the lady has no further questions
thank you Mr Speaker I would ask the the
members for their positive vote on this
and I will yield The Well the lady has
yielded the well we have no speakers is
there any objection to the previous
question being order that you're here
has done the previous question is
ordered is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill that chair hears none the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
have all members voted
have all members voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
163 the Nays are one
the bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed Mr clerk will you read the
caption to house bill 530 5 3 0. house
bill 530 by representative 176 to be
entitled an act to amend Article 5 or
chapter 11 a Title IX of the official go
to George annotated relating to
depositions in Discovery so as to
provide for protective orders for
certain high-ranking officers
this bill ever refer to the committee on
Judiciary that committee recommends that
this bill do pass
the gentleman from the
176th house district burchett is
recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
and uh just got some good news my son
he's a wrestler and they just got new
leotards and he sent me a picture so I
was just checking that out
so
well uh thank you colleagues I know it's
been a long day and this is not not too
terribly uh contentious of a bill here
uh this is House Bill 5 uh 30 I'm
reading from LC 44 2300 what this bill
is commonly referred to as the Apex
Doctrine and
um what we've got here is a a very
gentleman will suspend
these issues are important to Georgians
imported to us all the gentleman will
continue
thank you Ms speaker so
what we've got here is a very narrowly
tailored compromise so that is a reform
for folks in civil litigation and what
this does is for it defines what an
officer is and an officer of a
high-ranking organization
like a large corporation or a large
Department need not be called in for a
deposition unless they have unique
knowledge
the the impetus for the bill is there's
a court case out there that involved a
large automaker and and that automaker
the CEO of that automaker was requested
to be deposed and naturally the CEO of a
large corporation here in the United
States or pretty much probably anywhere
in the world has significant scheduling
extensive scheduling
demand fans and unique scheduling
demands and for that reason unless they
have unique knowledge the argument was
made why do we got to bring the CEO in
why do we have to bring the CEO in this
the argument they made was that you're
bringing this Co in just a badger
essentially Badger the company
and what this would do would say that a
protective order would be issued in the
event that there is no unique knowledge
for a large for an officer of a large
corporation or a large department and it
codifies
statutory legislation at the federal
level our Discovery rules in the state
of Georgia are very Broad and this
narrows it up a little bit gives some
protection to the business
Community this is sought after by the
both the chamber and many many of your
businesses will be happy about this and
and also it's a so it's narrowly
tailored enough that the litigants will
also be in support of this and that's
pretty much the Crux of the bill and
um Mr Speaker I'll stand for questions
if anybody has any questions
foreign
yields
representative Jasmine Clark to your
left has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield legitimate yields um so on line 45
it says that um this will be an officer
of an organization that is large and
complex yes ma'am what
what is the difference between large and
complex and medium and maybe simple or
small and simple I guess I'm just trying
to figure out who would this apply to
and who would it not apply to oh that's
very astute of you to find those words
there these words so this is part of the
compromise to assure that
um
we don't cast too broad of a net here
that we that you can't bring in that
this applies to every company so much
like everything in the code you would
have to argue what large and complex is
I mean I think I could give I could come
up with a
um an example for you I would say that
GM a Fortune 500 company with I think
you know
tens of thousand employees would be both
large and it would be complex because it
does business across the United States
across the world
and I would submit to you that is as
large and complex
and so to the to the Other Extreme I
would submit to you that the CEO of a
hot dog stand
that delivers Hot Dogs or or serves hot
dogs would neither be large nor complex
and this is going to be a discretionary
decision by the judge that two lawyers
are going to have to stand up and argue
is it always going to be exactly the
same I don't expect it will be but I
think that we've got to use a little bit
of Common Sense here and understand that
there is a difference between you know
the hot dog stand and GM
gentlemen you yield for another question
the gentleman yields
chairman Bill Hitchens to your left has
a question
now you're ready
well the gentleman yield gentleman
yields I'm about forgot what I was going
to talk about now but uh
no really wait a minute that might take
a long time if you forgot what you're
going to talk about
does this um would would this affect the
public and the private sector yes sir it
would affect the public and private
sector so for instance uh I know the
gentleman
has a history of serving the great state
of Georgia in many capacities and in his
former capacity
um
this would protect you if you did not
have
um unique knowledge
would you further yield of course and
and I just want to give a
nickname of something that happened one
time that I it probably happened
15 20 years ago but I had to give a
deficit I gave many depositions over my
career but I had to give a deposition
one time about something that occurred
about three years before I I went into
that position I wasn't even in the
agency and I always thought I was
improper would discover that
um if you didn't have unique knowledge
and the court decided that you were a
officer of a large organization large
and complex organization then yes it
would apply to you
thank you thank you representative Roman
has a question right up the front
hey does the gentleman yield gentlemen
yields
um is it not true that this could
prevent the deposition of Bad actors in
high positions potentially eroding the
concept of rule of law because the idea
is that if this is meant to stop
deposing people that might not have
knowledge of something
people do have the concept of plausible
deniability so couldn't that potentially
just serve as another tool in that
toolbox representative I heard like
nothing you said I couldn't hear
anything you said I'm sorry can you hear
me I didn't hear you yes ma'am okay is
it not true that this could prevent the
deposition of Bad actors in high
positions potentially eroding the
concept of rule of law
um I I don't know if I agree with your
characterization I think that under the
current law
um is is Justice always given is is the
right decision always made I don't think
I don't think that's we can no one here
can say yes or no to that question I get
your point
um this this hinges on
terms of art if you have knowledge if if
I can convince the judge that you have
knowledge and you're an officer you have
specific knowledge that nobody else has
unique knowledge to you then I should be
able to get your deposition now if
you're if you're being represented by an
attorney an attorney is astute enough to
convince the court that
the knowledge that you have is not
unique to you and someone else could
have it and you qualify as an officer
then the information could be sought
after from someone else but to your
question I don't think anybody can
answer that question
um you know honestly
thank you Mr Speaker the gentleman has a
couple of questions that I'm interested
in
and it comes from the two members that
sit on sit on both sides of you so I'm
wondering I want to find out what y'all
haven't spoken about so I'm going to
recognize the majority leader of this
house lead our illustration for a
question
famous Spears Gentleman Jim and yields
this whip isn't it true that we often
talk about George the best state in the
country to do business and through
really countless hours you have put into
this Apex legislation this bill helps to
further that cause and that message that
we can send nationally and
internationally for our state isn't that
true Mr leader I I believe that to be
wholeheartedly true and appreciate the
leader pointing it out to everybody
thank you for your hard work we're the
number one business to do number one
state to do business I almost none in
one business uh
that's not fair
sorry Miss figure we we are the number
one state to do business and you know
for those of my friends
um in this chamber that are seeking out
uh a day to uh
um you know have equal justice under the
civil litigation system in the state of
Georgia this is your day you should vote
proudly with a green here and I would
encourage you to do so
okay you have a couple more if you want
them Mr Speaker
um the hour is late and I am ready as
many of my folks are here I'm going to
yield the well if you don't the
gentleman has yielded the well if you
had a question I didn't get to you
come see the whip right down front is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
that Jerry hears none the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the pastor of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machine
have all members voted
have all members voted if so
the clerk will lock the machine on the
passage of the bill the yeas were
156 the Nays eight the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
Mr clerk if you read the caption to
House Bill 529
houseville 529 by representative
Williams 148th being titled back to
amend title 33 in title 40 in the
official code of Georgia annotated
laying the insurance and motor vehicles
and traffic
shows to provide for minimum amounts of
uninsured and underinsured modus
coverage be maintained by transfer
Transportation Network companies and
taxi service companies this bill ever
for the committee on insurance that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
chairman Noel Williams
is recognized to present the bill 529
thank you Mr Speaker this is a bill that
we worked on last year and it's an
in-coll model and we worked a lot across
the aisle on this and we work with some
of our lawyer friends and so it's a tort
reform type of Bill basically this bill
aims to bring the state of Georgia
Transportation Network companies or
tnc's Uber and Lyft
the code in line with the national TNC
Insurance model
currently Georgia's Insurance code
requires tncs to provide one million
dollars in uninsured motorists and
underinsured motorist coverage for TNC
drivers engaged in the service
we represent the spill in the house last
last session with the National Council
of insurance legislators recommended a
few changes with the new language
included in this legislation
tncs are required to carry uninsured and
underinsured coverage of one hundred
thousand dollars per person for bodily
injury 300
000 per accident for bodily injury and
twenty five thousand dollars for
property damage
like I said this was worked on both
sides of the aisle we had attorneys and
insurance companies agreeing on
something they were all singing Kumbaya
so this is a great bill we can get it
passed and get it over across the hall
with that Mr Speaker I'll yield for any
questions
you have a question if you will yield
uh yes sir representative Jasmine Clark
to your left has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes ma'am all right so in this uh
process who is the the Uber and Lyft
driver
then the lady will suspend just for a
moment
back with the vibration of the
vibration go ahead
now I can hear you
um there's a gentleman yield once more
okay yeah yes
um so in this situation I just want to
be clear on Whose uninsured or
underinsured it's not the Uber or Lyft
driver correct that is correct it is a
per the person in the car with them the
purse the person in the car is uninsured
or under they're uninsured or
underinsured the motorists because no no
you're right I'm sorry the Lyft driver
yes because Lyft is required to carry
that coverage on them and this is making
their rates seem to be higher and we're
hoping you know once we get this bill
implemented this will help with our
rates as well so
Uber and Lyft can hire drivers without
proving that they are insured
well it's underinsured and insured
motorist and this is just helping and
we're one of 42 States
um of the 42 States we're one of the
worst ones for this because we're
covering that a million dollars and what
we're seeing is we're going to cover
them down to 300 000 instead of a
million if something were to happen in
an accident like that there's still a
million dollar for the regular but for
the uninsured or underinsured it's a
hundred thousand three hundred thousand
or twenty five thousand this was fully
vetted in the insurance Committee in
both subcommittees and then we had
testimonies and everyone was was in
accordance in agreement and we've worked
on this for a couple of years so it's a
great deal I appreciate your support
thank you
with that Mr Speaker I know the hour is
getting late
would you take one question from a
gentleman that sure knows a lot about
this issue
Majority Leader illustration is
recognized for a question
famous speakers Jim O'Neill sure Mr
chairman isn't it true that the these
limits are for the purpose of ensuring
that there is coverage for the passenger
who may be injured as well as other
drivers other motorists who may be on
the road when these rideshares uh are
are operating and that this uh is an
issue that you've worked on for some
time to ensure that those limits are
proper and appropriate in consideration
of the risks and also the expense to all
involved is that fair sir yes sir that's
a great summation all right and you've
worked on this issue for over a year
isn't that true yes we have and I had a
lot of help from another member that I
won't call his name but he was very
instrumental with the National Council
of insurance legislators and it was some
of his model legislation that we arrived
at this thank you thank you very much
for your explanation thank you for your
question members I appreciate your

representative Leverett is recognized to

thank you Mr Speaker ladies and

clarifies a point of law with regard to
conservatorships for adults who are not

existing law already provides that the
conserver can settle a claim of that of
their ward of the person that they're
acting on behalf of if it's twenty five
thousand dollars or less and if it is
over 25 000 they have to get Court
approval this just clarifies that the 25
000 well and it's the gross settlement
has to be that number and this bill
simply defines the term gross settlement
as it's used in that Statute in a way
that I think is customarily applied and
it's been interpreted that way this just

agency Bill to reorganize modernize and
clarify current regulation
additional Provisions were added
approximately line 237 to 264. these
Provisions allow certain Niche Beauty
services
to uh to be performed without licensing
if a health and safety course is
completed
so the niche Beauty for uh services
addressed are essentially what you do
when you get up in the morning get ready
to go
so this is blow dry styling
this is the practice of washing drying
and arranging hair this isn't cutting
this isn't dying this isn't using
chemical processes to alter the
structure of the hair
threading
is a traditional form of hair removal
from South Asia in the Middle East it is
a practice of using only a piece of
cotton thread to form loops around and
remove unwanted facial hair makeup
application
this is the practice of applying
Cosmetics to a person's face
so this bill actually corrects
inconsistencies in the regulation about
this currently our cosmetology laws
uh basically regulate makeup application
based on what you do after the makeup's
applied so what I'll as an example for
instance if you're uh if you're doing
film television or entertainment a
license is not required if you're doing
cosmetic counter sales a license is not
required it even makes uh exceptions for
special events so our this law modifies
that just to exclude that from licensure
since most practices are already
excluded anyway
so these things we're talking about this
is not the first time we've addressed
this back in 2006 this body Exempted uh
hair braiding in much the same manner
we're doing here so this is this is uh
inconsistent with what we've done in the
past uh what we're doing with these
these certain safe practices
so in order to do this we addressed
health and safety concerns by requiring
a four-hour annual health and safety
class
these classes are approved by the
Georgia Board of Cosmetology it's what
licensed cosmetologists already take
so this is an entrepreneur's bill this
bill creates opportunity
the most likely people to benefit from
this bill are women
single moms those who do not have higher
education those that can't afford higher
education uh people of color immigrant
communities
under Georgia's current cosmetology laws
to do these safe Niche practices you
have to complete one of three licenses
these licenses take between a thousand
fifteen hundred hours of training costs
about seventeen thousand five hundred
dollars so again with low income
uh Georgians it becomes not only a
question of the cost of this training
but also
often the larger question is is being
able to to devote the time to it when
you're trying to to make ends meet
so these exceptions are common uh 32
states
exempt these practices in some form or
another
um there are examples that show
deregulation of these practices create
opportunity
in Mississippi once they deregulated
Hair Braiding they have 1200 registered
braiders Louisiana you have to have a a
cosmetology license to do hair braiding
there's only 32 registered braiders in
the state of Louisiana so and this and
there is a larger African-American
population in the state of Louisiana so
that either says that I mean what that
most likely says to me that these
practices are occurring unlicensed and
again without any health and safety
training
so five states have had to change their
laws as a result of lawsuits and I just
implore this body not to require the
citizens of Georgia to to seek seek
relief from the Judiciary in this matter
this is something we can take care of
here and create Opportunity by creating
good public policy
so I was raised by I'm the youngest of
five children I was raised by a single
mother and I I know all the sacrifices
she had to make and and as well you know
all the juggling she had to do from day
to day to make ends meet you know quite
frequently the the dinner we ate was the
money she made to to buy that for us may
have been earned in the last 24 hours so
removing
these barriers uh they're they're
they're they're liberating for for our
lower income Georgians you know as a
similar story I have I recently retired
from the Army about seven years ago
and uh I you know I have a I'm a
helicopter pilot but but when I retired
I retired into a very bad job market and
uh
you know the
comp what's common with military people
transitioning to the civilian world is
you have a skill mismatch ultimately if
there's an abundance of applicants the
applicants from the civilian Community
will always have the experience that
that more closely aligns with the job
market so it took me a while to
transition like a lot of veterans that
was about a year before I was able to
get back into into my profession so
during this time you know although I was
retired you know that's about a third of
my salary uh disability came much later
I was in a period of having to make ends
meet I didn't need a new profession I
just needed to make some money for a
while and uh so I you know I had a
bulldozer I did mechanic work I built
fences whatever I could do and
thankfully I had opportunity because I
wasn't regulated out of the ability to
to to earn a living and that's that's
what we need to think about
um
in closing this bill creates opportunity
birth death marriage divorce recessions
disability life happens these events
particularly affect low-income Georgians
where we can we must reduce the burden
of Occupational licensing so people have
the flexibility to support their
families uh you know and and here we can
pontificate how this license will help
Georgians and I'll tell you the answer
to that question is about as infinite as
the 11 million Georgians out there uh in
in my military career I've had the
opportunity to live in country where
bodies just like this make the financial
decisions and they decide where the
restaurants and the hotels and
everything goes and you know that's
that's not what we do here here our job
is to create create opportunity and I
encourage you to do this
um in this case the liberty and the
opportunity we create here today
uh is not for the Georgians that have
lobbyists out in the hallway I know we
do wonderful things for uh for industry
every day but the people we help here
there's no lobbyists in the hallways
Forum uh they're not as organized as
perhaps some people opposing this their
voices may not ring as loud in this
chamber but their voices are important
and I encourage you to listen
um and and let's let's create
opportunity here and I encourage you to
pass house bill 212.
gentlemen yield for questions I do yield
for questions just for informational
purposes
we have about 10 people signed up to
speak to the bill all right and we have
about
um
I can't count that high with my shoes on
just to have to have questions on the
bill
we all recognize representing more for
the first question to your left
good evening
isn't it true
that you know absolutely nothing about
a woman of Colors Hair and is it also
not true that I am highly offended that
you would want to take away a license to
potentially would give me a disease or
pull the rest of my hair out
okay I'm not want someone licensed okay
so I'm not proposing taking a license
away what was the other thing that that
you mentioned well that's what this bill
is all about uh it's actually not this
uh this building the state of Georgia
Western announcement if the lady will
yield we'll have a question and the
gentleman in the well needs to answer
that question
two
that this bill would require
women who spit on thread women who know
nothing about taking care of edges and
chemical reactions to threading and
braiding
to take away a license just so that the
state of Georgia can make money
so Georgia currently doesn't license
braiders so this bill has nothing to do
with that so it won't take away a
license for braiding
you're required you're not requiring a
license for it there's not a license
required for braiding hair in Georgia
today prior to the passage of this bill
from reading this the lady has a
question stated question isn't it true
that you're requiring no license for
this or for braiders or for uh stringers
and the peep threaders who do your
eyebrows and they thread they thread
hair they thread your eyebrows they
thread your your mouth your chin so this
Bill does exempt threaders from
licensing
Raiders are currently exempt from
Licensing in Georgia uh currently and so
this bill doesn't change that you're not
trying to ask for a license for this
no I'm not changing to ask for a license
for braiders
and isn't it also true that you're
asking for
for this bill to pass so that the state
of Georgia can make more money off of
doing something that's a little illegal
in IU
I'm I'm not I don't understand how the
state of Georgia would make more money
but I do hope it creates opportunity
for Georgians to support their families
and make more money
yield for a question represent gentlemen
yield I yield representative Barnes has
a question
to your left
thank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman
yield I yield
is it not true that if an unlicensed
person washes my hair and it falls out
that I
cannot file an illegal uh
any legal ramifications for them making
my hair fall out
so if someone could wash your hair and
make it fall out your legal recourse
would be no different than than with a
licensed or unlicensed person
if that was possible
does the gentleman yield I yield thank
you
is it not true that
I take pride in my hair and I and I
take really good care of my hair and if
an unlicensed person does not take
courses or classes to take care of my
hair and my hair falls out that I can
take legal actions
well
again I'm sure you do take good care of
your hair and if if having a licensed
person wash your hair would make you
feel comfortable that's still going to
be a choice that you can that you can
make so we're not gonna we're not uh
removing licensure from washing hair you
can still choose a licensed person to
wash your hair and if and if somebody if
you choose to have someone without a
license wash it it really doesn't change
your legal recourse if if that you know
if if if that something happens does the
gentleman yield for one more question I
do thank you
um
ready will suspend
the member asking and the member
answering the question can't hear each
other so thank you Mr Speaker we hope
you members will
certain respect this process lady will
continue thank you is it not true that
if this bill passes it not only helps uh
low-income single families minorities
but it helps everyone who wants to move
into this business unlicensed
so the the the parts the things that we
are we are exempting from license would
would allow them yes to do that uh
without a license yes I don't know quite
what you're asking there
gentlemen Geo for another question
I'll yell for one more representing
Maynor to your right has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I yield is it not true that this
is definitely a complicated bill it has
some good points and some bad points
um do you further yield
uh I would say I disagree that it has
bad points but uh go ahead so the bill
does not have a minimum age and so my
daughter Alexis who's 10
she thinks it will be really cute to
open up a parlor and wash girls hair
because now she can but
isn't it also true that that requires a
lot of liability insurance so whether it
were my ten-year-old daughter or a 40
year old person if you're going to wash
hair
and it falls out as someone said and
hopefully it won
isn't it further true that
liability insurance is important for
those things liability insurance is is
important
further true that this is a business
opportunity because
one of the things that you mentioned
earlier braiders are not licensed
and they're also not required to take
that four hour course that is now
required that is a current part of
Georgia law that this bill did not
address so so this this bill doesn't
address braiders
I mean it's already legal for break for
braiders to be exempt from licensing so
that that is this bill does not change
that is it further true that if they
wash the hair though they have to take
the four-hour course
this bill requires a health and safety
training in order to practice these
Services thank you
so with that I Mr Speaker I yield the
well
the gentleman has yielded the well
now we have some speakers lined up here
to speak to bring some clarity
to this issue
we're first going to recognize chairman
Parsons to speak to the bill I'm sure he
can offer some insight here
chairman Parsons
oh thank you speaker I appreciate the
opportunity to come up here gentlemen
yield
that any room's empty
I can't see any if the gentleman will
received from the well
the gentleman will step down from the
well
Mr chairman if you'll step down for a
second oh I'm sorry
y'all know I want to go home you all
want to go home so let's be respectful
unless we've had a good good day
so let's be respectful and hear the
member in the well and hear the
questions from
everyone present here so we can move on
with this important issue
I would certainly appreciate it and
we're going to do just that back door is
open that door is open
and that one's open my mama told me not
to point so I'm sorry but that's what
we're going to do let's move on Mr
chairman you'll recognized to go back to
the well all right thank you speaker
Burns I signed up to speak on this bill
I'll be very brief when you sign up you
have to sign up to I mean I guess they
always ask you speaking in
in favor of the bill or opposed to it
and I know I can tell you I'm going to
vote against it I'm not going to try to
to influence anybody one way or the
other the way that they vote but I would
just say that uh you know I hadn't
looked at this bill I heard about the
last couple of days and I'm pulling out
of the book a while ago
and I know it went through committee I'm
a I greatly respect the committee
process so I know there's been vetted in
the in a committee process uh so I'm not
going to try at all to pick things apart
in the bill because I know it's already
been vetted but I would point out that
it it does
um actually repeal a whole chapter of
title 43 repeals it entirely so if you
look at the bill
all you see is new language now I don't
know what the old language was you know
if I had time and if I really wanted to
come up here and talk specifically about
points of this bill I would have I would
have to go pull the the code up and see
what that current chapter says but it's
not in here I notice that they're
writing more bills like this I believe
but the whole bill if you look at this
it's like 19 Pages 18 or 19 pages of new
code that's what it shows all underline
new code
so I would just say uh
I'm going to vote against it I would
just uh caution anyone before you cast a
vote to really consider this and been
mentioned about the lobbyists down in
the hall
uh
I've never talked to any lobbyist about
this and I've carried some cosmetology
bills years ago never have talked to the
lobbyists about it but who I do talk to
about these a lot of times are the
ladies who have cut my hair and the
gentleman who've cut my hair over the
years and they have opinions on this
kind of thing and they they've gone
through the training to either cut hair
or to style hair or whatever and they've
gone through either going through school
or they've gone through a training
program there at you know one of the
styling or barber shops themselves are
going through the proper training to do
those things
and I think it's very important to them
they're professionals
the people that cut your hair style your
hair whatever it is they are
professionals and they work very very
hard
you know it's until at some point and
they didn't all come from some kind of a
privileged background I can tell you
that
and they've gone into it and put in the
time put in the training put in the
study
the experience to get their licenses
and I think we need to take into
consideration that but I guess the main
thing I would say
if you vote Yes on it
you know you might have some questions
about it you know this weekend or next
week when you when you get your hair cut
go get it styled or whatever because
they don't have lobbyists out here
these are the young ladies and the men
who cut hair and style it they don't
have lobbyists out here those are the
people are going to talk to you about it
if we do something that they that they
find that we've
done some irrational
action down here but they didn't ask us
to do
I don't even know who did ask for this
to be done
but I would just ask that you uh you
think about that
and you might look up
the current language
you're replacing a whole paragraph like
18 pages
so before you vote you might want to
think about what it is what is it that
you're replacing
and that's all I've got to say about it
I yield well
the gentleman has yielded well thank you
chairman
representative Jasmine Clark
is recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise to ask
you to vote no on this bill and while I
do not necessarily think that the entire
bill
um is is bad I do have several concerns
so there are a lot of new faces in here
so I will um I'm only saying this part
for those who don't know already I have
a PhD in microbiology and so I know a
little bit about bacteria fungus and
things like that that you could possibly
come in contact with at a hair salon or
a nail salon or getting your makeup done
and things like that and so one of my
major concerns with this bill is the
fact that we say certain people don't
have to be licensed and one can argue
okay they're not dealing with chemicals
they're doing things that someone could
do at home so yes
um they don't they shouldn't need a life
since to do these things however in the
provision that asks for them to take a
health and safety course
they are only required to take up to
four hours of health and safety ever
one else in this profession has to get
continuing education credits and the
reason why is because things change as
the industry change as we learn new
things as different things you know 20
years ago MRSA might not have been as
big of a deal as it is now when it comes
to antibiotic resistant bacteria
and so we want to make sure that
individuals are getting up-to-date
information and so I think that
something that is critically missing
from this bill is a requirement that
those health and safety courses be
renewed ever so often I don't think
that's too much to ask for and I think
we're dealing with people's faces we're
dealing with people's hair
we don't want people being subjected to
fungal or bacterial infections on their
faces that can't be treated with certain
types of antibiotics
we don't want people's hair falling out
and these are things that could be
um these are things that we need to
consider when we're having people so
intimately in contact with our bodies
and so that's one thing that I would say
we need to have renewal requirements for
the health and safety course if in fact
they're going to have to take one and
another thing the gentleman
um in the well the sponsor of the bill
made an attempt to describe threading
and he did kind of a good job so I'm not
going to take that away from him however
I have been to a threading salon
and I'm not sure how many people in here
have been to a threading salon but one
of the things that happens when they
thread they take the thread and they
basically roll it up against the hairs
on your I'll just say your eyebrows and
then they rip that from your skin
and so they're ripping it from the
follicle
a lot of times when they do that as
they're doing it they hold the thread
right here in their mouth
before as they're holding it
that
introduces the potential
for some type of bacterial or fungal
infection
I think it would it's important that
individuals that are doing that practice
actually have shown that they understand
the ramifications of doing this and so
I believe that while a lot of the
braiders and shampoo girls I've been to
plenty of salons that had them that
makes sense that they may not need a
license although I do think the health
and safety course is good I do think
that threaters should require a license
because that's a little bit more
intimate most people I know are not
threading themselves at home that is
something that someone else really has
to do to you and so
this bill
is not where it needs to be for the
health and safety of Georgians and if
we're going to completely repeal a
section of the code and replace it with
something else let's replace it with
something good and so I'm asking you to
vote no on this Bill thank you Mr
Speaker I yieldable
