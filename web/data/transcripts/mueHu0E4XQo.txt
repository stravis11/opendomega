TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning, it is a little a little past eight and we do have a quorum, so I would like to get started after I ask Chairman Meeks to open us up with prayer.
Let's pray.
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day.
We thank you for the opportunity to once again do the people's work of our state.
We pray that you will be amidst the decisions that we make, help us guide us, guide us
and direct us and continue to be with former chairman, Terry England, our friend as he
recovers from the injuries to your Heavenly Father.
We speak with our family.
That's at home.
Keep them safe.
Until we return.
These are all our blessings.
We ask in your name, amen.
day is a special day. Not only is it my oldest daughter's 29th birthday, Emily, it's also
Repson of Debbie Butner's birthday. So happy birthday to everybody. And so y'all know
she is taking selfies. As many selfies as she is old and I did not ask her how many selfies
she was going to take so all right well thank y'all glad you're here this morning
first up we'll have representative Stacy Evans HR 118 and I just do want to
mind everybody we do have to be out of here in an hour hope it doesn't take that
long but we do have a one hour deadline I should be able to contribute to that
Mr. Chairman good morning Mr. Chairman members of the committee I have two
resolutions and if it's okay with the chairman I'd like to start with HR 119
sort of 118 just for fun this morning. So we're on HR 119 first. Yes thank you
Mr. Chairman. HR 119 is a resolution that we've heard before in this
committee and passed out both in this committee and on the House floor but
briefly this resolution would compensate Mario's gents come. He was the first
exoneration by the Fulton Conviction Integrity Unit. He shot in self-defense
He maintained from the beginning of the charge that it was self-defense physical evidence has always supported the testimony that the shooting was in self-defense
There was a key witness to the murder that was believed to be dead and therefore the jury did not hear his crucial testimony
14 years after Mr. Stinch comes in carceration
It was discovered that the key witness was not deceased
As previously believed and then when he was brought in he corroborated that the shooting was indeed in response to
the victim shooting first and that's supporting the self-defense defense which
again was also supported always by physical evidence. So Mr. Stinchcom spent
18 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit. Of course, Miss Time
with Family, Prime Erning Years during employment and all the pleasures of
life that we enjoy. He's done his best to put his life back together since this
and I humbly ask for compensation under this resolution for Mr. Stinchcom and
happy to take any questions Mr. Chairman. Are there any questions? I don't see any
questions. We have a motion to do pass is there a second? We have a second. All those in
favor of passage of LC-60-053-HR, say aye.
Any opposed?
Motion carries.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
Next up is HR-118.
This is a resolution to compensate Michael Wolfhoek for wrongful after his exoneration.
Mr. Wolfhoek was involved in the same incident with Mr. Stinchcom. They were co-defendants and
Mr. Stinchcom went through the Fulton
Conviction Integrity Unit first and then Mr. Wolfhoek went second, but same issue self-defense physical evidence always supported
Self-defense and he was also exonerated by the Fulton conviction integrity unit and asked for your favorable consideration. Happy to answer any questions
I do have a question about the these resolutions we heard last year, correct?
Yes, that's the gentleman. We're here during the testimony, right?
Yes, both gentlemen were actually here during the subcommittee where they passed.
And both of these resolutions passed last year, both in this committee and on the House floor.
Both Mr. Stinchcomb and Mr. Woolfolk drive trucks for a living.
And so they do their best to be here when they can, but sometimes they can.
Are there any questions?
What's the pleasure?
I have a motion, do pass, and a second on the LC60, 0, 0, 5, 4, House Resolution 118.
All those in favor say aye.
Any opposed?
Motion carries.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next up is House Resolution 129.
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee do appreciate this opportunity it is an honor
actually to stand here and try to write this wrong that happened in my community so long
ago.
So 129 involves the case for Mr. Daryl Lee Clark at the time of the crime he was 17 years
old.
The case involves Russian Roulette.
He was not present when this happened.
It involves tragedy, I would say, that happened.
And the process of his trial where there was a sexual relationship
with the lead detective having an ongoing relationship
with the victims and there was manufactured evidence,
which included fault statements.
It involved a defendant who was, excuse me, a witness who was deaf, mute, and severely
learning impaired, who had no use of regular sign language.
Special interpreters were not involved in the case to help understand what happened.
There was witness intimidation and coercion.
The detective threatened and coerced another witness in the giving false and perjured testimony.
There was false testimony when the detective testified falsely at trial as did the coerce
witness.
There were Brady violations.
This was a very, very sad case, I think, as I look back on it.
Mr. Clark lost 25 years of his life.
When the state makes a mistake, I do feel strongly that it is ours to try to go back and compensate.
You cannot correct anyone's lost life, lost years of learning, lost years of working,
lost years of time to have a family and relationships.
The dollar amount will never compensate the years that were lost for Mr. Clark.
I do ask, this was hard last year, I appreciate the sport that was there, they passed out
of the house with this resolution passed out of the house with 162 yeses and two
noses. They were present here for the previous hearing. They were up in the
gallery last year and it was a privilege to be among you as we all stood at our
speakers support to raise to stand up and applaud the findings and the vote for
them. So I ask for your humble support for this compensation resolution for Mr. Cluck.
Are there any questions? I don't see any votes to pleasure in the committee. We have a motion
And a second, for due pass of LC-60-005
to House Resolution 1-29, all those in favor say aye.
Any opposed?
Motion carried.
Next up is House Resolution 1-28, Chairman Dempsey.
This is also for another case that
happened in this similar time frame with many of the same people
involved through the courts and legal system, an investigative system.
For Mr. Joseph Joey, Samuel Watkins, Mr. Watkins was accused of a crime where he was not
even present.
The record show, when uncovered in a truthful way, that he could not have physically been
in a car in the same space where the victim was shot in another car.
He was 18 years old at the time, yeah, the case involved, juror misconduct during deliberations
of juror conducted an erroneous drive test involving cell evidence prompting her to convict
the other jurors and to let them know of the test when you are a juror, you are not supposed
to do that.
Buried evidence, the state failed to disclose that the police request the GBI extracted a
bullet from a dog found near the victim's grave, compared it to the nine-millimeter bullet
recovered from Mr. Dawkins' determining it did not match, yet the state agrargued.
Mr. Watkins committed both crimes as a signature or a calling card to place this dog on the
grave of the victim.
fault statement of testimony at trial by a GBI investigation's analyst gave
objectively false testimony relating to forensic tests conducted on the
grave dog. The state also asserted that no bullet was extracted from the dog and
thus its caliber wasn't known despite the fact that the GBI analyst had
brought the bullet to court. There are a lot of things going on at this time
in both of these cases involved.
Some pretty sad situations.
One of the, I would say, one of the most pivotal people
involved is not a lot today.
He's deceased, but before that happened,
he lost his post-certification for other incidents
that he had been involved in.
A humbly ask that you once again, as you did before,
support Mr. Watkins last year on the floor,
this was passed by a vote of 162 yeses
two notes. Are there any questions? No question? All right. What is the pleasure of the committee?
Emotion of the second to do pass LC 60 0 0 5 1 H R 128 all those in favor say aye.
Why?
Any opposed?
Motion carries.
Motion carries.
Thank you.
I think that's it.
That's all.
We're adjourned.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
