You
Well good morning. Friday morning last day of the work week. Unless it extends into

We're all good morning members because a good Friday, I think it's day 40 last I checked,

All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber.

All members voted.
Now, I'll vote, it.
All members voted.
If so, this clerk will you lock the machines?
Well, good Friday morning again.
Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed?
As is our custom here in the house, we will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer
by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
This morning I have the great honor and distinction to bring you our chaplain of the day.
He's my pastor, Jay Williams.
Jay is accompanied by some very important people in his life, and they're sitting right
down to my right.
One of his daughters, he has two daughters, one of them is paging today, and y'all will
see Annabelle.
She's a beautiful young lady.
She'll be here.
No, there she is right there.
I'm sorry.
She joined the sunflow of Annabelle, hadn't seen you this morning.
But the other light of his life is sitting with Miss Dale, as a young lady named Lily
two other important ladies are with him one of them assures that his life goes
pretty smoothly and that's his mother-in-law Molly Scott thank you Molly for being
here but his dear wife and one of the leaders in our church is his wife
I mean, do you health care professional who takes care of many folks up at
screving county health systems in Sylvania, but also as a caretaker of many
folks, slides, spiritually and physically in our church, down at Misba, down in
the Clio community down in Northern F and Him County. Let me tell you about our
pastor today. He actually grew up with Chairman Matt Hatchett. He turned out
pretty good in spite of that. But he and Matt were pretty close neighbors down in
Dublin when they grew up. I'll tell you a lot about Jay from the standpoint of
his service over the years and in the South Georgia conference and now with us
at MISBA. He served with distinction. He served with passion and compassion to his
flock. He's been a teacher in the public school system, but he's been a leader in God's house
his entire life. Like many of us, he's had a time or two, getting started and he had to get
it the right direction, but he's accomplished that and he's made a difference in his own life
for his family's life and in many, many other people's lives. My family then have attended
this 159-year-old church. No, I haven't been there 159 years. Thank you very much, Al.
But he's made a difference in our church. He's grown our church. He's, he brings God's
Word and that's what it's all about. So without further ado, my pastor, Pastor J. Williams,
That's our chapter of the day, Jay.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir.
Speaker and distinguished representatives of this beautiful state of Georgia.
I want to begin by telling you, thank you, thank you so much.
It's an immense honor to be before you today in this place and at this time.
I also want to express a deep gratitude for all that you do here.
I can't even begin to fathom what you juggle to serve our state or your personal sacrifices
that you give to be here.
I may understand the basics of the legislative process, but the entirety of the experience,
the weight of it, is astounding to consider.
You serve the great state of Georgia and your district and all matters as it applies to
state and government.
I know what that really means is you have thousands of people telling you what they want
you to do.
you can't please them all. You also live in a fishbowl. You live under the scrutiny of
the press, your peers, and people that don't even know you. And the truth of the matter
is, is none of us are perfect. You face acceptance, rejection, and conflicting ideas every day.
And you shoulder all that while still managing the business of this state. And on top of that,
You have the complexity of your own lives, your own internal struggles, your own family
lives.
It's a greater undertaking than anyone can understand at just a casual glance.
That being said, it's important to have a 40-day session.
And more importantly, it's important to have an ending day of a 40-day session.
So just like that, I want to tell you this, it's important because this is an all-consuming
job. And if you didn't have a 40-day session, there's no telling where we may end up.
In the Bible, just like here, the number 40 is significant. There are many 40-day periods
that are mentioned in Scripture. There are usually periods of trial, testing, and preparation.
Let's look at some of them. Know about the grace of God injured the flood for 40 days. Moses
was on the mountain top, receiving the law for 40 days. And Jesus was in the desert, tempted
by Satan for 40 days and Jesus was after his resurrection and after his crucifixion death
and resurrection he walked the earth and before sending into heaven he walked the earth
for 40 days. I'm sure some of you can relate. Some of you like Noah having endured a flood
of challenges over the past 40 days. Although it's not quite over, the dove is up. Some
Some of you like Moses have been on the mountain top and you've received your legislation and
the people didn't quite respond the way you wanted them to.
Some of you feel like you've literally been in the desert with the same guy that Jesus
was.
I pray that you pass the test and that you didn't give into his trap.
And some of you are simply waiting for the end of day 40 so you can go to that little
place of heaven called home.
This is what I want to say to you today on this final day, that there's hope.
There's hope in this session and there's hope in the signing die.
There's hope in the end, in the end of the 40, in the adjourning.
There's hope in the remainder of this day and the possibilities that it holds and there's
hope in the promise rest in its end.
I can't begin to understand the weariness that comes from your schedule.
The pressures to please the masses and the looming threat of being replaced if you don't.
And then there's the necessity of staying true to what you know is right in the process.
It's in this complex context that our state brings its problems to you.
While you have protocols to address these problems, what about the ones that are too big
for even this house?
The ones that are beyond your reach with implications that are far too heavy to bear, yet the decisions
still have to be made.
what of your own burdens, the ones that are too heavy to carry
alone. An old hymn comes to mind. There is a place a quiet
rest near to the heart of God. Scripture says it like this,
Jesus said, Come to me, all you who are weak and are heavy
laden and I will give you rest. Forty is the number of days
in this session, but forties also a metaphor for life. It's a
time of trial and testing and preparation, there's a promise for those that will respond
to Christ's offer.
We don't have to face it alone, there's one greater in whom we can rest.
The promise is that if we walk with Him, we can have internal rest during the session.
And at the end of it, we can have ultimate rest in our own personal, signy die.
As we move through today and toward the close of this session, I say thank you so much
for the work that you've done and the work that you're still doing. I invite you to find peace
in knowing that you're not alone in this journey. Whether you carry the burdens of this state
or your own personal burdens, there's an invitation to pause. An invitation to respond to Jesus is
called arrest in someone that is trustworthy, someone that is greater than us, someone that is
greater than our circumstances, to rest in the one who holds it all together and let him direct
and care you throughout this day. Again, I thank you for all that you do and all that you endure
for this state. I pray that as you find rest in the nearings of God that you do so in this final
session, I also pray that you do it in your lives out beyond this session. I pray that you're blessed
in the adjourning, most immediately in the adjourning of this session, but more importantly,
as you prepare for your ultimate and final home going.
There's hope in the session and hope in the Sinai die.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak here today
and thank you for the chance to share the truth of God's Word
and for the privilege of proclaiming the hope that's found in the name of Jesus.
I pray that you rest in it in the rest of this session
and also in the Sinai die. Let's pray.
Father, as I stand before these people in my heart is heavy, my Father, they have worked
so hard. They have done their best, Father God, to please their constituents, Father, and
to do what's right. And Father God, I know it's a huge job. I pray today that as they go
through this marathon day, Lord, that you're in the middle of it. I pray, Father God, that
you anoint them to walk in peace and love with one another. And Father, I pray that
your will be done. Father God, I thank you so much for the fact that you put them in
the place that they're in today. Father, use them for your glory. Father God, and for
the betterment of this state. Father God, thank you for their leadership. I pray you bless
them in Jesus' name. Amen. Please join me in the
friends are leading.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands.
One nation got indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Excellent.

Today, I rise to honor the life and memory of the very reverend
father, Dor Shukri Mahloof.
Father George was born in Palestine as one of almost a million
Palestinian-necked-best survivors.

Representative Willis.
Representative Willis, you got somebody coming with you?
Yes, one moment.
Good morning, Georgia.
On this wonderful day, as we speak about the dream of Dr. King, it is my absolute honor
to acknowledge the youngest certified farmer in the United States of America.
That is Miss Kindle Ray Johnson, a stand before you with the chairman of the
Agriculture Committee. We would also like to congratulate you for being a
maize. Congratulations, thank you all. I hope you're much
successful in the future. We are extremely proud of you my sister and I look
forward to meeting you down here for photos. We just wanted to recognize you and
your family. Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker, are you at the well?
It's pretty cool. Agriculture. Thank you. Thank you for being involved in
the act. Thank you. Come on down to the third floor and you can come down and certainly
a family can come down and get some photos with Representative Willis and
the Chairman of Ag, Chairman Dickie, Representative Sharper.
There's a lot of people here.
The Dicks to Sharper is recognized
a gentleman from Valdosta.
His hair matches his suit.
Today, absolutely.
Or his suit matches his hair.
I'm not sure.
Platinum blonde.
Platinum blonde, you got that right.
We're together on that one.
The gentleman is recognized.
If you guys don't mind,
We passed the bill in the house regarding more safety for the ice cream trucks and everything.
And we have the family of the young man, and you see the photo here,
very precious child. When I saw it, my heart went out because the simple thing is,
I was looking at IG and I'm going to try to be brief.
And as I was looking at Instagram and I saw this video of a young lady doing her
child's hair getting them ready for the funeral and I saw a lot of different
comments about the strength and I saw the strength in that mother sitting there
preparing her child for the funeral with her hands. She's very talented
what she does, but she was preparing her child for the funeral, and that just did something
to me. And I want to get involved and say, you know, the strength of a mother like that
is just unbelievable, but I know that women, for one, they do what they have to do no matter
what. So I respect that I'm not going to read the entire thing, but I'm just going to read
a little bit of this, honoring the life of memory of Ocarian, the white
Perry, and supporting further actions to improve ice cream
truck safety in Georgia and for other purposes. The state of
Georgia mourns the tragic loss of Ocarian, the white
Perry, a beloved child whose life was taken too soon in a heart
breaking accident when a vehicle went around and stopped, I went
around to stop ice cream truck and struck him. There's an
opportunity to improve our ice cream truck safety by require in-hats signage and
other morning signs to alert drivers to proceed with caution when passed next
stop ice cream truck and we did that here in the house. In honor of a Corian
Dwight Perry this body is dedicated to exploring new policies that could
include improved visibility measures and public awareness in initiative to
encourage safer driving practice around ice cream trucks.
Now therefore be resolved by the House of Representatives
that the members of this body join in honoring the memory
of a Korean Dwight Harry expressing their deepest condolences
to his family and express their support for legislative
efforts that enhance ice cream trucks safety
to prevent future accidents.
So be resolved that the House of the Clerk, the Representatives,
is authorized and directed to make appropriate copies
of this resolutions available for distribution to your family,
of accordion to white parry, of state agencies
and public and the press.
So we appreciate you guys being here, the whole family is here.
We thank you, and our heart continues to be with you.
And forever with this Georgia House,
We thank you so much.
Thank you so much for being the strong woman
and the kids.
All you guys, thank you so much.
And let's do a brief moment of momela's silence, people.
Thank you.
Thank you, and thank you, Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Dexter Sharper.
To the family, I will continue to know
that this is our prayers are with you.
Sorry for your loss.
And hopefully that this house stands behind that legislation.
Hopefully it gets across that finish line.
But we'll keep working.
Thank y'all, and y'all do as well.
Take care.

Representative Bruce Williamson has recognized for a motion.
I can just speak or I move that the House except the Senate substitute to House Bill 586.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 586 to be tied to a men article three, chapter six, title 48.
I believe if you go to Georgia annotated relating the intangible recording tax it was revised the note for which such taxes imposed
Chairman Williamson is recognized explained this Senate substitute to House Bill 586
Thank you, Mr. Speaker colleagues if you recall House Bill 586
Simply let me back up a second so right now under the current Georgia code if you borrow money
It is secured by a deed to secure debt for over three years.
There's a $3 per 1,000 recording tax.
This bill simply moves that exemption period from three years up to 62 months,
which is five years and two months.
The happy answer in the question is not Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well.
The gentleman has no questions.
Thank you.
All the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 586, House Bill 586, all those in favor, but yes, those opposed will vote no in, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
We have all members voted.
All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk.
When you lock the machine on the general's motion, the yeas are 161, the days are zero.
And this house has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 586.
Chairman Rees is recognized for a motion.
Chairman Rees, excuse me, representative Rees, I was giving you a promotion.
Thank you, Speaker Burns.
I move to agree to the Senate substitute for House Bill 131.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 131 to be entitled back to a men article 5 of chapter 4, title 10 of the
Fisher go to Georgia and tell you relating to self-service storage facilities.
Representative Reeves is recognized to explain the Senate substitute to House Bill 131.
Thank you, Speaker Burns.
House Bill 131 unanimously passed the House.
This bill brings a self-storage industry in line with 30 other states.
There were some articulate business women who came in and represented the 15 self-storage units.
The Senate Committee made a minor amendment pertaining to boats and RVs and campers and vehicles that are sometimes at storage units.
That's it. That is the only change.
It was a grieble to all parties involved and I would request your favorable support.
We have a couple of questions if you'll take them.
I will, Mr. Speaker.
Minority leader Hewglie to your left out front
is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
To the leader I do.
Thank you so much.
I've got a concern that was sent to me in the true
that if three independent bidders attend the sale
at the time and place advertised,
it's need to be commercially reasonable.
Is that still in the spill?
It is the three bidders, that is longstanding law.
The sale cannot be finalized until you have at least three bidders.
Also, all of the notice provisions, the due process to the delinquent customer,
those are not changed whatsoever in this bill.
This bill merely adjusts the advertisement procedures to bring in line with 30 other states.
And what is the advertisement requirement, if you don't mind?
to commercially reasonable so you can run a newspaper out,
you can run online, you can do social media,
you can do advertising through, you know,
placing signs out there for regular sales.
So there are a variety of ways it's done,
but they've got to get at least three bidders
for the sales.
Mr. Speaker, if there are two.
Rimsley Park, Ken and Rick and I have a little question.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You yield to the representative. I do thank you. What impact does this have on urban business owners?
It has a positive impact on urban business owners as well as the customers of self-storage because
This outdated procedure that Georgia has on the ads if you have a delinquency in a unit it delays
Filling that unit up to a paying customer and also if you think about the customers of self-storage
You have senior citizens, people who have gone through divorce, students, other people who are on the move, and this red tape that we've got in this area that 30 other states have improved on, that will save money if we change it to bring it into national standards. It's good for consumers.
Thank you.
If you release the camels, recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield to the representative I do?
Thank you.
I just wanted to clarify, it looks like one other change to me
online, 116, that the notice of advertisement
actually has been reduced to once versus once for two weeks.
Correct, absolutely four.
And that is something to clarify for boats, RVs, vehicles,
things like that that you've got to give notice for.
They're still as a newspaper ad required one time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, has there further questions?
Are you the well?
Jim was you to the well.
On the Jim was motion to the House agree
to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 131.
All those in favor will vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no.
And the clerk will unlock the machines.
Mr. Speaker, I request to be excused from this vote, according to rule 133.
The gentleman has that right and the journal will so reflect.
Have all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine.
All the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 163, the nae is one.
The house has agreed to the Senate's substitute, the house bill 131.
Representative Rob Leveritt is recognized for a motion, Chairman Leveritt.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
I'm hoping to have the cheat sheet up there on the screen, but I believe what I'm doing is moving to agree to the Senate substitute the House Bill 36.
Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption, House Bill 36, correct?
House Bill 36 to be entitled, an act to amend title 29 of the Fisher go to George Antony relating to guardian and awards.
It was revised list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult.
We're representative Liberty is recognized to explain his motion.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the bill that would add a number of professions to the list of
those that can provide an evaluation in a guardianship or a conservatorship proceeding.
You remember there was a lot of drama on the floor as the representative Evans I had
an interesting exchange on this bill.
I believe House Media Service is going to set that video to doing banjos to make a good
soundtrack with it, but I believe I've addressed all of her concerns.
What I have done is added provisions that make it clear that the proposed ward, that
is the person who would be the subject of the guardianship or conservatorship, can it
any time challenge the qualifications, experience or manner of the performance of the evaluation
during the hearing or at the outset of the proceeding
to stop it from going forward.
Additionally, for the Council on Developmental Disabilities,
we added some language that made it clear
that adult mental disability itself
is not a reason for granting a guardianship.
And finally, in the Senate, they made an amendment
that removed marriage and family therapists
from the list of those who can do the evaluation
so that profession is no longer included in the bill.
We believe this is essential legislation.
We really want to get it passed this year
so that the backlogs in these cases can be addressed,
and the probate judges can find qualified people
who perform these evaluations,
so I'd ask for your favorable consideration of the bill.
Gentlemen, you?
Yes, sir.
Representative Evans, Taci Evans to your left,
is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, I do.
Isn't it true that I really appreciate you working
with me and us being able to work through some changes
to make this bill better?
I would hope that's the case,
because that's certainly how I feel.
I appreciate your engaging on it with.
Thank you.
Will you yield for one more?
Yes, ma'am.
Is it also true that throughout this process,
I think we've both learned, or at least I have learned,
that our probate judges need a lot more support from us
and help, and I look forward to working in the off season
to try to help their job be a little bit easier
for the citizens of Georgia.
The lady knows of what she speaks,
and I look forward to that collaboration also.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Riverside Park, Ken, does lady have a question?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Do you yield?
Thank you for this legislation. Would you agree that this does not expand the scope of practice of a nurse practitioner
But it does recognize their expertise
Absolutely, that is precisely correct. Thank you for that question
General has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your favor
Support of the motion with regard to House Bill 36
On the gentleman's motion that House agree to the Senate's substitute to House bill 36 all those in favor
Yes, those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines?
We have all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines
All in the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 165, the nays are two.
This house has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 36.
Representative Leverd has recognized for a motion.
Hello again, Mr. Speaker.
I move that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 37.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House bill 37 to be entitled back to amend sub part two, part six, particle six to chapter two, titled 20, the physical to Georgia and Tate relating to conditions of employment in elementary and secondary education.
Mr. Chairman, liberty is recognized to explain his motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, this was the bill from last year that we
try to get this year that simply requires school districts to provide notice to employees
concerning whether self-security is being withheld, because as you may recall from the initial
discussion, school districts are not required to participate.
Some of them do.
Some of them don't.
There's differing practice across the state.
trying to make sure that our school district employees
aren't met with any unpleasant surprises upon retirement.
Over in the Senate, they did make one change.
They added a provision concerning that is not mandatory.
It just authorizes school districts
who are providing insurance to their board members
that they can also provide family coverage
to those board members, you know,
under whatever terms, requiring the family to pay in
or the board member to pay also.
It's not mandatory, it's simply permissive
and it's intended to provide statutory authorization
for a practice that's already in existence.
So we are fine with that amendment.
I will ask you to support the motion.
I'll be answering your questions.
Gentlemen has a question or two,
represent a berry of the center aisle just to your left.
Gentlemen's recognized.
Thank you.
Thank you for speaking to the gentleman, you.
Yes, sir.
Is this done anywhere else in the country?
It's kind of bureaucratic burden of reporting every five years
that there are anywhere else in this country
is just the first nation trying to be in Georgia.
And I'm sorry, I cannot understand the question.
Was this, is this kind of law done anywhere else in this country,
or is this just a Georgia-specific issue?
I'm not aware that other states have the original law
that was in the original bill.
This was, I guess, this is our innovation.
Okay, thank you.
We're up to the burden now.
To your left is also a recognizable question.
Ladies recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, that's gentleman you.
Yes, ma'am.
Now when would they have to let the employees know?
Well, the bill tries to be fairly specific.
Upon hiring, they have to be notified whether the school district is going to be withholding.
If they do not, they have to notify the employee of some other available plans that would provide sort of a replacement if you will force those security additional retirement plans.
Then they've got to give them notice periodically through employment every five years.
And then at termination, they have to say whether they withheld or not.
Thank you.
So we're hoping they'll get the message with this one.
Gentlemen, you, for one more historical question,
gentlemen, was there where they created Social Security
to your left, Representative Williams,
has recognized for a question.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate you letting me in the door, when I got there.
Two shades.
Well, the gentleman, you-
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that over the last twenty or thirty years, though there was some initial
resistance. Minimum tied teachers are very glad that they signed up for so
security because those that didn't left a lot of money on the table. I'm sure
that's the case. Thank you for the question.
Gentlemen has a further question and that gentleman knows of what he speaks to
just ask that question for sure. I want a serious note. Yes. Miss Bigger I
just asked the body statement of consideration all year the well.
and gentlemen as you order the well.
On the gentleman's motion that the House agree
to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 37,
all those in favor will vote yes.
Those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk,
will you unlock the machines?
Have all members voted?
All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machines?
All the Germans motion, the Yees are 163, the Nays are zero, and the House has agreed
to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 37.
but the deflemming has recognized for a motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I move that the House agreed to the Senate substitute
to House Bill 150.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 150 to be entitled
to amend part two of Article II,
Chapter 3, Title 20,
the official code of George Antony
relating the university system.
So it's required a quarterly reports regarding certain
funding received from individuals
or entities related to China.
Mr. Speaker, as you all recall, House members, HP 150 deals with funding that comes from
foreign countries of concern to our higher education institutions, requires institutions
to report to this body, the Senate and the governor, what those funds are and where they
come from.
In the Senate, they changed the reporting dates from quarterly to twice a year to align
with other reporting that the USG system schools have,
and set the cap at $1,000 for any contribution
of $1,000 to be reported,
and explain for what those dollars are for.
Just to remind you, this does not pertain to any tuition
from individuals from these countries,
it's just other funding.
And with that, Mr. Speaker,
I'd have you taking questions or I'll yield the well.
Gentlemen's has a couple of questions of your yield.
Yes, we'll park right in front of it to your left
as we recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Is it not true that I am concerned about the Senate amendment that reduces the amount
from 50,000 to 1,000 precisely because in committee we were talking about the burden
this would put on our USG, TCSG institutions, in which case due to this amendment I would
encourage all members to vote no. Is that not true?
I know that you're concerned, yes sir.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, as a gentleman yield, is it one thing that we have been discussing
about this bill is my concern that when we keep our focus so narrow, we might actually
miss the force for the trees.
In this particular instance, by only focusing on a few countries, we actually don't have
an idea of where any other foreign investments might be coming from, and that my hope is that
The bills like this would be more broad to actually deal with the issue at hand here.
Yes, the lady not have to discuss that, thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the way.
Representative Jasmine Clark was recognized for a question.
Already had her button pushed if you don't mind.
Yes, sir.
The lady's recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman you.
Yes, ma'am.
I guess to add on to the question asked by my colleague with Park, what was the Senate's reasoning for
decreasing the cap from 50,000, which we thought was reasonable because it would not be as
burdensome to our USG systems, to the 1,000, which could probably trigger a lot of work,
administrative work for someone in USG.
Or if you recall, my original bill that was in committee, we didn't have any cap on it.
It was zero cap, so any figure coming from any funding coming would be happy or reported.
I'm not so sure what they're reasoning for, but my original bill had had no cap on it.
All right, thank you.

Jim was recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back with the mini-truck bill.
The Senate and all of its wisdom decided to add a few pieces to this bill.
The first is current law states that if you are caught road racing or I believe they
they called it, doing donuts, reckless driving, law
currently allows your vehicle to be impounded permanently
or crushed.
This amendment, however, allows the judge's discretion
to add a governor device to your car that limits you
to only 20% over the current speed limit.
The other amendment in here is a representative's amendment
are bill earlier that allows it for when people are pulled over for speeding for a
de-escalation aspect of the law to not have to sign the ticket.
They will, the ticket will put on their refusal to sign and that is the general of the amendment.
The gentleman has a couple of questions if you're yield.
Yes sir, I'll yield for one question.
Chairman Parsons was first to your left as recognized for a question.
Speaker. It's gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I would just like to ask you. I think he said to one of the
Chains they made in the Senate was they had a provision that a driver could add a governor
device to his car. Is that correct? It would at the judge's discretion, instead of having their car
impounded permanently or again crushed and destroyed, they can have a governor added to it so that
they can get their car back but will be limited to the speed that they can drive. Would you further yield?
Yes, sir. I'm just curious isn't it true?
How
How available or what kind of process you have to go through to get a governor
I've never we I've never looked for one, but are they readily available? Are they very expensive?
I'm not aware but I do believe that anything would be better than having your car lost forever
If the cost of the product is more expensive than the car itself
You're more than welcome to decline and have your car taken away from you
but this is just another option in order for people to keep their car instead of having to take it away.
Well, if you, I would, isn't it true, it just seemed like before you vote on something we shouldn't know what kind of
expensive it would add to somebody in case that they did have to or if it made some kind of a problem for a family or
whatever because a lot of times, you know, it's not just the individual or his individual family, but his parents and
grandparents have to pay for these things.
Is that not true? Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, you yield one more question. I think I can get the answer to that question. Yes, sir
I'll yield for one more question
Representative Jason Ridley's has some experience here limited to speed
I think he might know how much it costs Jim was recognized for a question is gentleman yield. Yes, sir
Is it not true that the device is a new device that just came out almost kind of like the one that they do on a DUI?
We do a breathalyzer
But what this right here does is it's attached your car
car and it's a couple hundred dollars a month that most and what that does is the judge
could make you make you have it on there for three to six months and then you be able
to keep your car and be able to get back for the work.
Absolutely.
Again, this is an alternative instead of having your car gone forever and never having
it back.
This is alternative to being able to keep your car and drive a limited speed limit.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well.
Gentlemen's yielded the well.
