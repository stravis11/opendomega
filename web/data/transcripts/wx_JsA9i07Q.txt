----------
Welcome everyone to Japan Day at the Capitol. Governor Mrs. Kim, Commissioner Wilson, former
governor of Diel, Council General Maeda, Mrs. Maeda, thank you so much for being with
us today and all of our other honored guests including Senators and Representatives.
I'm Senator Kay Kirkpatrick and I'm the Senate Co-Chair of the Georgia-Japan Caucus
and the General Assembly.
The other co-chairs are standing up here with me today.
Welcome everyone, and welcome to all the companies
that have joined us today, both outside in the rain
and inside, and where it's nice and warm and dry,
including my favorite personal favorite company,
Toto, made right in Heyville.
To all of you, thanks very much for joining us
as we celebrate 50 years of the consulate general of Japan's office in Georgia.
Over these many years, this important relationship has grown significantly.
Georgia has welcomed many Japanese companies with a huge economic impact on our state.
I've had the opportunity to visit Japan and I greatly appreciate our state's mutually
beneficial economic and cultural cooperation.
If you've not had the chance to visit,
the annual Japan Fest that's held every fall
at the gas out the arena in Gwyneth County
will give you a very good taste of Japanese culture.
This year's event is September 14th and 15th, I believe.
We were proud to present a resolution
to console General Maeda and the House and the Senate today.
Our state's leadership has appreciated the importance
of the state's relationship with Japan over the years.
In fact, Georgia's first international trade office
was established in Tokyo in 1973,
and a delegation from Georgia celebrated
the 50 years of this office in 2023.
Most recently, Governor Brian Kemp and First Lady Kemp
have been extremely supportive of the ties between Japan
and the state of Georgia.
Our Governor understands the importance of positioning Georgia for success by attracting
businesses from Japan and other nations friendly to our country.
With Governor Kim's leadership, Georgia continues to thrive and grow where the envy of
states across the country, and like any successful endeavor, the success or failure of any enterprise
starts at the top.
I've worked with a governor and the first lady on many issues during his term, and it
is no surprise that our state is in the hands of a person of integrity, honesty, and determination,
even when his decisions are unpopular.
This combination has led to unprecedented success for our state.
I know you are all anxious to hear from our very busy governor, so without further delay,
I'm happy to introduce the 83rd Governor of Georgia, Brian Peak-Kemp for his remarks.
Well, thank you, Senator, I didn't realize I'd made any unpopular decisions, but much
like my predecessor, Governor Deal, didn't either.
It is an honor to be here this morning.
I want to thank you for the kind introduction and for the support of the members of the
General Assembly, Councilor General, it's honor to have you here with us at the Capitol.
We are proud to welcome you all to the best state in America for business.
The first lady and I are just excited to be with you this morning, and I just want to
recognize Governor Dele has been such a strong supporter of Japan and a strong supporter
that a business in our state has started our run on 10 consecutive years for the number
one state in the country for business, so Governor's good to have you back with us.
Again, I want to thank the members of the General Assembly for your strong support.
I know Governor Dill would echo that the General Assembly's partnership with the executive
branch in making this business friendly environment is unprecedented.
Also glad to have the best commissioner for economic development in the country.
We've got Wilson Wilson today, Pat and his team, especially our colleagues that are serving
in the international marketplace and places like Japan have just done an incredible job
representing our state, but also facilitating trade and economic development between the
state of Georgia and Japan.
I want to start by offering my condolences on behalf of all Georgians for the victims
of the recent earthquake, and we will continue to have your people in our thoughts and prayers
as they recover from this disaster.
You know, when I look around the room, I see a lot of partners that are with us today,
and that is certainly something that we value in Georgia, and it represents the approach
that we take at every level from all the way from local governments that we have good
partnerships to also our partners on the international level. That approach has
served us very well in this state and I know it will continue to do so in the
future. And we're seeing the fruits of that. International investments were
responsible for 47% of the jobs and 65% of the total investment in our state in
in 2022, our trade was over $196 billion across 211 countries and territories, and we broke
our previous records by nearly $5 billion. Thanks to our ports on the Georgia coast, which
continues to be one of the fastest growing U.S. container terminals in the country. Japan
has been a prominent part of that success now going back 50 incredible years.
Today we're celebrating the Japanese Consulate first coming to Atlanta in 1974, but as you
can imagine, our history goes back even further.
The state of Georgia opened its first ever foreign trade and investment office in Tokyo
the year before in 1973, and even before these official assets were opened, multiple companies
decided to come to Georgia. YKK, the zipper company, broke ground on a factory
and making way back in December of 1972, and in 1973, Marata Manufacturing opened its
operations in Smurna. Economic ties like these between our state and the
nation of Japan have only grown and streaked the number over the past five
decades. In fact, Japan currently serves Georgia's number one international
employer and that translates to tens of thousands of jobs for people all
across our state. Just over the past 10 years alone, Japanese operations have
brought over $4 billion of investment to our state and trade between Georgia
in Japan, now stocks $9.75 million annually.
Those are just a few of the benefits
that come from the partnerships you see represented
in this room.
So again, I wanna thank the Council of General,
the members of the General Assembly,
who helped us further this important relationship,
the team from the Department of Economic Development,
who are always available to help you
or answer any questions that you may have
into those, all of those who had a hand
and making today possible.
We are proud to be your partners,
and we look forward to growing this friendship
even more in the months and years ahead.
So here's to another 50 years of shared success.
Congratulations.
Applause.
Council general, I'd like to present you
a commendation on behalf of the state of Georgia
for an incredible partnership.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Mr. Freeman.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Governor Kent, for your leadership and all that you do for Georgia, especially
continuing the legacy of making Georgia the number one business, the state to do business
in the nation.
And with that being said, you've got to have great leaders and one of our great leaders
with the Georgia Department of Economic Development is Pat Wilson, he's an old friend and he
He is certainly one of the cornerstones that knows more about international trade in
business and has been part of the success and again a governor deal, I believe he grew
up under your administration and was there early.
2010 is the Deputy Commissioner of Global Commerce.
He served as the CEO of the Georgia Department of Economic Development and Commissioner since
2016 and again that record of 10 consecutive years of Georgia being the number one state to do business
We owe a great deal of gratitude to Pat Wilson and certainly he more than most knows the importance of our partnership with Japan with that Pat
Please. Thank you.
Chairman Knight, thank you so much.
Everybody, thank you for being here today.
Governor and First Lady, Governor Deal.
It's an honor to have you here today.
And David's right, I grew up under Governor Deal.
In fact, my first job out of college was in Washington
within Congressman Deal.
And he was the reason that I stuck around.
So thank you, Governor.
the Japan caucus. Thank you guys for organizing today. This is an unbelievable
opportunity to celebrate one of our most important partnerships. So happy
Japan day everybody. This is this is really fantastic. It's an honor to be here
to celebrate what Japan has meant to Georgia and that's our individual
companies its communities and it's the citizens of this state in literally
every corner. So if there's one thing that's clear and I think the governor
talked about that is that Georgia and Japan value long-term partnerships. So in 1973,
Governor Jimmy Carter opened office in Tokyo, soon thereafter, Japan opened office in Atlanta,
and from there that partnership blossomed. It's kind of like a cherry tree. But beginning
Working with YKK, investing in making, Japanese companies have followed, they've believed
in us, and they've invested in us.
And so in cities like Gainesville, Pindergrass, Monroe, Noonan, Dublin, and many others,
these companies have now become part of who we are as Georgians.
They've become part of the fabric of our communities.
And for that, we are grateful.
So as the governor said, more than 400 Japanese companies employ more than 40,000 Georgians.
Y'all, those are individual lives of people.
Those are families that have hope and they have opportunities that are inherent in having
a job.
So thanks to the hard work of Jessica Kork, the Japan-America Society of Georgia and many
others a peace belt tower was built in 2022 in the Carter Center to house the
Konu peace belt. If y'all have not seen it you need to go see it yourself it is
a beautiful exhibit and really a cultural peace that ties our two countries
together. So last year as we celebrated 50 years of Georgia in Tokyo I had the
opportunity with a delegation to go ring that peace belt and to visit Konu the
The original home, we got to ring the replacement bell.
So that was an honor, but it was an unbelievably moving experience that highlighted how important
our two countries are culturally and economically to each other.
So from WAKK, our first investor to Yacult, our most recent investor, and I am a convert
if you haven't tried it, it's fantastic.
Today we get to say thank you.
So, Council General Mehta, thank you from the Department of Economic Development and the
many communities around the state that have been benefited from this important relationship.
Thank you.
Happy Japan Day and Happy Birthday to the Council.
Really appreciate it.
Hello everyone, I am State Representative Terry Anelo-Witz.
I am the House co-chair of the Georgia-Japan Caucus, and it is such an honor and a privilege
to be here today with so many of our friends from the Japanese community in Georgia with
the Japan-American Society of Georgia.
I see so many people who have been at the honor of visiting their facilities, traveling
on the state. I've had the privilege to travel to Japan twice now most recently with my family
and I echo everyone who is going to urge you if you can experience Japanese hospitality,
whether it is by visiting Japan or by going to the Japan Fest here in Atlanta, I highly encourage
you. I'm here today to introduce Consul General Miyamaeda. He is here with us along with his wife
Council General Maeda was posted to Atlanta in the
Southeastern United States in November of 2002.
He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan in 1990, and during that time his
postings have ranged from Switzerland, Vietnam, Italy, and Afghanistan.
This is his first posting in the United States, and since he has joined us in 2022, he has
been an absolutely steadfast partner and friend to us here in Georgia. He has
been such an advocate to again continue to strengthen the friendship that we
have between the state of Georgia and the nation of Japan. It is my honor to
introduce him today, Consul General Mio Maeda.
Thank you very much for the kind introduction and well thank you very much
for all of you today to attend this ceremony.
Well, first of all, I'd like to express my sincere condolences
to the victims of the Noto Peninsula aspect,
which occurred New Year's Day.
And also I'd like to express my sincere sympathies
to those who are still suffering from the disasters
We still have a lot of people who are facing difficulties and we do hope that they will resume their daily life as soon as possible.
And once again, thank you very much for inviting me to this very important event.
Well, as Therese mentioned, I've been here for just one year, one year, two months.
So I'm very, I've said, young, young here.
And the construction offices has 50 years old.
So it has a long history, but I really feel that it's a great honor to be posted here,
because Georgia and Japan,
Japanese community here has established a four-star,
very good and friendly relationship between us.
And for that, I really appreciate the warm,
warm and the hospitality we received
our Japanese community received
from the people of Georgia and state of Georgia.
And for that, I really, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.
And also, we have a 50th history, but we could be here for 50 years because we have a lot of good Japanese community here.
And you can see that a lot of Japanese companies are here explaining their business and their
doings and without their effort, we couldn't be here today.
So again, I would like to express our sincere appreciation to those Japanese communities
and Japanese companies who have been so active and so effective and so keen to do business here.
So I'd like to ask you all of you to join with me to give them an applause.
And also I really appreciate the, well, we could be here because our predecessors has made
a great foundation for all of us to do business here and to stick in this great great state.
So I'd like to say a great appreciation to our predecessors, such as President Carter,
from Magabarandil as well, and other predecessors as well.
And based on that, as a Consul General of Japan in Atlanta, I'd like to continue or make
our best to continue our good friendship and also part to further enhance the good relations
between Japan and South-East in Japan and the state of Georgia. So I do wish that if you
lend us your valuable support to create more prosperous and friendly relations between
Japan and the state of Georgia to for the next next generations for the next
coming 50 years. So thank you very much I want to thank everyone for
coming today all of our partners if you'll forgive me for just one minute for
personal owner privilege. At the end of 2017, I had the privilege of being on the
first legislative delegation to actually travel to Japan. I think it was since
the Carter administration. And what an experience it was. I was introduced to
not only Japan as a country but to the culture and to the people. Constantine
General, I want to say what a beautiful country and I've said it before, what a
beautiful people, kind and welcoming. And I am absolutely a trip of a lifetime and
it absolutely open our eyes to why we are great partners and great friends with
Japan. I'll say this one more time. Not only economically or weak great partners
but globally Japan is very important to our country as a strategic partner.
And most of all, as we go back and focus on Georgia,
we every day see these companies and we use their products.
They employ Georgians.
It is a wonderful, wonderful partnership.
And General, behalf of the Georgia,
Japan Caucus, thank you, and I look forward
and wishing the best for the next 50 years
years as we continue to grow and grow together in that partnership.
Thank everyone for coming and we really, really appreciate you celebrating this day with us.
Thank you.
