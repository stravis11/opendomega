championship and for other purposes that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting the privilege resolutions the chair here's none in the resolutions are adopted?
All right, we're going back to the rules calendar
Going back to the rules calendar the clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 152
Senate bill 152 by Senator Robertson the 29th to go to the 30th Miller the 49th Gucci the 51st Kennedy the 18th and others
to be entitled an act to amend Article 1 of February 3 of Title 50 of the fiscal
to Georgia and attend to ruling the state and other flags so as to add
language to the pledge of allegiance to the state flag this bill I refer to
the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill
do pass. Chair recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill. Thank you
Mr. Speaker. On your desk, you'll see a handout that starts state seal. From my friend
representing Martin Mont de Han, this is not a coloring book. I know he wanted to color
on it. But this bill changes the pledge of the Georgia flag by adding one word. That
word is courage. Socrates, the Greek philosopher sought to put into words what qualifies, what
quality is the ideal state would possess. In Plato's work, Republic Socrates presented
four cardinal virtues that serve as a bedrock for a peaceful and flourishing
state. These four virtues are wisdom, justice, moderation, and courage. Now if you
recite to yourself the state pledge to the Georgia flag, you'll notice that
one of these cardinal virtues is missing. I know a number of you probably like
me initially were like, I didn't even know we had a state pledge, but we do. It
goes, I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag and their principles for which
to stay in wisdom, justice, and moderation.
Now back to those cardinal virtues.
Wisdom, justice, moderation, and courage.
As you notice, our pledge was misencouraged.
I've lived in Georgia my entire life,
and I can tell you that courage is not lacking in our state.
There's no better time than now, in fact,
to acknowledge that courage.
When you look at what our state's weathered the last two years,
when you consider the current state of the world,
there couldn't be a more ideal time
place to ensure that value of courage is reaffirmed. So a common question that
comes up doesn't this mean we need to change the state seal? The short answer is
no we do not. If you look at that handout I showed you earlier you'll see the
three pillars on the Georgia State Seal. These pillars represent the three of
the four cardinal virtues wisdom moderation and justice. However if you look at
the seal of fresh eyes you'll also see a soldier with his sword drawn ready to
to protect the Constitution of Georgia.
This soldier represents courage.
With this symbol of courage already in place in our seal,
adding the word to our state pledge will require no changes.
The cardinal virtues are incomplete without courage,
and so is our state pledge to the Georgia flag.
Happy to answer any questions.
You have a question, yes, a few questions if you care to yield.
I'll take one and we'll go from there.
How about Chair recognizes the Dean of the House, Dean Smiley, to your left for a question?
Gentlemen, you'll.
Of course.
I listen to your explanation very carefully and I just want to make sure I'm understanding.
You're only doing it in the narrative aspect of it,
but not on the seal itself.
I would, so that's true.
I would say the seal is already there.
It's that soldier with the sword.
So there's no change of anything.
This is just to change the pledge.
And I'm just telling you that the seal already has
courage on there by being that soldier with the sword.
Oh yeah, but it's not, the word courage is not the word.
It's not gonna be there.
We're not changing anything but the pledge.
Okay, that's, that's what I was trying.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
The gentleman has yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being
ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
As opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on
the passage of Senate Bill 152. The eyes are 125. The nays are 23. This bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 565.
Senate Bill 565, Senator Strickland of the 17th
group, Patrick, the 32nd Jones, the 22nd and others,
to be entitled to enact to amend Article 1 of Chapter 10
of Title 17, the official code of Georgia annotated
relating the procedure for sentencing
and imposition of punishment.
so to provide that at any time after conviction
for a misdemeanor felony offense,
a defendant convicted of an offense and sentenced
as a direct result of being a victim of trafficking
for labor or sexual servitude,
may petition the sentence in court to grant the relief.
This bill happened for a committee
on judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Hagen to present the bill.
Mr. Speaker, good afternoon everybody.
I hope you had a good lunch break.
I'm bringing to you Senate Bill 565.
This was Chairman Brian Strickland's bill.
This bill is another good step in the work that's been done here at the Capitol to address the heinous human trafficking problem that plagues our state and our country.
century. Currently Georgia code allows for vacating of sentences for victims of trafficking
if they can show that the crime was committed as a direct result of being trafficked.
This bill makes two changes to the code. It eliminates the waiting period for applying
to have the sentences vacated. Currently the waiting period is six months for misdemeanors
and no earlier than one year following completion
of sentences for felonies.
This bill would change that to say
that a victim may apply for make sure
at any time following their conviction and sentence
instead of having to wait.
Also, this bill confirms where the money comes from
if there are fines or fees that need to be reimbursed
to the defendant if the sentences are vacated.
It the bill says the defendant will be reimbursed out of the Georgia crime victims emergency fund and that money will be replaced back into that fund by
The entity that originally received it from the defendant. So that is the bill mr. Speaker
You have a question if you care to yield.
I will yield for one question.
Chair recognizes representative Lorichia to your ride for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speakers.
The general lady you.
I do yield.
Now is this your first bill?
I'm trying to remember if it is.
Thank you for pointing it out.
Well, I just wanted to see if I could get people awake after lunch.
But is it not true that you might have an opportunity to invite your colleagues
to the Vidalia Onion Festival?
I believe that's April the 21st through the 24th.
It is there's the correct dates and I plan to do a morning order maybe later this week on that but I appreciate you pointing out because we do invite all of you to
Vidal year for the onion festival
But thank you mr. Speaker do ask for your favorable favorable consideration of this bill and I yield the well
Lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection?
I've got another member that wished to be heard.
Chair recognizes Chairman Berschett to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I should have waved, but because I know my colleague did a fantastic job of explaining this bill.
But this is just updating our statute
to allow for quicker justice for people
that have been charged with a crime.
While under the undue influence of human trafficking,
I ask for your favorable consideration.
Congratulations on your first bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 438.
Senate Bill 438, the Senator Tipkins of the 37th,
Dugan of the 30th, Milo of the 49th,
Strickland of the 17th and others,
being taught an act to amend Article 2,
Chapter 10 and Title 13,

creation of escrow counts on contracts for the installation improvement maintenance of repair of water or sewer facilities this bill I
refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Gunter to
present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House Senate Bill 438
state, adjust, retainage amounts in public works, construction contracts.
It brings George in line with our neighboring southern states.
Under current law, state and local government can keep 10% retained until the project is
50% complete and then zero retains thereafter.
This law penalizes early construction providers who complete their work prior to the 50% completion.
So 438 has a flat 5% retaining threshold for all providers for the life of the project.
And all the construction groups that are involved in this approve of this bill.
And I'll yield for any questions.
You did not have any questions.
Thank you.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 337.
Senate Bill 337, I Senator Walker, the 20th,
due to the 51st of Patrick, the 32nd,
and of Arte and 31st and others,
we entitle an act to amend chapter 5 of,
title 45, the Episcopal to Georgia,
and Tateau relating to the invocation of office,
so it's required for the suspension of compensation
for certain public officers who are suspended
because of indictment for felony.
This bill haven't referred to the committee on government affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Bring to you guys Senate Bill 337.
This is a companion bill to the Senate resolution 134
that we passed last year and was signed by the governor.
This resolution will be on the ballot in November, so what this bill does is it addresses a problem
I've seen back home in Paulin County and I'm sure many of you have seen in your hometowns as well
It will make it so when a local public official is indicted for felony by a grand jury
And if subsequently suspended by the governor that their pay will be suspended as well
If they're reinstated to office, they are entitled to their back pay
Okay. Mr. Speaker, this bill is simple, straight forward, happy to answer any questions.
Anyone may have.
You have a question if you care to yield.
I will yield.
Chair recognizes representative McCloud to your left for a question.
There's a gentleman yield.
I do.
Okay, so overall this bill is pretty good.
What I'm concerned with is that if there is someone that's in the position or there was an election,
And you've got somebody new and you're going to reinstate this person that if something
when like was, they were wrongly accused, then you might have a situation where there's
two people in the same position, is how is that going to be handled?
Yes.
So this bill actually doesn't affect the reinstatement piece.
This is only the compensation piece.
And we clarified about reinstatement as far as the, if I was in office and I had a remainder
or four months in my office or whatever,
and I didn't run for re-election.
Someone else has now gotten that seat,
and the charges took a year to adjudicate,
and I was found innocent,
and I would get back pay for those remaining four months
that I was gonna have been in office.
So it's not putting someone actually,
it's not reinstatement from a standpoint
of them back into office as far as this legislation
is concerned, this is reinstatement
from I would have served this amount of time,
I get back pay for that.
Does it put someone back into office though?
And this is strictly for payment, compensation is done.
That's correct, strictly for compensation.
You have no further, you do have another question.
Do you yield?
Oh, you have one more, yes sir.
So you recognize this representative Bruce
up in the gallery to your right.
From the gentleman yield.
I will.
Just want clarification, this person is going to be punished
before they've been convicted of anything.
Is that what I'm hearing?
Well, it's not punished.
They're suspended.
They're no longer in the office.
And so a committee has got together
recommends to the governor that this person
can't do their fulfill their duties
because of the felony indictment that they have.
The governor has then chosen, which is a remain,
the governor has then chosen to remove this person
from office to spend them from office.
And I think the reality is most of the time the person self suspends themselves because
they don't want that.
And so they don't get paid during that time period that they're not able to serve.
If they get reinstated from a standpoint, the things gets adjudicated, they can get their
back pay.
But I don't think it's a punishment.
I think it's just a reality of where we are when it's happening.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time.
I hope you guys will support this measure and I yield the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to
the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
Report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass.
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
If all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on
the passage of Senate Bill 337.
The eyes are 149, the nays are four.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 332.
Senate Bill 332 by Senator Albers, the 56th, Dugan the 30th, Miller the 49th,
Grapatric, the 32nd, and others being titled an act to amend chapter 1 and
title 10 of the fiscal to Georgia and it ended relating to selling and other trade practices.
to provide for certain disclosures by third party high volume sellers of consumer products.
This bill I'm referring to Committee on Judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Houston Gaines to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Please to present Senate Bill 332 this afternoon in this state and across the country.
You've seen an issue with Organized Retail Crime, and this measure is designed to try
to address that last year we had a measure in the General Assembly that did really important
work to make Organized Retail theft felony crime in this state.
This measure adds to that by making sure that our online marketplaces, a lot of times
what will happen is, is Organized Retail Criminals will go in and steal a bunch of unused
and new material from our retailers, and then they'll go and sell it online.
So what this measure does, it's a simple, good, pro-consumer measure that ensures that
our online marketplaces are collecting information from the third-party reseller.
So if you go on Amazon, sometimes you're buying your product from Amazon, but sometimes
you're dealing with a third-party reseller.
And what this bill does is it ensures that those that Amazon and other marketplaces are
collecting information from those resellers, those third-party resellers, additionally
for high volume resellers that requires that they also disclose certain
information to consumers like an address and a way to get in contact with them
if there's an issue with with with the purchase. Mr. Speaker that's what the
measure does be happy to answer any questions if there are any. Do you yield
for questions? I will. Chair recognizes representative mom to hand to your
ride for a question. Does gentleman yield? I will. Isn't it true that this would
only capture the sale of new and unused goods.
And this would not capture those craft, you know,
creators on Etsy and other websites like that.
It would only be new and unused goods.
That's correct.
Thank you.
Do you further you?
I'll yield for one more, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Rebecca Mitchell
to your...
Fagley, right?
Oh, up to the gallery, yeah.
Thank you, Ellen.
Hi.
My question is actually follow up on the previous.
Etsy sellers are often making new and unused products.
And I know last year when we had this bill,
we got a tremendous amount of feedback from folks
because 200 of a small item can be made by someone who's
working in their own home, supporting their home income.
Those products are often new and unused.
Will folks who are making small volume products
to support a family, have to reveal their own home addresses.
So one on the home addresses, no.
If you only have a home address,
there is language in the build to address that.
That you would provide the city
and there would need to be some contact information.
Also, you wouldn't have to provide your home phone number,
for example, with an email address
and there's language in the build
that does address that concern.
If it is new and unused, it would apply.
But they do have to sell a certain amount.
It has to be a high volume reseller.
So I do feel like we've captured that issue so that you're not having to give your home address and those sort of things.
Thank you for the question. And Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for the body's favourable consideration on Senate Bill 332.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill or vote aye?
Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
is
a
being fair, if we're going to complain about increasing penalties and sentences on the
one hand, it's important to applaud when the majority does something that's a common
sense administrative response to crime that can limit the amount of crimes that exist
without unduly expanding our criminal justice system.
Is that not true, Mr. Speaker?
I'm so not used to hearing you say nice things about the majority that I'm having to let it absorb
What purpose does representative gravely rise
Problem that you're inquiry state your inquiry. It's not true that that message was paid for and approved by McCorn for Senate
There have been a whole lot of those that have been, have all members voted, have all members
voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of Senate Bill 332, the
eyes are 155. The nays are four. This bill having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed. I'm going to ask all members to take your seats. All members
take your seats. Chair recognizes
Representative Wolenski for a special
order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello
representatives. How did I end up here?
It was always funny to me when I was
running for office. I had a whole
group of don't any high schoolers ask me, you know, were you in young Democrats, you
know, what did you grow up doing? And I didn't even think about it till about 2010 or
11, where I was invited down here by GTLA for lawyers of the day. So I don't know, I ended
up here. But the last seven years have truly guided me to be here. 2015, 2016, I was
at an anti-definition league, a jurisprudence lunch. And I'll never forget, I was waiting
for my car and I looked to my left and there was Governor Barnes and I said I may run one day.
And then I'll never forget that the next year exact same location exact same spot waiting for my car
I looked to my left and Governor Barnes was there again and that's crazy and I said Governor Barnes
I'm actually thinking of running he said well come have lunch with me and I've had lunch with him
several times a year and he for the since then and I've had such an
opportunity by being in this house to meet with some the most brilliant minds
and amazing people and after I met with Governor Barnes one thing that
Governor Barnes said that I always thought was pretty funny he says attorneys
in general are crazy plane of attorneys who do injury roll for death work like
us are crazy here even crazier but then to be a state representative on top
top, you are the craziest. I don't think he was talking about me, but maybe.
But after Governor Barnes, and I decided to run, what was even more amazing is a young
man at Dunwoody High School, he had just started the Dunwoody High School young Democrats
in the club. And he introduced me to all of them. And when we ran for office as a group,
we knocked on 53,000 doors, the same 13,000 doors, about four times. And it was that group
students and all of the people in the 2018 election who knocked on doors during that time
who helped me change that seat, went from Republican to Democrat and that year in 2018,
14 of us flipped seats and it's amazing honor to be a part of that class.
So I definitely want to thank all of the people who knocked on doors who supported me financially
that year I raised, we raised $262,000, knocked on 53,000 doors, and it was a lot of work.
I started working in February, call time, 10 hours a week, and then to knock on doors.
And that's something I'll really miss about the State's House is all the relationships
form coming here every day and seeing y'all and just having fun conversations, horrible
conversations, funny conversations, and that's the part that keeps us coming back.
One of the first notes I wrote when I was going to give this speech was that Sharon
Men, Mary Margaret Oliver, didn't talk to me for the first year I was here.
I may not be true, but since then, we have become amazing friends.
She is incredibly brilliant, wise, we love playing golf together and it's been an honor
to be here with you and learn from you.
I knew, second I'll say, Speaker Raustin, Speaker.
It's been an amazing honor.
If you've never heard Speaker tell a joke,
he is a very funny man and he's a great man.
And the thing that's always I've noticed
is he's the speaker of the house and I understand he is
elected by one party and you never know
that may change at some point.
But the truth is that the speaker does represent all
and I'm very grateful for his service
and any speaker that comes.
Well, I knew I was also very lucky in my first term
at the Capitol when my mentor was representative Al Williams.
He was put to be my mentor.
He's not here right now.
One of the reasons I'm leaving, no, I'm just kidding.
No, but as y'all know, I'd love to spend more time with him
than I did, but you don't have to spend time
from Rev. Owl Williams to learn too much
because you hear about it on the house floor.
He's an expressive shot.
He's a boost of serotonin.
When I'm getting down, you hear him speak
and you feel better.
And every time I had a conversation with him,
it's such an amazing thing.
Dean Smirrey, it's been an honor to serve with you.
I've learned so much from you.
Learned how to be a great Democrat,
how to work with both sides.
I loved telling you I was going to say something
and you would say, don't say that.
and I wouldn't, but it's been a true honor
and having your friendship has been amazing.
I wanna thank Spiro for all of his hard work, Betsy.
I've made, well first of all, Spiro,
I never know what he means
because he's incredibly sarcastic towards me,
but he has been amazing help and works incredibly hard
and he's one of the hardest working people
without the capital.
Betsy, I've noticed this year that whenever the speaker's
up there, if y'all notice, I don't know if y'all notice,
but she does an amazing job,
but she is the captain of the ship.
She is leading, and it's amazing that,
even when I texted her sometimes at 10.30
to be like, hey, morning order, she's like,
no, that's tomorrow in the morning,
but you always responded and you do an amazing job.
She's laughing, because yes, that happens.
Chairman Allen Powell, still, oh, he's here.
All right, two in one day, but Chairman Powell,
So I got to serve on regulated industries this year and I would spend time sitting in
his office and I would learn so much and, you know, about life, nobody at home is going
to know why y'all are laughing.
But Dean Smirrey, you asked him a question and there's a couple of sentence answer and
Those couple words are actually paragraphs
when you think about it and go back and listen.
Chairman Allen Powell is amazing with speaking,
amazing with words.
And I learned so much about so many things
that go on in Georgia.
And I just wanted to thank him
for letting me be on regulated industries.
And it's been amazing.
My first served here was leader Tramble.
And that was an amazing experience.
We have leader Beverly.
And after this term looking at leadership
and seeing how much work is, I want to thank you all.
I can't imagine why y'all do that on top of everything else.
It's just amazing, which I'll do.
I want to thank the Cab Delegation Chairman Carla
Drenner.
That's once again, amazing job, and it's
been a joy of becoming your friend.
If you all want to learn politics, move to Cab
and be in the Cab Delegation in 2018.
I think it's the only time in Georgia history
that it was a head lot or in the newspaper
where somebody called me representative chicken shoot.
And that was my nickname for a while.
That was impressive stuff.
But the cab delegation was amazing lesson on politics,
amazing lesson on learning about people,
how to work with people, agree with people.
And so I wrote down leadership isn't easy.
And I see, I hope the power of love, the power to look out for people will overcome the love of power.
And when I've been grateful for this opportunity and I've been able to work with both sides.
And you know, I've learned I don't have to give up my values to work together.
You don't have to give up values to be kind.
You don't have to give up values to be respectful.
Last week, there was one guy who comes down there a lot for one
organization who isn't happy with Israel.
But he was waiting to speak at one of the committee hearings.
And I go, what bill?
And I said, I'm against that bill, too.
And we both literally jumped high five to go, yes!
And everybody turns it all away and goes, what's going on?
But it just showed that somebody who's been against what I've
looked at for three years, that moment we were together.
And it was such a cool moment we were so excited.
And I mean, just, that's what it's about.
I say, you know, you have to know your enemy,
but what I learned here in the capital,
once you really get to know somebody,
even when their views are painful, frustrating,
or maybe just annoying, they are not your enemy.
And that's the amazing thing down here.
And I don't know if I learned that as an attorney,
you know, as an attorney, we go to deposition,
we go to trial, and you fight,
but then afterwards you'll go have lunch or have a drink,
and you're able to do that.
I'm getting through it, we're moving pretty fast.
And so I wrote down here is just one thing I hope is everybody here will spend more time
getting to know each other, your families, your hobbies because I've gotten to know a lot
of y'all and that's when good legislation happens is because y'all are working together
on things that are really important about families and all of that.
To my dinner crew, y'all know who you are, it's been a pleasure learning from all of
all, a lot of y'all are my mentors and I really appreciate that. I had Circle here. Age is great,
it's just inconvenient. I don't know, that was in there. I want to thank the photographers Ben
and Katie. Smugmug will be smaller now that I'm gone, so that's cool. Let's see. And so one of the
biggest things that I think has changed is when I first came down here in 2011-12 is that it was
always said Georgia legislature is different than the federal government. It's
different that we work together we get things done and you know we're seeing a
little change maybe it's due to the power whenever but that's changing slightly
and just my hope as we go is that everybody starts working together and that
doesn't change that the parties don't come on the house floor more separate.
There's a song that said there's a battle line being drawn and nobody's right
if everybody's wrong.
And my view has always been that, you know, here,
we need to do legislation that does health care,
education, transportation, health small businesses,
help the elderly, help the sick, help the needy
and children, and I hope that continues,
and I hope politics doesn't get in the way.
And I became state rep after getting involved
with GTLA, and then being involved
with the Anti-Defamation League, their hate crimes bill.
And through what I learned, the Anti-Defamation League,
mainly the rise of anti-Semitism,
I wanted to run for my children
to make a difference for my children.
And a mentor of mine at attorney say,
when you have children, you know,
you're their parents for 18 years.
And I came down here for them,
and now I need to be there for them.
I need to be with them and teach them
all of the lessons I have learned.
And decisions are really easy
when you choose what's best for your children.
And I wrote here, what I've learned also is you can't be mad at legislation.
You can be mad at legislation, but I've learned it's sometimes hard for me mad at the person carrying the bill.
Now don't get me wrong, there are a few done here that make that easy.
But what I mean is I know them as a person.
And while their view on one or more issues is different, I can't be mad at them because I know they're here for the same reason.
I'm here, I believe the majority of us are all here for the same reason and I've seen
that and I've learned that no matter where you're from or what you're doing, you're here
for your family, for your children, for your friends, what you believe is right, to make
lives better.
And how can you be mad at a person who has the same motivations as you?
I made a note here based on some things this year, if you read the books that everyone
is reading, you can only think what everybody else is thinking.
So, you know, as a state, I hope we let people learn and learn different things so people
can learn to be different.
Your beliefs don't make you a better person, how you treat others who are different than
you does.
I wrote that.
So I'm almost done.
So anyways, I'm going to miss all my friends here.
I'm going to miss the Apple Fritters in the anti-room.
I won't gain 20 pounds next year, which will be good.
I wanna thank GTLA who are always fighting
for the seven of the rights of trial
and keep a good trial system.
And it's amazing, they're supportive of me.
And we only have 25 attorneys about in the state house
so hopefully we'll pick up some more, that's vital.
Think two things I'll miss is when you ask
Representative Williams, how's your day going?
He'll say, best day of my life.
If you have Chairman Powell, how's your day going?
How are you doing?
He'll say, better than I deserve.
I love both of those.
I want to thank Rabbi Heller, Rabbi Sarnovitz,
Rabbi Zimmerman, Rabbi Spike for all that supported me
to all the rabbis.
I am definitely just a turtle on the ledge.
And last couple of things is,
this has been an amazing experience for me.
It's, yeah, the attorney and politician
saying they're almost done, right?
Nah.
But I book ended my time.
It's been an amazing experience.
My first term down here session,
I got to vote on the hate crimes bill.
And we passed the anti-BDS bill.
This year, we have an anti-Semitism bill
going through our really hope.
And with last week, the formation of the Georgia Israel caucus,
that was a great book, and I hope you all will join.
In the four years I've been here.
I feel like I've aged 20.
It's been rewarding, difficult, fun, frustrating,
happy, exciting, miserable, and some of the most
thrilling years of my life.
But that's what it's all about.
You can't have the good without the bad, ups and downs.
And I commend all of y'all who serve
and have those extremes with me and we'll continue those.
And during session, it could happen
20 different times, 20 different ways.
I am grateful for all of you, for your service,
for your willing to sacrifice and deal
with all of those up and downs.
And thank you all for all you've done for me,
with me and for the state, and I yield the well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
