TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon, if I can have everyone's attention, we're going to go ahead and start the income
tax subcommittee, the ways and means committee. We've got several measures before us today.
And the first one we're going to hear today is going to be.
No, we're going to hear House Bill 1070 for Chairman Hagen.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you committee.
I'm sure you remember the first hearing last week, House Bill 1070, is regarding the
Georgia Shortline Railroad Track Maintenance Tax Credit, which was enacted back in 2018
at the recommendation of the Royal Development Council to support our shortlines.
bill extends the date's five years and it would increase the credit cat per
track mile from $3,500 to $5,000 and that is what the bill does and this is the
second here and we have any questions from the members of the community got
move do pass in a second any further discussion here in none all the
favorite favorite secret pop I see and I motion carries congratulations thank
you was that intimidating enough chairman thank you okay next will be
chairman Stevens bill house bill 519 can I do it from here okay thank you
Mr. Chair.
Members of the committee, this is a second hearing on this bill.
This is a work opportunity tax credit for these employers that will take a chance on these
employees that have gotten into trouble over a period of time, or maybe veterans, if you
will, that are physical or mental problems or impairments.
And it's an opportunity for them to extend a hand to get these folks off welfare and get
back into productive citizens. This might even be folks that have had a felony. So the
chances of them getting a job is slim and none so they wind up on our welfare payrolls.
It is a state tax credit of $500 and $10 million in that is the bill.
Well, again, this has been for the subcommittee one time, this is second hearing, is there
anyone from the audience who will speak for against the bill?
Is there any questions from members?
Representative Buckner.
No, the limit is the $500 cap per employee.
Any further questions?
Here, none.
What's the will of the committee?
A motion.
Second by Representative Prince.
All in favor say to him.
How about saying aye?
Opposed, same sign.
Here's unanimously.
Congratulations, Chairman.
Chairman Hilton, House Bill 376, this will be the first hearing of this measure.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I bring to you House Bill 376, this bill increases
the cap.
Give me the LC number on that one since this first year.
Yes, sir.
LC 501202S.
Thank you.
This historic tax re-abilitation, we've
seen it in a lot of our communities,
helps with redevelopment of some historic properties
and revitalizes a lot of downtown areas.
This program has been highly successful.
The cap has already been met on a program that
is set to expire in 2029, hence the need to come back
and raise the cap.
I know I've been working Mr. Chairman with you
and members of the committee to make some additional changes
and we'll probably have those in the following meeting,
but I've got some folks here to speak to the bill.
That's okay.
Hearing, do we have any questions from members of the committee?
Well now, if not, okay.
Mr. Chairman, the beauty of this bill
is that all of the expense and all the liability
is on the person doing the development, not on the state.
So when the state provides that tax,
it's after it's all been spent,
and the good, there's been,
I think it used to be almost $4 for one ratio
for the state of Georgia, so it's a really good program.
Let's help the rear of the line of structures
across the state.
And I understand we have two speakers.
The bill being set in, if you can come forward, please.
Just for the record and the microphone you just share with us who you are and who you
represent.
Good afternoon.
My name is Ben Sutton.
I'm the Senior Director of Preservation for the Georgia Trust.
We are the statewide nonprofit supporting historic preservation.
This is a critical tool for communities around the state.
We really appreciate this committee taking it under consideration because it's
vital to the work that we do. Thank you. Thank you. Do they have any
rumors? Have a question for the gentleman? Do I have the
representative prayers? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but not so much, I guess, for the
gentleman, but maybe kind of the accent right. Well, let me recognize, if you
don't have the general, it's not quite a gentleman. I'm sorry. Hold on, I'll
recognize it just for a minute. Mr. Sutton, can you just educate the
committee about how many years this start renovation tax credit program has been
slated Georgia.
State of Georgia has had a state credit since 2002 and do you have any and I have not asked
for this so I forgive this for not please forgive me if I'm not asking up front but do you
know how many structures and or how much money is gone into start renovation efforts
over the 24 years now?
I don't have numbers for the total.
I can tell you in the last five years,
this incentive has spurred over $800 million
of private investment across the state.
Well, that's the kind of number I was looking for.
So is it not true that it's been very impactful
for the communities across the world?
It has had a tremendous impact
and is a catalyst for redevelopment in every state,
in every corner of the state.
Well, thank you for coming and sharing those thoughts
with the community today.
Next, I will recognize Representative Anissa Jones.
Chairman, members of the Ways and Means Committee, subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity
to speak today in support of Georgia House Bill 376 and the continued investment in
in Georgia's historic tax credit.
Again, my name is Representative Anisa Jones
of House District 143, and I stand before you,
not only as a legislator, but as a direct recipient
of this program through the revitalization
of the 419 Cherry Street Project in Macon, Georgia.
Historic credits are not simply incentives.
There are catalysts for economic development,
small business growth, and community pride.
In cities like Macon, where history lives
in every brick and storefront,
these credits make the difference between vacancy
and vitality.
The restoration, excuse me, a 419 Cherry Street
has brought new energy to our downtown corridor.
We created jobs, it attracted visitors, it supports surrounding businesses, and it preserved
a piece of Georgia's architectural heritage for the next generation.
For many families like mine, legacy is not just about what we leave behind financially,
but what we build that endures.
revitalizing historic projects and properties,
strengthens neighborhoods,
encourages entrepreneurship and create space
where families can gather, work, dream,
and have an impact on their community.
Georgia House Bill 376 ensures that projects like mine
and countless others across our great state
remain viable investments that honor our past
while driving future growth.
The return on investment is visible,
increased property values, expanded tax basis,
and renewed confidence in areas that once felt overlooked.
These are not theoretical benefits.
They are measurable outcomes that I have witnessed firsthand
in making Georgia.
I respectfully urge this committee
to continue supporting policies that recognize preservation
as progress by strengthening the historic tax credit.
You empower local leaders, small business owners,
and families to transform aging structures
into engines of economic development and community legacy.
Thank you for your leadership and your commitment
to building a stronger Georgia, one historic cornerstone
at a time.
Thank you, Representative.
Well said.
Thank you for your investment and enthusiasm for the communities of Georgia.
Is anyone else from the audience like to make any comments on this particular measure?
Again, this was first hearing only, so thank you, I'm sorry, Chairman Newton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative, I wanted to just echo what you said about the revitalization.
I grew up in Macon, used to work down there a long time ago.
But I also was privileged to go back, I think, on the 300 block, just about a block away to a waiting reception this December, and the transformation there has been incredible.
Keeping the historic sides, but updating the inside.
You know where the Rookery is is a great place.
I just wanted to echo that.
This is making a difference in towns all across Georgia.
Certainly I've seen it in my own Augusta area.
I want to thank the sponsor for the bill.
Thank you Chairman Newton
Chairman Prince
Thank you chairman and
I support this 100 percent. I mean, it's done a lot of things as you mentioned in making but also in the Augusta area and
Just with how much participation we've had in here. I was talking to the author here about line 29
Maybe we do raising that rate back to instead of 25 going back up to I mean instead of 20 going back to 25
And really because of the cost of actually doing this type of renovation, I mean with the labor costs as well as the
The products that we need to
Or as wood and everything else going up
We want to keep this thing going and so hopefully you can look at that prior to
the next reading and
Something to consider. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Chairman Prince. You know, this is first hearing only so
So anybody has any further questions?
They think I'll have later if you just get with the
author of the bill and next where your concerns are
suggested, let us know.
So next we have House Bill 1159 from
for leave a gamble.
Well, good afternoon, Chairman,
members of the committee is good to be with you all today
and have the opportunity to present to you
the Farmer's Bridge Assistance Program Tax Detection,
which is a part of the governor's legislative package.
On December 8th, 2025, President Trump and the United States Department of Agriculture
announced $12 billion in one-time bridge payments to American farmers in response to temporary
trade market disruptions and increased production costs that are still impacting farmers following
four years of policies that resulted in record high input prices and zero new trade deals.
These federal bridge payments are intended in part
to aid farmers until investments
from the One Big Beautiful Bill act,
reach eligible farmers on October the 1st, 2026 this year.
Some disruptions, farmers are facing include reference
prices which are set to increase
between 10 to 21% for major covered commodities
such as soybeans, corns, corn and wheat.
of the $12 billion provided, up to $11 billion will be used
for the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program,
which provides broad relief to the United States
row crop farmers.
This legislation that you have in front of you House Bill 1159
would provide farmers with a state income tax deduction
equal to any amount of payments received as income
through the FBA program.
This is similar to last year's Hurricane Helene Relief Package Senate Bill 203, which
exempted federal disaster relief payments from state income tax.
This legislation ensures that farmers receive the full amount of these funds and can use
them for their intended purposes.
You know, I know there's probably some questions in here about the federal part of the bigger
bill that is affecting this, and I can't comment on federal trade policy, but what I can tell
you is that our governor is committed to lowering taxes for Georgians, and in this instance,
it is the Georgians that make sure we have food on our table every night. So I have Calvin
Sorby with me who is the governor's policy advisor in this space, and I'm happy to answer
any questions that you might have, but that in a nutshell is what we're trying to do here
with this legislation well thank you for later I will appreciate the governor's
offices efforts on this measure do we have any questions from members of the
committee here and that's first first hearing and a good measure look forward to
hearing it again thank you thank you
I believe that was our last measure before the income tax subcommittee so the income tax subcommittee stands adjourned.
