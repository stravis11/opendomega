TRANSCRIPT
----------
of convening, having arrived, all members of the House will please report to the floor
and take your seats.
All members will report to the floor of the House.
All members, the clerk will ring the bell.
All right, we're about to have the morning roll call or the afternoon roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
I'm authorizing the clerk to vote the machine
of representative Duke's who is up here at the podium.
Have all members voted?
Did we not hear the bell up there?
Have all members now voted?
I'm almost afraid to ask again, but let's try it.
have all members now voted. Who has not voted?
Representative Sains is voting president who else any others all right
Mr. Clerk let's lock the machines
The doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
We'll get after them.
Before we start our business, I want them.
The majority leader may talk about this later.
I don't know if y'all were aware, but we're in the middle of a pandemic.
And we sent out before we got here yesterday, last week, and I think even the week before,
multiple emails, advising of two things.
One that members were required to be tested every Monday and Thursday, and that testing
would be available here in the capital, as it was yesterday.
Imagine how I felt when I came in today and found out that yesterday, 74, I want to repeat
that, 74 members of this body did not get tested, that were present in the building.
And that's a bipartisan camp, by the way.
So you know, we're doing everything we possibly can to keep you safe, but it takes a little
bit of initiative on your part in following the rules because if you don't want to keep
yourself safe, I'd like for you to keep your neighbor safe and me safe and those around
you safe. So with that I hope you have a very calming message, Bishop. We will now begin
our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the gentleman from
the 154th House District Representative Winford Dukes,
Representative Dukes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
I want you to know really just how glad I am to see each
and every one of you.
Because doing these turbulent times,
I have truly been praying for you and your families
as I'm sure many of you have been praying for mine
as we all have been praying for Georgia
and these United States of America.
As many of you know, all been, it was the epicenter
for the pandemic here in the state of Georgia.
And it was widely reported
that the virus actually started
in two of our churches doing a funeral here in Albany.
They didn't tell you that we also had thousands
of people to come and run an American coming from all
over the world.
But one of those ministers succumbed to the virus
And one of them didn't, this morning we have with you want the minister that did not.
He is married to Felicia.
They have six kids.
He attended the theological training at Moore House.
He's a master Mason.
He has received awards throughout Florida and Georgia.
He is the founder and the senior pastor at the Gacinemy Worship International in Albany.
A church he started with only nine members and now they have over 1500.
On behalf of Chairman Green and Representative Camilla Hopkins, I ask that you receive
this anointed man of God, a mighty warrior, bishop,
with the Frederick Williams of Albany.
Good afternoon.
To the speaker.
To the House of Representatives and to all of you.
Thank you.
Representative Duke for that intro.
I want to say that it is an honor to be here, to stand here, and don't take it likely.
As representative Duke had said, one week we were walking in Normandy and without any
warning our lives were changed.
Our church was in the center of this pandemic, and we were forced to make rapid change.
At one minute and two days later, 40 of us from the church were sick, 20 was on ventilators,
10 died within two weeks.
I, my wife, for my children and their husbands,
were all stricken with COVID-19
and which some of my children are principals and vice-principients.
We were at a place of total maze,
but I want to share with you today
that in all being the Georgia,
There are some courageous people that help us get through this most difficult time.
The word I would share with you today is found in Proverbs 4 and verse 7.
It speaks to the very heart and soul as to how to survive and to adjust to swift transitions
for life is fear which swift transitions.
Before you opt out in the future,
before you give up, before you throw in the towel,
it suggests in our daily devotion to get wisdom.
I wanna drop that today to tell you wisdom
is the beginning of knowledge and understanding.
And verse seven says, a new living version,
Getting wisdom is the wisest thing that you can ever do.
Getting an understanding as to what is happening,
as to your responsibilities, as to your heart.
And what others expect of you proves
to make you a valuable person.
In the beginning of my life,
my mother, who is not 88 years old,
spoke a word of wisdom to me.
She said, son, the people are dependent on you.
Don't let them down.
I wanted to rebuttal and say, mama,
they should depend on God and not me.
But I realized what she was saying.
How do I deal with that?
And how do I become the best that she wanted for me?
It's through study and wisdom.
Wisdom is powerful.
And I would say it has caused us an all-bending to overcome great challenges after losing
10 people within a week or two your faith and everything about you is shaken, everything
that you once knew is shaken, but God.
It gave me wisdom enough to first pride, to secondly understand what is going on, and
to be a good steward over that which I had charged.
Before I pray now, I want to leave with you this morning,
proverbs four, seven, be wise.
In this 2021 year, be wise and use that wisdom
to better the lives and the surroundings of those around you.
I want to give you, I want to put the hex on you,
mama put on me, the people are depending on you.
Don't let them down. Don't let them down. Shall we stand for prayer?
Father God, we come today thanking you for our House of Representatives
of the State of Georgia. We thank you for the opportunity to stand and assure you your men
in your women that as they stand and plan that you are with them. Father, we
pray for our nation, our leaders, and of course our government. That you would
restore us, bridges above our current situations. United us for a common
good, a mankind. We pray for this house of rep, safety and unselfish labor of love. We
thank you now in Jesus' name. Amen.
Amen.
Let us pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
of which it stands,
one nation, under God,
in the living, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
Okay?
Doorkeepers, may I unlock the doors?

we're going on now to morning orders. Morning orders. If you have signed up for a
morning order please make your way to the front of the chamber. The chair would
ask you to limit your remarks to not more than two minutes and the chair
recognizes Chairman Bill Workhizer for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Speaker, yesterday when you were being nominated, it spoke about your love of history
and wanted to share something that took a lot of work to find out.
This afternoon, like every session you end, you will call on the majority later to make
a motion to adjourn us and then you'll call for the question and it is an overwhelming
no.
You always ignore that and adjourn us and so I found out why, way back in the 1850s, a couple
legislators had a bill that made it out of committee, made it out of rules, but yet
the speaker would not ever call the bill.
So Simon Die came and as the clock ticked, their bill never got called, so when the speaker
asked for that motion, everyone said yes and said for those two legislators who screamed
no.
And so as they came back the next year, became a tradition for a different reason than just
to be funny, it's a statement that we are here to do the people's work, don't send us
home.
And so just keep that in mind as we, like most traditions, now the Senate does it, most
great traditions in the state begin in the house.
just remember that when the speaker asked for us to adjourn that we are here to work
and we're always ready to work. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm envious that you found that out before I did, Mr. Chairman. That's a great story.
Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, today I come to you of tragic news
that the Gwinnett County Public School System
and the Rock Springs Elementary School families
have lost a beloved member of their community.
Mod Jones, who was a paraprofessional at Rock Springs Elementary,
sadly lost her life due to COVID-19 on January 4th
after being hospitalized on December 16th.
This is after she had just completed her paperwork
to retire on December 18th due to concerns
about working in the building
under threat of contracting COVID-19.
As we take a brief moment of silence in her honor,
let us please remember the very real
and potentially ultimate sacrifice.
We unfairly ask of each person that enters a school building during this pandemic.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
...
The clerk...
...
Okay, we have some announcements, I want you to listen up, Chair recognizes Representative
Kimberly Alexander for an announcement.
She waves.
Chair recognizes the majority leader of the house
for an announcement.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker, good afternoon, y'all.
Let's some revisit our surveillance testing
just for a moment.
First thing I'll tell you, if you're still
having a concern or a problem getting into the portal,
certainly you can reach out to Georgia Tech,
but the minority leader and I stand ready to help anyone from either side of the aisle
to assist in that effort to make sure that we can be tested, everyone can be tested
on Thursday, Thursday morning from 7 until 11.
Now as we talked about this yesterday, this is something we've worked on on a bipartisan
manner to make sure we're trying to protect the health and safety of every member of this
body and every staff member. So we need your cooperation. We know there's some of you
that also there's some other circumstances where some folks may have tested in other locations
on Monday. But what we've agreed to and what we need to do to make sure we have an ongoing
record of our members is that we need to test here on Mondays with the Georgia Tech Surveillance
team on Mondays and Thursdays. Let's be clear on something else when we come back after
next week when we're all for appropriations hearings in the Martin Luther King holiday
holiday testing will be on Tuesday and if we're in it will be on Thursday of that week
Tuesday and Thursday of that week. So we need to test on those days. It's almost a
So a painless test, y'all, I can spit on a tube, a PCR test, so that works out as a proven
technology and we need to take advantage of it to protect each other.
So we encourage you, thank you Keith, and I was, need to make sure I say that.
Next week also the week that we're here for appropriations hearings, the ones that are
here or if you need to be tested, we will be testing again on Tuesday and Thursday of next week.
So the following two weeks we will be testing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Now you don't need to
drive in from South Georgia to North Georgia somewhere else next week to be tested on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. But you will need, as I'm also we discussed earlier, if you are not here next week to
to be tested by Georgia Tech, you will need to test before you come back. You will need
to test before you come back. If you participate virtually on the appropriations hearings
next week, as we're going to be encouraged to do, you need to test next week at a different
location. But if you're here in this building and you're participating on this floor,
you need to test on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as we've just discussed, or back we'll get
on the schedules of Mondays and Thuristies.
I see, I think we all get that, now we need to take advantage of that.
And I've touched on the two things, reach out to the leader or myself.
If you have a concern about anything with the portal, we'll be glad to assist with that
and help make sure you're ready for Thursday.
As the pastor said this morning, we need to depend on God and not ourselves, but we certainly
need to do our part.
And this is the part we can do to help in this pandemic and help be good stewards of our
neighbor's health and our own.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the will.
Do you yield for questions?
Yes, sir.
I yield for questions.
Chair recognizes in room 341, Representative Anderson for a question.
Well, maybe not.
He waves off.
Okay.
Chair recognizes representative Bruce to your right for a question.
For the gentleman you yield to my friend.
Thank you, sir.
of foreign clarification, when we were in session last go around, we took a vote on being
able to conduct our business remotely.
Whatever happened to that, you know, because we're here and we're telling everybody else
to stay home, we're telling everybody else in the state to stay home and not gather,
but we're gathering it.
So what happened with that legislation?
Well, we are taking all the safety precautions, the distance scene, the different gallery,
341, that is laid out as far as the protocol from the public health and from CDC.
We also will allow our committee meetings, we'll certainly follow the same rules, and
Certainly we adopted the rules for this session,
21, 21, 22 session, which are most of them are very similar.
But we think that the protocol we have in place
to additional safety surveillance
certainly ensures the safety of our members.
Well, and certainly, I think you're aware of this,
but certainly as far as this of us here
doing our businesses on the floor and passing legislation
this out, it's mandated by the Constitution
that we do it this way,
until there's some sort of change made in our Constitution.
I thought that's what we did during the last session
is that we allowed ourselves to be able to conduct
our business remotely.
I thought that's what that was.
And you're right about that.
We did that, but the Senate did not follow suit,
Representative Bruce.
Thank you.
So obviously, as you know, we can't take
in a lateral action here and have that effect
without the Senate following seat.
Thank you for the question.
You have one more question if you care to you.
I have one more, Miss Smith.
Chair recognizes representative Drenner
to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
I yield to the lady.
Thank you, Mr. Leader, for all of your efforts
surrounding keeping us safe.
Can you just, would you mind repeating the results section
of how those will be communicated?
I do not have the exact language in front of me,
but I can tell you what it will be.
The results come back to our HR director
and then those results are communicated out
from the HR director or from the speakers office.
If you're if you're a positive, if you're a negative result,
you will not going to call, but you'll be notified by 7 a.m.
The next morning will be the latest.
You'll be notified.
If you need to be notified, you have no further questions.
Thank you, Miss Speaker and members, we appreciate
everyone cooperating to keep each other safe
as we look forward to continuing this session
in our productive work.
Thank you, Miss Speaker, I yield the will.
Her recognizes Chairman England for an announcement.
Thank you, Miss Speaker. Good afternoon, everyone.
I know that we're everyone's anxious about next week in the budget hearings,
the joint budget hearings with our friends in the Senate.
Just to give you a little bit of a heads up, it's going to be a lot different
this year than what we've what we've done in the past.
We are going to have a virtual option for the members of the committee
to be able to log in through and into Zoom,
thanks to Betsy's help and the help of a lot of other folks.
But the committee members will be sending out an email
as soon as we know who all comprises the committees,
hopefully later this week, to the committee members
that will be an exclusive Zoom link
for you to be able to log in,
which will help you access the chat box
to be able to ask questions that way.
We're strongly encouraging everyone to do it virtual.
We have a very limited number of seats in 341
that we'll be using.
Several of our presenters will be virtual.
Some will be in person as well.
Chairman Tillery and myself and some of our staff
will be in there to kind of orchestrate things
and make sure everything flows as best as possible.
But again, we certainly ask everyone
if you would to do that virtually.
Don't mind if you come in, but just know
that if the doorkeeper tells you you can't,
it just means there's not an open seat at that particular time
when you're trying to come in.
So don't be offended, don't get angry at those folks.
They're just doing their job.
Those of you that are not on the committee
that want to watch the proceedings,
there will also be an email that goes out
explaining how to get on the live stream
to be able to watch the presentations
and hear the questions being asked by the committee members.
So just give us another day or so
until we get everything nailed down completely,
but I just want to give you a heads up
because several of you have asked me about that.
Thank you.
If I could have your attention, please,
before we finish today,
I became aware when we came in just a little bit ago
that one of our most beloved members here in this body
of representative, Patty Bentley,
who has had such a struggle with her husband,
as you know, for I guess a year and a half,
hour, two years, has even a newer and tougher challenge. She and I have talked about that.
I ask her if it would be with her approval if we as a body before we adjourned today, lifted
her and her family and her husband up in prayer. She would welcome that very much. I have
ask representative Mac Jackson to come to the well to lead us in prayer for
Patty and her husband. Thank you, the speaker. It would just by his please. Heavenly
Father, we come before you right now in the name of Jesus. We just ask you to
wrap your loving arms around, represented Patty Bentley, her family father,
Wrap your arms around them and comfort them, Lord God.
We call on you right now in the name of Jesus.
Father, we just thank you for your love, your mercy, and your grace right now.
And as Paul said in his words, your grace is sufficient.
So bestow your grace and your mercy upon the family of represented patty Bentley right now, Father.
Wipe the tears from the eyes, Lord, and comfort them and give them peace in this hour
in the name of Jesus Father, but you don't only help,
we know in this hour, and we call upon you right now
in Jesus' name, amen.
Amen.
I think that representative Bentley would have me ask
that you keep her and her husband and their family
in your prayers when we leave here today,
as you can't get in to see you.
Please join me in wishing a happy birthday to Chairman Jan Tancersley today. Happy birthday,
Chairman Tancers. And the chair recognizes the majority leader of the house for a motion.
I give a speaker.
Miss speaker, I moved at this house,
stand adjourned until 10 a.m.
Wednesday, January the 13th, 2021.
The majority leader has moved.
Keep in mind the education lesson
you had from Chairman Workhizer now.
On the majority leader has moved
that this house be adjourned until 10 a.m.
Wednesday, January 13th, 2021.
All those in favor of the motion will say aye.
Those opposed will say no.
The eyes clearly habit in this house will be adjourned
until Wednesday, January 13th at 10 o'clock a.m.
Thank you very much.
