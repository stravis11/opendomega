TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. My name is John Moe. I'm the senior
director for policy at the Urban League of Greater Atlanta. And on behalf of
our partners, the Georgia NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the ACLU of
Georgia, the League of Women Voters, leader Carolyn Hugley, leader Harold Jones, we welcome
you to this press conference to address Senate Bill 120 and its effects on the communities
we serve. At this time I'm going to bring to you our leader, the leader of the Democratic
party in the Senate Senator Minard Lear, Harold Jones.
Thank you.
Recently the Georgia Senate has taken up SB 120, which bans promoting, supporting or maintaining
any programs or activities that advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion.
According to the bill, post-secondary institutions
that violate its provisions would have state funds
or state administered federal funding withheld.
But it is actually bigger than that.
The salt on diversity is actually an assault
on American values.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion brings people together.
It basically brings us together to solve
America's and Georgia's problems.
The salt in SB 120 is a retreat from the American
and Georgia spirit of inclusion.
It's that a retreat from our shared values
of finding out what makes us better as a nation
and as a state.
This in assault is one that diverts our attention.
At this particular point in time,
we should be bringing people together
to solve such issues, such as health care,
housing, income inequality, and childcare issues.
But instead, we've passed bills like SB 120,
which tears us apart.
Because make no mistake, our nation in this state
can only solve these problems together.
And diversity, equity, inclusion brings us together,
all bringing us with unique perspectives,
but all having a singular focus
on how we can improve the lives of the people of America
and the people of this state.
That is why it is bigger than just losing state funding.
It actually is an assault on our American values
and Georgia values.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Leader.
Next, the honorable Nikki Merritt, who serves as a member
of the State Senate, who serves as chairperson
of the Georgia Legislative Caucus.
Senator Merritt?
Good afternoon, everyone.
and greetings, members of the press.
SB 120 is an legislative, it is a tone-deaf legislative tragedy.
And it is designed to tear us apart in the state of Georgia.
Despite overwhelming feedback against SB 120,
the authors and the committee members who push this legislation
through have continued to force this bill
through this system and abusing the legislative power
that they have been given.
It is an insult to the entire state of Georgia
and the diversity that we enjoy in this state and celebrate.
First of all, it's a complete rejection
of our state's legacy and what makes our state exceptional.
We are one of the most diverse states in the entire country
And our history is built upon a sense of pride
related to Georgia's core role
in the civil rights movement.
Secondly, the evidence shows that diversity programs work.
But they're not even enough.
As of 2022, Black faculty comprise of only 6%
and 3.6% of full professors at UGA and Georgia Tech.
Respectively, between UTA and Georgia Tech,
moreover, Black students only account for 6.4%
of the students enrolled at UGA,
and 8% of the students enrolled at Tech.
Black Georgians make up one-third of the overall state's
population.
Cutting back DEI programs that help recruit and retain
students and faculty will only make the disparity worse. Lastly, it reveals again how
unserious some legislators are about using our power to improve the lives of our
constituents in all Georgians. There is a massive amount of funding
state here, massive that many of our institutions rely on. It creates a legal
risk by weaponizing civil rights laws against the very people those laws were
designed to protect. This was threatened the vital pipeline programs for
educators and how again is this benefiting anyone? I keep seeing legislation
this this session that benefits no one. I'm calling on my federal fellow
senators to reject SB 120 and I'm asking members of the public and hear me
clearly. I need you to call these legislators that pass that pass through SB 120
ring their phones off the hook and if you need their numbers I'm gonna put them
on my website and you start calling them now call the lieutenant governor
Call the governor and tell them this is unacceptable and we want you to reject 120 and don't even bring it to the Senate floor
Good after nims
Thank you chair person and now former state representative Roger Bruce
I told everybody I wasn't coming back down here. Let's they pissed me off
off. And they pissed me off. Why do we need laws that deal with diversity and deals with
helping the descendants of slavery? Why do we need to support diversity? The main reason
is because slavery was real, it was not a myth.
People died, people were lynched.
All kinds of things happened in this country.
They caused people, there were descendants of slaves,
to not have an equal opportunity and equal chance
to be able to participate in democracy,
as they said, democracy was supposed to be.
We didn't do that.
The playing field is not level.
We're not in a situation where everybody starts
from the same point.
And when that doesn't happen, some people
have an advantage that others don't.
And admission to segregation and admission
to all of those things that went wrong is a starting point.
It gives us an opportunity to determine what has happened
bad in this country that we need to fix. I really want to call on those people
that are sponsoring this bill to tell us what's really bothering them. What's
really wrong because it can't be this because you can't be totally ignorant
toward this happening. There's something else that's on your mind. I think you
We need to bring it out so we can address what's really bothering you.
We can all stay any all day long and try to guess what that is.
I think we all know, but you need to come out and say it.
What's the real problem and what do you want to do about it?
I want to thank all of those that have come out today because a lot of people seem to
be afraid for whatever reason to speak out and speak up for things that are wrong.
in this city, in this country, and in this world for that matter.
I don't know what's on people's mind and make them fearful,
but I'm glad to see these people that came out,
because what is going on is wrong.
This bill should not even get to the Senate floor,
and I hope that if it does,
that you will stand up and do what's right and vote it down.
Thank you for allowing me to come and say something today.
Thank you, Representative Bruce.
Thank you, Representative Bruce.
At this time, ladies and gentlemen,
I have the high privilege and distinct honor
of presenting Nancy Flake Johnson,
President CEO of the Urban League of Greater Atlanta.
President Johnson.
Thank you.
I want to thank everyone who showed up to support
our firm and solid opposition to SB 120.
informed by history, the Urban Leaks understands the harm that SB 120 will bring to our public schools,
our public institutions and most importantly to our communities across this state.
This bill limits our constitutional rights to freedom of speech and equal access for all families
to the critical resources and needs that we all require to live a quality life.
But most importantly, diversity equity inclusion is actually one of the best strategies that our country has employed
to bring us together and achieve parity for all citizens in our country.
DEI supports women, minorities, people with disabilities,
the LGBTQ plus community, and we too are citizens of this state.
In fact, when all of those constituency groups combine, we make up more than half the population of our state.
So we are imploring our elected officials to listen to your constituents, to think through carefully the impact,
the trickle down but devastating impact that the passage of this bill will create.
We've already seen in the last 30 plus days the ripple effect of these policies,
people losing their jobs, institutions having to limit access to care,
There, students fearful that they will not receive their scholarship so they can complete
their education.
This bill is designed to support people, all people.
We know our history in this country.
This bill would even ban our ability to talk about race and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
The way civil society solves problems, it's through communication.
It's through the sharing of ideas and solutions.
And so we are prayerful that our elected officials will listen to their constituents.
We participated in the hearing last week on this bill, not one single solitary person
who testified was in favor of this bill, yet there were 30-40 diverse individuals present
all expressing our concerns.
And we have elected officials who don't listen to their constituents and serve them in an
authentic way.
We put our democracy and our society and our state at risk.
So thank you for being here.
Let's stand together.
And I'm going to reiterate the points that our elected officials who preceded me stated.
If our government does not hear from the people, they are in a position to put forth their
personal agendas.
So pick up the phone, make the calls, write the letters, send the emails.
We've got to have our voices heard.
The urgency is now.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, President Johnson, at this time, the honorable Carolyn Houdley, House
minority leader.
Good morning and thanks to everybody for being here.
You know the United States of America is not just a place on the map.
It's an idea.
It's a promise.
is a beacon of hope from our very founding people
from all over the world have come here seeking freedom
and opportunity.
Our statute of liberty says, give me your tired,
your poor, your huddle masses, your name to breathe free.
And President Reagan called America a shining city
on the hill because we welcome all who dare to live free,
who want to believe in American dream.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion
is a part of the American dream.
And that's because anything is possible if you work hard.
Our diversity is not our weakness, it is our strength,
it inspires innovation, it strengthens our economy
and it enriches our culture.
We are a nation of white and native, black and brown, young and old, men and women rich
and poor.
We are people all the same, all the same because we are Americans.
America is the greatest nation on earth, and I believe you think as I do, that we cannot
be great if we embrace hate and Senate Bill 120 is about embracing hate and I call on every
Georgian of Goodwill to call on our senators to reject this awful bill because it was one
said that this was a place that was too busy to hate.
Thank you.
Thank you, Alita.
And now Chase Petifert will bring remarks the student and president of the Georgia Tech
NAACP.
Chase?
Good morning.
My name is Chase Petifert and I serve as the president of the NAACP unit seated at Georgia
Tech.
I stand here before you today, not only as a student leader speaking on behalf of many
student leaders, not only as a Georgia resident speaking on behalf of many
Georgia residents, but as a person who is scared about the future of our
communities on my campus and on campuses around our state. I was asked to speak
about the impact of anti-DI policies on students at Georgia Tech, and the
truth is we are terrified. These policies do not create fairness, they only
deepen any quality. When I first considered attending Georgia Tech, I was told I
I might not find a place there,
but those fears were unfounded.
Georgia Tech welcomed me my peers
and because of this commitment
to fostering a campus where everyone belongs.
To watch this come under fire this week
has been the lowest point of my academic career.
These spaces, places, and conversations foster community,
not some unfair advantages or an ideology
that harms other groups.
We are watching our institutions
that have made great strides in the last 50 years,
regress in front of our eyes and it is heart-breaking.
As Senate Bill 120 currently stands,
there is no carve out for student organizations.
As entities registered through our institutions,
it is unclear how student organizations,
organizations that we have built
from the ground up will survive if this bill passes.
This bill is a direct attack on students from all angles.
Moreover, Senate Bill 120 isn't just about the present.
It's about Georgia's future.
This bill threatens and undermine Georgia Tech's legacy
as a leader in education and innovation.
It risk restricting the free exchange of ideas
and perspectives that are crucial
to the growth of our institution and our state.
If this bill passes, we will see that students leave Georgia
to pursue education in states that value inclusion
and belonging.
What kind of future does that create for Georgia?
Research has shown that diverse educational environments foster innovation,
collaboration, and better outcomes for all students.
These programs are essential to preparing our students to be leaders in a globalized world.
Cutting them off will only hinder our state's ability to compete in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.
I strongly believe that Senate Bill 120 will harm not only Georgia Tech students,
but all students in this state.
It will prevent us from living up to the ideals of fairness
and opportunity that Georgia has long stood for.
Therefore, I respectfully urge you to vote no
on Senate Bill 120.
Let us not allow the progress we've worked so hard
to achieve to be reversed.
Our students deserve better, and Georgia deserves better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Powerful.
Thank you, Chase.
And next, Rainy Reinhardt, a student.
Rainy, are you with us?
See you, Senator.
Hey, Rainy, please.
Hello.
My name is Rainy Reinhardt, and I'm an organizer
with the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition.
As well as a first-year student at Georgia Tech,
studying communication and biology.
Right now, in the two-hour gap
between my chemistry lecture and lab,
I should be catching up on homework and grabbing lunch.
Instead, I'm here standing in front of you
because I refuse to stay silent while our legislators
attack the programs that make Georgia's colleges
an accepting place of belonging.
To the legislators pushing this bill,
I ask you to think back to your first week of college.
Do you remember what it was like to be surrounded
by strangers, the nervous, surreal energy
when everyone made small talk of the drop of a hat?
You didn't find your people in that first week.
You may not have found them in your first year,
But when you did, how did it happen?
Was it through a club, a campus program?
You know that these spaces are crucial to student success.
So what happens when they're gone?
My first semester of tech was lonely.
I wondered if I'd ever find the friendships
a dream defining in college.
That changed when I found Georgia Tech's LGBTQ plus resource
center and the student-run Pride Alliance.
These spaces bring students of all genders
and sexualities together in community.
These spaces became my go-to between classes,
my relief after stressful exams.
They gave me community and belonging.
That's why last month I ran for Vice President of Operations
for Pride Alliance because I want to help every first-year
student feel the same sense of belonging that I found.
But I stand here today because I worry for students
across Georgia who may never get the chance to experience
that feeling.
SB 120 has already forced Georgia Tech to dissolve
crucial student support programs, including the LGBTQ Plus Resource Center, Black
Culture Innovation and Technology, Intercultural Student Programs, and the Women's Resource
Center.
This bill is part of a larger effort to whitewash our communities and our history to control
a political narrative, erasing Black, Brown, and LGBTQ Plus voices from our institutions
while propping up a world where only a few privileged people belong.
We know that throughout history, certain politicians have tried to divide us by race, gender,
background to hold power. They tell us the funding programs for black students, queer
students, and other marginalized communities is unfair while they rig the system to benefit
the wealthy few. We won't fall for it. I'm here to ask, on a campus full of people from
countless backgrounds and countries where students speak dozens of languages, how can
we thrive without programs that advocate for diversity? In a state, in a country that
has refused to provide its citizens with equal opportunities,
how can we thrive without programs that advocate for equity?
On a campus with over 50,000 students
in an intense academic culture that can be isolating
and overwhelming, how can we thrive without programs
that advocate for inclusion?
We can't.
The students of Georgia cannot thrive under SB 120.
I speak for students across the state
when I demand at the very least that our legislators carve
protections for student organizations within the language of SB 120. This would
align with executive orders limiting DI programs and public institutions.
Failing to carve out these protections would be a blatant violation of our
First Amendment rights. A few of my peers are here today including someone who
works for what was the LGBTQ bus resource center. Hundreds of tech students are
organized in the past week to fight SB 120. They're making calls. They're
showing up. The students of Georgia will not sit back and let our constitutional rights
be stripped away by the people that we elected to represent us. We are organizing, we
are speaking out, and we will not be silenced. Thank you.
Thank you, Rainey. Next, our Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia, Attorney,
Andrea Yom.
Thank you very much.
I want to ask everybody to listen to our students.
When I graduated as an honor student from an Atlanta public
school, I did not even consider the University of Georgia.
Because only a decade before, students
integrating this University of Georgia
had been yelled at and isolated and treated
like they did not belong.
My daughter was able to go to University of Georgia
with the kind of programs that are now being attacked
by this bill.
She was able to thrive in her NAACP chapter.
She was able to thrive in the student government association
where children's students from all backgrounds
all across Georgia came together and learned how to work
together and how to lead.
And so these are the things that are at stake.
I mean, there's really nothing I can say more than looking
at these young people to understand what is at stake.
We're not talking about admissions.
You know, there's no affirmative action in admissions
in public universities in Georgia.
We are talking about the students who have the test scores,
have the grades, who were excelled in their high school
programs, will they be able to thrive
in our demanding research settings like Georgia Tech
and University of Georgia and our other research institutions.
You know, our very selective institutions,
the students who qualify to go
to these highly selective schools,
will they have the services that they need
to thrive and do their best work
and fulfill the potential
that they have already demonstrated that they have.
And so that is what is at stake in this program
and this denial of the reality of our diversity.
And of course, I have to say that in Georgia
And in Metro Atlanta, we know diversity has been our strength.
But we are still behind.
There is a new, as they are considering this bill,
there is a report that says Metro Atlanta is dead last
in terms of economic mobility for our children.
So these are children who have beaten the odds.
We have kids who beat the odds.
But let's understand, we are leaving far too many children
behind and Charlotte, up the road, when they heard about this,
When they heard about this report a decade ago,
they got busy and did something about it.
We need to do something about moving our children
out of poverty into prosperity.
We are behind nationally in that endeavor,
and this bill will make it even more difficult
for our educational institutions,
which are the engines of opportunity
to address the specific needs of our diverse students
and help them thrive and become the prosperous adults
that we all need them to be,
because I don't know about you,
I need somebody paying into social security for me.
So we need our students to fulfill their fullest potential,
not just for them, but also for our entire community.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Young.
And now, Hamid Alavi,
Senior Policy Council for the NAACP, legal defense fund.
Hamidah?
Woo!
Woo!
Good morning.
Can you hear me?
OK.
OK.
Good morning.
My name is Hamidah Suat LaBee.
I serve as Senior Policy Council at the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund, the nation's oldest racial justice legal organization.
And as the organization that litigated Brown versus Board
of Education, we are here today to urge the Senate
to oppose the ongoing attack on diversity, equity,
and inclusion and vote no on Senate Bill 120.
Today we are proud to stand alongside these fierce advocates
fighting back against the onslaught of attacks
on racial justice and educational equity.
Senate Bill 120 is a dangerous effort
to politicize our public educational system
and it puts Georgia's educators and students last.
This legislation threatens to exacerbate
pre-existing racial inequality through its vague prohibitions,
lack of substantive or procedural guard rails
and penalties like we heard today
that could also strip schools of billions of dollars
in federal funding, resulting in substantial harm
to Georgia's public school students,
entire school districts, and across college campuses
across our state.
Much like we saw with the attacks on critical race theory,
this legislation broadly mischaracterizes
diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Anti-stable rights advocates have co-opted the term
to refer to anything related to race, gender,
or sexual orientation, while also distorting its goals
to wrongly suggest that they are discriminatory.
When in actuality, they are used to prevent
and remedy discrimination.
LDF is deeply concerned that this bill may lead
to the targeting of black students and educators
through the elimination of racially inclusive
instruction, programs, and services
that help us to overcome unfair barriers
and better integrate into non-diverse environments.
As highlighted today, we have already seen examples of this,
how ironic that in Georgia,
where we first integrated or desegregated,
rather our college campuses and universities,
only 64 years ago,
are we having a conversation
about how Black Georgians receive preferential treatment
or special benefits?
Denying the existence of the persisting vestiges
of the legal subjugation of Black people in our state
and across our country is what this bill does.
This is not just about acknowledging truthful history.
It is also about acknowledging how that history contributes
to existing disparities.
The proposed justification for this bill
belies the real life experiences
of black educators and students from Atlanta to Savannah
and all across the black belt.
Black professors and students remain grossly underrepresented
as highlighted in Senator Mayor's comments.
And prohibiting diversity equity and inclusion
will exacerbate those disparities.
We also know that black students attending
the least racially diverse schools
experience discrimination most frequently.
Our K-12 education system has similar concerning disparities,
and Georgia is one of the top 10 states in the country
with the highest rates of school segregation
for black students.
But here we are today trying to justify
why diversity, equity, and inclusion programs should exist.
As a product of Georgia's public school education system,
I know from personal experience what this looks and feels like.
How can we justify certain public school students having access to high quality, diverse
educators, robust and inclusive school curricula, computers and books that are not falling apart
and wrap around services while others within the same state and oftentimes within the same
district lack access to these same resources.
Today we should be gathering to talk about policies to close the racial achievement gap,
like improving funding for low income students,
culturally responsive approaches
to strengthening school climate,
and other ways that we should uphold our constitutional mandate
of equal protection in our public schools.
Indeed, the success of our multiracial democracy
relies upon pathways to academic and professional achievement
that are open to all.
This legislature must wield its authority
to effectuate laws designed to truly remedy
legacies of racial exclusion that persists today.
not erect new barriers to those very communities
harmed by racial discrimination,
by dismantling lawful efforts
that help schools comply with federal civil rights
and anti-discrimination laws.
Now is not the time, never is the time
for Georgia to take a step backwards.
Vote no on Senate Bill 120, call the governor,
call the lieutenant governor,
follow all the call-stay actions that we hear today.
Let's keep fighting.
Thank you.
Both no, both no, both no, both no, both no, both no, both no, both no, both no, both no.
Our last speaker and a powerful advocate on behalf of all people, my good friend attorney,
Christopher Bruce, Policy Director at the ACLU of Georgia.
Good morning.
Yeah, I'd love to hear that.
Good morning.
I'm Christopher Bruce, the Policy and Advocacy Director
of the ACLU of Georgia in organization for over 70 years
that has protected Georgia's constitutional rights
community, in the courts, and especially in the classroom.
At its core, Senate Bill 120 is an attack on the values that
make our schools and universities places of learning, growth,
and opportunity.
This bill prohibits people from walking in front of the speakers
podium, as well as prohibiting educational institutions
from advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion,
but tellingly, it all allows opposition
to these very same principles.
This viewpoint, discrimination, and its direct violation
of First Amendment rights of students and educators alike.
Educators have the right to express diverse viewpoints
in the classroom.
And students have the right to receive information free
from government interference.
Senate Bill 120 was stripped those rights away.
By silencing discussions on diversity equity and inclusion,
this bill seeks to erase critical parts of our history.
Limits students' ability to engage
with realities of the world around them.
This censorship is seen.
It is plain and sensual.
It is plain.
It is seen.
It is a violation of your rights.
Senate Bill 120 is also a blatant attack on student organizations.
Under this bill, student groups that would promote diversity and inclusion could be shut down
or even worse defunded.
While groups opposing those values would be allowed to remain, this is a direct assault
on students rights to freedom of association, another fundamental constitutional protection.
We have already seen the harmful consequences of similar legislation and other states
like Texas, where multicultural centers have been closed and students have been forced
to this ban.
As Senate Bill 120 becomes law, Georgia will follow the same dangerous path already.
Georgia Tech has had these issues surrounding several other student groups you heard earlier
today.
Finally, Senate Bill 120 provides no clear guidance on what is prohibited, leaving educators
in the dark or what they can and cannot say.
This certainly will lead to self-sensorship and the erasure of important discussions in
our schools.
We urge every lawmaker to vote on this bill and we urge the people to wake up on what
is attacking your diversity, equity, inclusion, and history that has made this state great.
Thank you.
Thank you, Attorney Bruce. That concludes our press conference for today. What do we say?
Vote what? Vote no. Thank you all very much.
