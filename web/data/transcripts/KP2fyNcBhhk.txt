Members, you will want to pay attention again to this resolution, a road naming resolution. I'm going to ask the members to stand again if you will. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House resolution 1164 11164? House resolution 1164 by Representative Hugh Glea of the 141st and others, a resolution honoring the life of the honorable Richard H. Smith and dedicating an air change in his memory. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Transportation, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. I'm sure the people of the Columbus and Miss Gogi County are in data to you for bringing this resolution honoring the fair son of the City of Columbus. So Representative Hugh Glea, you're recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I also like to thank Chairman Jasper's House resolution 1164. On behalf of the Columbus delegation, I stand to present House resolution 1164 to honor the life, the legacy, and memory of our dear colleague, Richard H. Smith. The interchange is in the heart of Columbus because Richard remains in our hearts. And I thank each and every one of you, all of you, serve with him and you know how what a great man he was. He's a man who loved God. He loved his family. He loved his community and he loved his state. And we want his legacy to live on in the hearts and minds of the people of Columbus. And with that, I appreciate your favorable consideration of the interchange honoring our dear colleague, Richard H. Smith. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. Y'all know, as I say, Tories, seldom told, as soon forgotten, this will help the people of that travel into Columbus to always say, well, who was that man? Must have been a fine, fine man. And he absolutely was. As all of you in this house will agree, my colleagues. Thank you for the Columbus delegation bringing this resolution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Transportation Committee for recognizing this very, very important man, each one of us, and the contribution he made to the city of Columbus and to our state. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here is none. The previous question is ordered.

Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the motion. I don't know why I get emotional when I think about Chairman Smith as many times he shut me down in the rules committee. If I do. Have all members voted? All members voted this, so the clerk will unlock the machine. On the adoption of House resolution 1164, the yeas are 169, the nays are zero. This resolution, however, is either requisite, constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Members, I'm going to ask you to remain standing for another resolution. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House resolution 1215-1215? House resolution 1215 by Representative Jasper, the 11th and others, a resolution honoring the life of the Honorable David E. Ralston, and dedicating an interstate connector and a bridge in his memory. This resolution I have been referred to with the Committee on Transportation. That committee recommends this resolution be adopted by Committee Substitute. Members, it may be a little unusual, but I won't do it anyway. Before we take up this resolution, Mr. Chairman, some friends of Speaker Ralston are here. A very close friend, his former chief of staff, Spiro Ambrin, and his son Matt Ralston are with us in the gallery. If you're welcome and make sure to show our appreciation to those two fine gentlemen. Chair recognizes another friend of Speaker Ralston's Chairman Rick Jasper's to present the resolution. What an honor. It's what an honor for me to get to do this resolution. This is, we say House resolution 1215 and we were talking about it in the Committee and we certainly want to separate these two because they're just giants among us. This resolution honors the life of David Ralston, the honorable David Ralston, and dedicated interstate connector, a bridge, highway, and his member in his memory. Whereas David Ralston was born on March 14, 1954 in LJ at Dinges Distinguished Son of No. Georgia. Whereas he attended Young Harris College. And later earned his bachelor's degree from North Georgia College and State University, earned his law degree from the University of Georgia. And whereas Speaker Ralston dedicated his life to the service and citizens, the citizens of Gilmer and Fannie Counties, working to make their lives better in any way that he could. Whereas he ran a successful law practice providing sound legal advice and castle to the Blue Ridge, Fannie Countie, and Gilmer Countie for more than 40 years. And whereas in 1992, he began a law distinguished career in public service when he's elected the Georgia Senate and served for three consecutive terms. Whereas in 2020-02, he was elected to the House representatives. Whereas elected Speaker in 2010, positionally held, it tells untimely death. Whereas the Speaker, he's shepherd many pieces of legislation beneficial to the citizens of the great state of Georgia through legislature, including tax relief, criminal justice reform, transportation infrastructure, funding modernization, adoption reform. He had particularly passion for improving health care provided Georgia citizens who struggled with mental health. And whereas on November 16, 2022, he died peacefully at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. Surrounded by his lovely wife, Sherry, his children, Matt, Elizabeth, and other family members. Whereas it is abundantly fitting and proper that this remarkable and distinguished Georgia be recognized appropriately by the educated interstate connector, a bridge, and a highway in his memory. Whereas his legacy will live on for all who travel these connections, and they'll see his name forever being recognized. Therefore, it will be resolved and acted by the General Assembly that the state route five in Maccasual bypassing Fannie County be dedicated as a speaker David E. Rauston Interstate connector. Be it far further served that the new bridge over the Tacoma of County River and Fannie County be dedicated as a speaker David E. Rauston Memorial Bridge. And be it further resolved that the portion of State Route 52 in Gimmer County from Aaron Road west to the Murray County line is dedicated as the David E. Rauston Memorial Highway. And all the good stuff that goes on after that. I just want to say just as for me, the the the land at the Murray County, Mr. Ridley is here with no it is, it oversees Fannie in Gimmer County. Very appropriate. And Speaker Rauston loved that area. If you served with him, you knew it. He told you he made sure he knew it. But Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving us the opportunity to name these two roads after Speaker David E. Rauston. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What a great tribute to a man who's left his imprint on this house. Representative Mary Margaret Oliver knows new Speaker E. Rauston served with him in the Senate and in the House and knew him so very, very well. As many of us in here who had the great honor and privilege to serve, what I think I know one of the greatest speakers ever served in this Georgia House of Representatives since our inception as a state. What a caring, caring man. The things that Chairman has in the resolution are certainly only a small piece of what he's done, his contributions to our state. And to I know to many, if all of us in this room, what he meant to us personally and our lives as well and his strength he gave to us to do the right thing. To always do the right thing. I'm privileged to have known him and even more privileged to have him serve with him. So what a great tribute, Mr. Chairman to your committee. Thank you to the family and to this family, to this family. Now, I can't say it like he did, but I'm going to try. Is there any objection to the previous question? Being ordered. I can't get down there, but I'll get there as close as I can. What do you think, Mr. Clerk? What didn't him close? Was a chair here? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now pass and be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, who he loved dearly, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the adoption of the resolution, House resolution 1215, the yeas are 169, the nays are zero. The resolution heaven received, your requisite, constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Thank you members. We're going to take up a bill now that would have been very important to the speaker of this House, speaker David Ralston. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 14091409? House Bill 14099 represent an elevator to the 123 to be entitled, an act to amend chapter 1 of Title 51 of the EFISCO to George Anitendi relating the general provisions relative to tourists. So it's the limit liability for mental health care providers under certain circumstances. This bill I refer to the committee on public and community health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chairman Leveritt is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. At this point, this is sort of getting like deja vu all over again, I guess, getting to present Bill, see it today, but I'm honored to present you House Bill 1409. A bill that is designed to ensure the provision of mental health care services to the people of our state, those who are in particular dire need of it. So you know, this is an initiative of the speaker and it continues the tradition started by speaker Ralston whom we just honored and continued by speaker burns of trying to address the mental health care needs of our state. But all of our programs and all of the parity we impose and all of the funding mechanisms we adopt will all be for naught unless the mental health care service providers are here to provide the services that our citizens need. This bill is designed to address that issue. As you know, we have extended certain protections to ER doctors and OBGYNs to try to encourage the provision of those services. This bill is patterned after that model. It basically extends the protection by changing the standard of fault from negligence to gross negligence for the mental health care providers who are providing services to some of the most needy. Those who need inpatient services, whether it be acute services, long term or the therapeutic foster care. So this is intended to try to encourage the providers of those services to stay here or to come here to provide those services to people who just so tremendously needed. But a constituency that tends to be a challenging one to provide the services to. So we hope this will encourage that. So it does it primarily by that vehicle. It is a negotiated bill. It has the approval of actors within that industry who provide those services and of GTLA. It was a result of a number of compromises that both of them made in good faith. And we think this will help extend the provision of those services. One thing it will do, we've had some discussion about hoteling here when it comes to defects and providing services to children in need. This therapeutic foster care is an alternative to that. Much more positive, much more useful alternative. So I hope you will join me in supporting this bill. We believe it's good policy and reflects a compromise that is intended to ensure the provision of these services to our, to our very needy, needy part of our population. And we would ask your support for it. Mr. Speaker, I will yield for questions. Gentlemen, does have a couple of questions. Feel yield to representative Newton to your right. Representative Newton's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that this legislation is a piece of legislation that if the House looks at the broader scope, as was mentioned earlier about Speaker Ralston and mental health parity, get the funding that's needed for new medicines and all and that CON reform that we're advancing right now through Chairman Parrish and others to get the facilities we need. So we got the funding and the facilities and the medications. All of it doesn't matter unless you have the professional workforce and doesn't this go along with student loan assistance that we're working on. And this is just one more piece to decrease the liability, the risk that's out there if people are willing to come to Georgia, stay in Georgia and take care of this high risk, but very needy population. That's absolutely right. Representative Newton, I appreciate you mentioning that. This is trying to battle on all fronts and I think it's an essential part of that initiative. Will the gentleman continue to yield one more time? Yes, absolutely. Isn't it true that also that we deserve thanks to go to our friends in the legal field, the trial bar and all who are willing to come to the table together and work on this in a way that helps Georgians get their family members the help they need. Absolutely, Dr. Newton is an attorney hearing that from a doctor. I feel particularly gratified to hear that and thank you so much. We did work together. Thank you, sir, for the legislation. Thank you. Representative Hutchinson, to your right, is recognized if you'll take another question. This is General Neild. Absolutely. Isn't that true that this bill will bring much needed services to children who are in foster care and children with the most severe mental health diagnosis in Georgia? Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. Thank you for bringing the bill. I appreciate it. And thank you for your support of the bill, Representative. And for the service you provide to the people of our state. Representative Rees, to your left, has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Isn't it true that this bill is an outstanding compromise that strikes the balance of taking care of the patient's needs as well as making sure that the protections that are provided legally for patients in this area is still preserved so that all parties feel comfortable and that I am in support of this bill. Thank you very much for that question. I would certainly agree with the gentleman. You have one final question. Representative Barnes to your left. Mottie Barnes to your left. Representative is recognized. Thank you, Mr. General Neild. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for this bill. Is it not true that this bill also help increase providers for impact units in our state? I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. I believe that will be a result of it. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen, has there further questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to support House Bill 1409. And I'm reminded of the words of the poet Robert Browning. I'll let a man's reach exceed his grasp. That's what a heavens for. Thank you very much. I appreciate your support of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here's none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.

All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1409, the yeas are 170, the nays are zero, the bill having received it requisite, Constitution majority is therefore passed. Members, if you will help me join in represents welcoming and acknowledging former representative Marie Metz to the floor of the representative is great. So you look great. Good to have you back with us. And another, oldie by goody, representative J. Neal is good to have your friend. It's good to see you. Good to have you back with us. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 1197 1197? House Bill 1197, my rep'sent of house, into the 170th to be entitled to act to amend Article 2 chapter 7 to title 4080, the fish quoted George annotator relating the impositionary computation exemptions and credits relative income taxes. This bill I'm referring to committee on ways of means that committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Senator Litty, House, to present the bill. Senator Litty, House Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This afternoon I bring you House Bill 1197 that would expand the rules on tax credit. Many of you have become familiar with this tax credit in small towns because if you've visited many small towns across Georgia, it has helped revitalize downtown. And this would extend the tax credit for eight more years. And it's not, you know, when you think of tax credits, you think of a lot of money, but this tax credit has really transformed many downtowns for less than $10 million and it has brought in over $178 million in development into Royal Georgia. And they also, the Royal Development Council realized that housing is quite a problem in the Royal Georgia. And so they've extended a part of this and put another part in it for tax credits for historical structures that provide housing. And this would be with the approval of the Commissioner of Department of Community Health. Many of you see a lot of towns that had two story buildings and they've turned these into loft apartments to get people back down town and we hope that that will do that. And if I have any questions, I would be glad to answer them. If not, I'd like your favor's approval. They will vote. I know you approve that. You do have a question. From someone who knows a little bit about Royal Georgia, the co-chair of the Royal Development Council, Chairman Mac Jackson, to your right, has a question. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Does the gentleman lady yield? Yes, my friend, I yield. Thank you. Madam Chair, is it not true that the Royal Development Council wanted this bill? Yes, sir. And thank you for your work on the Royal Development Council and thank you for Dean Grinch work. Y'all did a wonderful job this summer. Thank you for bringing this bill, Madam Chair. Lady Yeal, you have a question to your left from Representative Kelly from the 16th District. No, I'm ready. I deserve anything he throws at me. I was waiting. Anything he throws at me, I deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman lady yield. I do. I'm not going to take that bait right there. But isn't it true that over the years, you have had disagreements on some tax credits and tax exemptions? That is right. We have had several disagreements on tax credits and exemptions. And my friend, Debbie Buckner, was on my side. That's where a lot of people at different times. I mean, it isn't true. We can both agree that this is a great bill that advances Royal George. And I know no one in this chamber that cares more about Royal George than the lady in the well. Thank you, my friend. Thank you so much. If there are other questions, I yield it well and ask for your favor or support. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of House bill 1197, the yeas are 163. The nay is won. This bill had received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House bill 1180, 1180? House bill 1180 by Representative Carpenter, the fourth and others to be entitled to amend code section 487, 40.26, the fiscal to George Anantaydie relating income tax credits for film, gaming, video or digital production. This bill emperors the committee on ways of means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Carpenter is recognized to present the bill representing Casey Carpenter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House, I come to you with House bill 1180. It's a great day for film in the state of Georgia. This bill seeks to make this program sustainable for all Georgia taxpayers. We came out of the study committee that we did this all season with the Senate to make sure that we evaluated all the tax credits in the state of Georgia. We feel like today we have a bill in front of you that's going to make sure that the taxpayers of Georgia's get the best bang for their buck while ensuring that film continues to thrive in the state of Georgia. I'll go over a couple of pieces of the legislation and then I'll obviously yield for a couple of questions. The first thing it does is it sets a limit at 2.5% of the state revenue number in the budget for transferable tax credits. As it sits today, that will currently be about $900 million that the state of Georgia is dedicating to film. It also gives the upside for the film industry that as the state grows, film will also grow. That was an important piece. Obviously, there was some concern about not knowing how much the state of Georgia were going to be liable for when it comes to film. This will ensure that it is in a sustainable way able to protect the taxpayers but grow the industry. It also raises the minimum spend to $500,000. We felt that was an important piece in this legislation because it makes sure that they were getting the job creation that this program was brought to bring. Finally, it addresses an important issue for a lot of people in this room. Instead of just the peach for the 10% uplift, it addresses nine different areas that they have to meet four of in order to get that uplift. There's a piece in there that was important to my voters and a lot of voters around this room that helps this industry grow outside of the metro area. There's a piece in there for Georgia musicians. There's a piece in there for post-production in the state of Georgia. There's a piece in there for long-term leases with Georgia Studios, Association with the Georgia Film Academy, using 50% of Georgia vendors, 50% of Georgia's crew. Without that speaker, I yield for any questions. Gentlemen, how's it come up with questions representing Fry to your lift? Representative Flaher has a question if the gentleman yields. You used to be back there. You're really moving up in the world there. Representative Fry. Does gentleman yield? Absolutely. Isn't it true that this bill, like you mentioned, will give opportunities for starting musicians in Georgia to be able to have an opportunity, have their music get used in film, which would further their careers, and this will do a lot for the musicians of the state. Absolutely. I appreciate your work on this issue. We both share a love for music, especially Georgia music, so we appreciate your help on this in the legislation. How you yield for another speaker? I'm in Blackman. He's had a hand in this. I believe he has a question up the center aisle. I think it's fair to say he had at least two hands in it there, Mr. Speaker. Yes, sir, I know. Chairman Carpenter, is it not true that this legislation includes, as you alluded to, a measure that ties the credit to the state's budget, providing for responsible, measured adjustments, while also providing protection for taxpayer dollars in any given year? You are correct, sir. I appreciate your hard work on this, and for doing all the listening that you did, making this a good measure for you. I appreciate your help as well. It's really important to say that Georgia is in the top three in the world, we're competing against countries in film, and I think this makes sure that the program is this today that we will continue to dominate this field. I'll yield for one more, and then. One more? Yes, sir. Representative Scofield has a question. Do you? Right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to yield. Yes, ma'am. Just a quick question. How does this bill support those that don't meet the spend or that are independent filmmakers? That's a great question, because there was a lot of concern that raising that minimum spend to half a million dollars was going to do something to ruin independent films. And I will disagree with you on that matter. I think that as we did the research with the applications with the State of Georgia and Department of Revenue, over 75% of the indie films that were filmed in the State of Georgia will continue to be, continue to spend more than $500,000. So I think it does make sure that we're promoting indie films and providing a pathway for all Georgia filmmakers. And with that, I yield the way. The gentleman has yielded the well. The wisdom of the rules committee, we have limited discussion on the bill to 30 minutes for those opposed, 30 minutes for those in favor. I'm going to recognize Representative Tran to speak in opposition to the bill. Representative Long Tran has recognized the speak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to speak in opposition to this bill. There's a saying of it's not broke. Don't try to fix it. We have grown into a competitive industry third in the world because we do not have a cap. I can tell you Canada doesn't have a cap. The UK doesn't have a cap. And other states across our nation are looking at removing their caps. They're looking at what drives Georgia's film industry and they want to mirror that so that they can find that success as well. In 2019, I had the honor to go to Serbia, to film a movie. We filmed in Serbia and we filmed in London. And I can tell you, they didn't talk about competing with New York or Chicago or LA. They told me we're coming for Georgia. Georgia's got an amazing tax film incentive. We're mirroring it. We want films in our part of the world. So we're not just competing with other states. We're competing globally and this industry is rapidly changing. Now for here in Georgia, we want homegrown talent. And we're building that infrastructure. I'm not saying that we never have a cap, but this is probably too soon. We still have brick and mortar businesses rising to meet the needs of the film industry. But if we start to see a hold back from the film industry, what are those who are investing in rental shops, building, creating rental shops or catering companies to meet the demands of the film industry? What are they going to do when they have to stop midway because film production starts to come to a slow or they start going elsewhere? We have had an amazing growth in the last 10 years. I started working in the film industry in 2014 and I can tell you that we still have a long way to grow. We still have to fulfill our promises to all of our growing next generation of film workers, whether they're carpenters, plumbers, electricians. We promised them if they went to the technical colleges, if they went into these fields, they promised them design, catering, electrician, carpentry, that they would have work. And now we're bringing uncertainty to these fields for these kids who have decided to not look for simply a job like a burger flipping job, but a career that they can grow families on. So I have concerns that this will stagnate our industry. In regards to the indie film industry, the indie film isn't just a two-hour feature film length movie. It can be a 10-minute short film. It can be considered a commercial. And we're not talking about big budget commercials for Nike. We're talking about your local store, whether it's your local carpet store, your local car dealership. Losing this aggregation hurts the filmmakers that are growing in those industries. And that's where you cut your teeth. I produced four short films. I have yet to produce a two-hour feature length film. But I have cut my teeth through short films. My first budget was $500. My last short film, which was only 15 minutes long, was $30,000. You don't just jump into industry and start managing million dollar budgets off the bat. You start small. You learn how to manage those budgets and you grow. And I can tell you what the changes were making. It's going to be that much harder for budding Georgia filmmakers to get into this industry. And we want to be the premier place in the world for the film industry across the board. And so I asked this body to really think about what the film industry has done for your community, the growth of it in your community, is it done growing in your community? Will these changes negatively impact the growth of the film industry in your community? I hope we continue this discussion as we go forward, as we look at this bill. I hope that some changes can be made to keep us competitive not to be third but truly become a world class leading film place in the world because that industry is changing and I believe we have the talent right here in Georgia to start leading the way. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will yield the wow. Gerald Moon has yielded the will. Representative Derek Jackson has recognized the speak to the bill, Representative Jackson. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You know the great modern philosopher Jay Z says men lie, women lie, numbers do not lie. In 2007 right here in Georgia the film and television industry was $300 million direct impact. Today the film and television industry direct impact is $4 billion. It is my humble opinion that this bill House bill 1180 sends the wrong message to all businesses that Georgia's commitment is subject to change at any time without notice which creates an environment of uncertainty. Typically business is responses to uncertainty is to take your business elsewhere. We noticed to be true because a lot of businesses in the last 10 years have been coming to Georgia. I quote from the Georgia economic development website. Our portfolio of incentives begins with a tax credit to spur job creation and includes an array of other credits for investing in R&D, shipping through ports and making key expansion investments. Georgia tax exemptions are just as robust. They can save you lots of money and start up and operating costs. In this chamber we often say we do not leave no one behind. That includes small businesses. There's language in this bill House bill 1180 will leave a lot of small businesses behind. Those same small businesses that sustain Georgia during COVID, those same small businesses who came from other states to say Georgia is home. Those same small businesses who also have a dream, that American dream and their investing in film and television industry. Let us not leave small businesses behind with this bill. I strongly encourage you to vote no on House bill 1180. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The representative is yielded the well. Representative Betsy Holland is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Holland. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. The Georgia film tax credit. I don't tell the story very often that it's a little bit because of the tax credit that y'all got stuck with me in this building. Because over a decade ago I sat on the other side of the ropes working in the film industry, lobbying for this state to adopt a film tax credit to bring more television and film production to the state of Georgia. And I want to tell you you did a really, really good job when you passed the tax credit. This was promised what followed that tax credit with brick and mortar studios. The Georgia film academy, which is a blueprint for other states on how to train people and workers to work on productions. And you've built an entire network of support vendors that can feed film and television production. 10, 15 years ago we didn't believe that Georgia would have the infrastructure to be able to support this kind of production. Now more blockbusters are shot in this state than any other state in the United States, including California and New York. We love sticking it to California and New York. This 1.9 billion total state impact would not have happened if this chamber hadn't thought fully come around to the idea of being innovators in the space of production. And yet, and I should say I have tremendous respect for the sponsor of this bill and for the work he has done to advance film production in Georgia as well. I also get the sense sometimes that in this room people have a feeling that they sort of want to stick it to the Hollywood fat cats. I sometimes want to stick it to the Hollywood fat cats. My Netflix bill is too high. I did not love the season finale of Game of Thrones. I wonder why they don't make movies anymore that aren't sequels or reboots or prequels or some other form of existing IP. I think it took the production community way too long to address pay equity. I think they don't do a good enough job of preventing sexual assault and harassment. There's a lot to not like about Hollywood. I'm not up here talking about this bill because of Hollywood. If we lost the film tax credit in whole tomorrow, Hollywood fat cats could make a decision like that to move their production somewhere else. I worked in that industry for years. I promise you, UK is calling. Vancouver is calling. Other states are calling. I worry that if we are not gentle and nuanced in how we work with the tax credit, the people we hurt are not the Bob Eiger's and the David Zazlobs of the world. Those are CEOs of Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery. We're going to hurt Georgians. We're going to hurt the person who drives the car to get people from the airport to the film set. We're going to hurt the carpenters that are building the film sets. We're going to hurt the caterers. We're going to hurt the small mom and pop vintage costume shop that used to just serve theaters and now has grown three times in size to be able to serve films. I have a hard time getting up today. I was joking. I'm in soft opposition to this bill. I think we need the guardrails. I think we need some of the benefits that have been built into this bill, including more incentive to have these productions take place outside Metro Atlanta into some of the more underserved part and underutilized parts of our state. I think we need to make sure that we don't break the bank giving money away to productions. So I think this is necessary, but I mostly want to make sure I'm sending the message across the hall that we need to continue to have a nuanced discussion about how we're implementing this tax credit, how we put up the guardrails in a way that protect the state, but don't scare away the tremendous amount of business that has made billions of dollars of impact for our community. Don't take away the security of the jobs of the people who specifically sought out training or moved to our state because they believed it was possible to have a career in production in Georgia. In trying to make sure that Hollywood pays their taxes and pays their dues, let's just be careful that we aren't hurting Georgians at the same time. So with that I'll say I may be voting no on this bill, not because I have a problem with the bill in total, but because I just want to make sure we're being careful as it continues to move to include our industry friends at the table to be mindful of the local impact and to be making the absolute best possible piece of legislation that we can. And with that I yield the well. Thank you. That concludes those that spoke up close to the bill. We're going to recognize Ripon Crow to speak in favor of the bill. I know you won't take 30 minutes. No sir. Good man. I will be much shorter than that. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to advocate for the passage of House Bill 1180. A pivotal piece of legislation that seeks to amend the existing Georgia Film Tax Credit Program. This bill will sustain our state's position as a leading destination for TV and movie productions while simultaneously ensuring responsible fiscal management and equitable distribution of economic benefits across our communities. Since inception, the Georgia Film Tax Credit has catapulted our state to the forefront of the entertainment industry, attracted a myriad of productions and generating substantial economic activity. However, as the industry has flourished, so too have the associated cost to our state revenues. It is imperative that we implement measures to safeguard our fiscal stability while preserving the attractiveness of our incentive program. House Bill 1180. Thank you. House Bill 1180 introduces critical reforms that strike a delicate balance between incentivizing production companies and safeguarding taxpayer interests. By amending the definition of base investment and establishing an aggregate base investment threshold, this bill ensures that only productions with significant economic impact in Georgia qualify for tax credits. Moreover, the bill introduces new criteria for additional credits, incentivizing productions to hire Georgia residents, utilize local vendors, and make capital investments in our state studio facilities. House Bill 1180 is not merely about fiscal prudence, though. It is about equitable economic development by incentivizing a portion of production activities to occur in underutilized counties promoting workforce development initiatives. This bill spreads economic benefits of the film industry to regions that may have previously been overlooked. It ensures that all Georgians, regardless of their zip code, have the opportunity to benefit from our state's thriving entertainment sector. House Bill 1180 is a testament to Georgia's unwavering commitment to the film industry. It demonstrates our dedication to fostering an environment that is conducive to industry growth while simultaneously ensuring fiscal responsibility and equitable economic development. By providing stability and predictability to both taxpayers and industry alike, this legislation paves the way for continued success and prosperity in the industry for years to come. Our urge you all to support House Bill 1180 and join me in securing Georgia's position as a leader in the entertainment industry all while safeguarding our state's fiscal health and promoting economic opportunity for all Georgians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the bill. The gentleman's yielded the well. That completes those speaking in favor of real now. Have chairs time. Chairman Blackman has recognized the speak to the bill. Chairman Blackman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know it's a long day and we have studied this for quite some time. I did want to highlight just a couple of things that the base investment of $500,000 is the same. I know some have asked for hire, but that is what is required to hit the threshold, hit that 30%. There is an aggregate number that you have to hit at 10 million. There's also a couple of other things. The 2.5% is not a cap. What it is is it is a limit against the state's liability in any given year. We have seen our contingent liabilities run up to the numbers in the $34 and more billion dollars. It does allow all of these productions to take this credit against any tax liability that they have without any limits whatsoever. Finally, I think the underutilized component and the value that comes to Georgia of the 9 criteria of which 4 have to be hit only enhances the value back to the citizens of Georgia and the investment that they are making in this industry that is upwards of a billion plus dollars annually. We have talked to stakeholders for many, many months and looked at this in great detail. Again, I do want to thank Chairman Carpenter for his work on this and all members of the panel in the committee. I think it's been studied and this is a very measured and efficient approach to what we're trying to do for film here in Georgia. Mr. Speaker, that's all I have. I will yield the well. General M. Gieldewell concludes his chair's time. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none of the report the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes.

All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose the chairman Carson's rise? Presumably to rule 133, Mr. Speaker, I ask to be excused from this vote. Gentlemen, has that right in the journal will so reflect what purpose the chairman work has arise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that there's multiple websites where you can look at a ranking of the limits or caps and the opponents of this bill that seem to think they're going to run somewhere else? I don't know where they're going to run to. At the current proposed limit of $900 space on this year's budget, New York is only at $700 million and California is a mere $330 million. So we would still remain the top giver of film credits in the country by a long shot. Sure. The gentleman knows what he speaks. He's looking at numbers for what purpose is representing part rise? Thank you, Mr. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that I support a good part of this bill but I do have some concerns in which hopefully by voting no, we can continue to perfect this bill as it moves across? I respect the gentleman's opinion. What purpose for what purpose is representing the race rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that this bill includes an uplift that's going to help the hub cities around Georgia attract film industry so that this tax credit is truly a tax credit for the state of Georgia and not just film business in Metro Atlanta? I'm sure the gentleman's read the bill and he understands that will impact Columbus for what purpose is chairman Martin rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that while the word cap keeps getting mentioned at various times here that this bill does not cap the amount of credits that can be earned in years? Isn't that true? I've known the gentleman to understand that part of this business over the years. Isn't it true that it only caps at 2.5% of the budget, the governor's revenue estimate, the amount of those credits that can be transferred and used by parties other than the people that earn them and it does not cap the amount that can be earned in year. In fact, isn't it true that it just protects the Georgia tax payer and the revenue estimate while allowing the credits to still be earned? Isn't that true, Mr. Speaker? I think I agree with that. For what purpose does chairman Carpenter rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that being both a Carpenter and a caterer, I can assure you this bill will make sure that film is going to be successful in the state of Georgia? Since you put it that way, thank you. Right. I'm going to recognize one more, and that's chairman Sains. For what purpose does chairman Sains rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that though I remain concerned on the impact on indie films that are ingrately produced in non-metry areas, I do appreciate this body's work in recognizing more communities in the rural areas under this bill, and that's why I'm voting in favor. I'm sure the gentlemen and these members understand the impact of this bill now have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1180, 1180, the yeas are 131, the nays are 34 of this bill having received the requisite Constitution majority is therefore a past. Members I'm going to ask you to give me some indulgence on this next bill. I'm going to call House Bill 1341, 1341 that just passed out on this supplemental calendar. It is in your book. It is in your books. This is the state symbol that we recognize the Georgia Wild White Shrimp as the official state crustacean. And I do have, I will in full disclosure, I do have a personal interest here. The young people down in Effingham County started this and brought it to a vote. They examined all the crustaceans that exist on our coast. And I think it is more than fitting that we recognize the Georgia Wild White Shrimp and what it not only means as a symbolic as a crustacean for Georgia, but what it means to the people of our state and our history. So I won't go any further. If the membership will indulge me on this, when I would appreciate it, you indulges we will be paid back many times over in some one way or the other. Mr. Minority Leader. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1341? House Bill 1341 by Representative Saints of the 180th and others to be entitled back to men, Article 3, Chapter 3, and Title 50 of the official code of Georgia annotated. Relating to other state symbols, so as to designate White Shrimp as the official state crustacean, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Special Rules, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Steven Sains from down in Glen and Camden County is recognized to present the bill on the coast. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And since we just talked about our film industry, I'll start with a quote by a very famous film produced partially in South Georgia, Shrimp is the fruit of the sea and it is now going to be an official crustacean of this state. There's many different ways to cook it and regardless of the ways you enjoy it, we know that the Georgia Shrimpers are hardworking individuals and they have faced many market pressures from our international counterparts. This is just one small way to recognize that while Georgia White Shrimp are by far the best choice for Georgia consumers and all consumers across our nation and we definitely appreciate the STEM Academy and FAM College and Career Academy. Mr. John Carcell's class, they were our junior house budget and research, AIDS who created this through their suology class and did a school project and got the attention of a certain very honorable member of this body and presented to our committee and we're very pleased that this is coming before you for consideration at a very ample time. With that, if I have no questions I'll yield the well. You have a couple of questions and we have a speaker who signed up to speak and I guess he gets to represent you, representative of Nullowitz to your left has a question to general yield. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that these shrimp are so tasty, so delicious and they literally don't even require a backbone to support this legislation? Unlike every member in this body, those shrimp don't have a backbone, you're correct. I'll yield for one more, whereas many as you'd like, Mr. Speaker. Representative Donna who lives in London has a question I think and maybe you can understand what shrimp are about. I do. Does it not true that today at six we're supposed to have fried shrimp, bull shrimp, black and shrimp, shrimp, dumb bow, garlic shrimp, shrimp and grits and smoked shrimp? As long as they're not oysters from your neck of the woods, I'm great with that. I agree with that too. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. I know there's a lot of attention to be taken into this. The gentleman has yielded the well. We're now recognized. We have one speaker signed up to speak and that's German buddy Deloag from down in Macintosh in Glen County's on the coast. Representative Deloag. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Many of you know I published pictures that I take of the shrimp boats passing by my dock on the Saperlo River. This shrimping season before midseason, those boats cease to pass there every day, they tied up at the dock. The dock quit by and they're shrimp, they're catch. And the reason for that was this past year in this country we imported more foreign ponds, groans, shrimp, laced with antibiotics and Lord knows what else than the total consumption in this country. I hope that by next year we're able to come back here and with some kind of legislation to figure out a way to do what the federal government failed to do and that's protect our local shrimp industry. About two thirds of the shrimp industry in the state of Georgia is in Macintosh County and these are people that have been there, five, six, seven, eight, nine generations. And I can tell you from having spent a very brief stint, that means four days on a shrimp boat. It's hard work. And this generation's gone, nobody else is going to come along and do it. It's just too hard. Now I'm going to do one other thing and Speaker's probably not going to like this very much, but Mr. Speaker, I'm just too old to worry about that. This bill came here, the impetus of the First Lady of this house and so I'm going to take this opportunity to say what many of you have said to me. This is a different and a far better house because of the contribution that our First Lady has made and I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you. This is Speaker, I yield the well. Well, what a great day for the processes of our country to be at work with a group of young people get involved in what we do here and what we do in government. Thanks to the kids that young people down in Effingham County who exercise their voices and it was heard by this body. So thanks to the young people down in Springfield and Rankin and Gaiten and all parts of Effingham County. We appreciate your input and I think we're about to act on it. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? I'm going to take a couple of parliamentary inquiries for what purpose is representative Moore rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that while representative Donna Hugh can recite all the names of the cook shrimp that I actually can cook them? I'm sure the lady is correct. I'll just agree with that. For what purpose is chairman Petri rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that representative Lochin and I actually both wanted to amend this bill to name former coastal friend and coastal representative Don Hogan as the state crustacean? You're out of order. I love Don Hogan. For what purpose is representative Leveritt rise? I know he has some light to share with you. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. I've had the pleasure of serving with chairman Lochin and a number of committees and got to know him in my time here in the house. I've appreciated so much his wisdom and his friendship and therefore for that reason he is my favorite white crustacean from the coast of Georgia. There is that. I will take one more for what purpose is representative Westbrook rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Is it not true that even though we have a lot of fun with bills like this talking about cornbread and shrimp, there is actually a very serious purpose under this that my colleagues in the coastal delegation are referred to which is that our Georgia shrimping industry is facing very, very serious existential threats and anything we can do is a body whether it's choices we make as consumers, whether it's supporting this wonderful idea that our youth brought to us, we should do that. Is it not true? I would totally agree with that and I think this is a Georgia growing product and we will take advantage of that as we promote this for the benefit of all Georgians. We further look into this and work with it. Thank you for this house for having a little fun but passing something I believe you will pass in just just a second that will be imported to a lot of Georgians and our well-being. Have all members now voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1341 the yeas are 171 the nasa zero. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Thank you members. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 1023? House Bill 1023 by Representative Williamson the 112th and others to be titled act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 7 of Title 48 of the official go to Georgia annotator relating to the imposition rate computation exemptions and credits for a lot of 10 come taxes this bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substance. Representative Williamson is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I rise today to bring for you House Bill 1023. Quite simply this bill will I'm back up for a second since we've had an income tax in state of Georgia and I believe it was implemented sometime in the 1930s we've always had the same tax on businesses as we have on the personal income tax returns. That's a threat of changing what we passed House Bill 1437 a year to ago we did not have that linked and this bill simply make sure that we keep our corporate business taxes of IE business taxes which includes not only see corporations but S corporations and partnerships in LLCs at the same rate as a personal tax return. Failure to do this is create a lot of confusion especially since we passed House Bill 149 several years ago which allowed all of our businesses that you referred to as pass through entities to pay those due and payable state income taxes on their business returns. At the same rate if absent us doing this it will effectively be out colored at the fact that a rate increase on all these pass through businesses and it's substantial. The majority of our businesses in Georgia are organizing such a way so I'd be happy to answer any questions the body might have otherwise I appreciate your favorable consideration and yes vote for this measure. The gentleman has a question if you'll take it from Chairman Blackman right up the center aisle. Is the gentleman yield? Happy to him this chairman. Isn't it true that there probably isn't a more conservative, a more fiscally conservative person in this body than you? Well I'll take that out. I'm fine. Isn't it further true than I know you to be one of the most important businesses in Georgia? I'm not sure. Is it further true that I know you to be one of the best business people in this body if not in this state? I believe in protecting our businesses in the state because it means jobs over all the Georgians. Well we yield for one more question. Isn't it true that if we don't pass this legislation that we are effectively raising taxes on every small business in Georgia? Each small business that is arguably that's the case. Thank you. Thank you for your work. There are no further questions. I'll yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you Chairman Williamson. Rules committee has limited discussion on this bill as well. We have three folks signed up opposing the bill. You have a total of 30 minutes representative representative Lisa Campbell representative Campbell and will park a total of 30 minutes to be divided amongst yourselves representative Campbell has recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Campbell. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today as a long time business executive and a small business owner who also cares about the economy in parallel to Georgians citizens I rise today to oppose HB 1023. And I'd like to speak to this bill that is proposing to link corporate tax rates to personal income tax rates. And while this concept may seem appealing on the surface a closer examination reveals significant drawbacks that do warrant careful consideration and thoughtful deliberation. Changing the primary way that we fund and invest in Georgia's infrastructure is a big deal. The idea of linking corporate tax rates to personal income tax rates is often and has been presented sometimes as a means to promote fairness simplicity and transparency. And proponents have argued that aligning these rates can create a more equitable distribution of the tax burden and reduce complexity for taxpayers and businesses alike. However, when you really analyze the potential impacts of such a policy there are some concerns that should be addressed. First, linking corporate tax rates to personal income tax rates can introduce volatility and uncertainty into the tax system. It can make it difficult for businesses to plan and make long-term investment decisions. And fluctuations in income tax rates could be influenced by various economic and political factors we know that. And this could result in hindered economic growth. Some studies suggest a correlation between changes in personal income tax rates and corporate tax revenues, but others find little to no significant impact. For example, a study in 2010 found that changes in personal income tax rates have only modest effect on corporate tax revenues, but other factors play a more substantial role in determining the corporate tax rate. I'm curious to know if many of you know that Georgia has the 33rd most regressive state and local tax system in the country according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Linking corporate tax rates to personal income rates may undermine the progressive nature of a tax system and exacerbate income inequality. And this is the primary reason that I'm speaking against this bill today. Corporate profits typically are primarily derived from capital income, which tends to be concentrated among high-income individuals and shareholders. And by directly tying corporate tax rates to personal income tax rates, we risk perpetuating a system where the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay proportionally less in taxes than middle income individuals and low income households. Additionally, research has shown that corporate tax cuts do not necessarily lead to increased investment, job creation, or economic growth. Proponents of linking corporate tax rates to personal income tax rates may argue that such a policy would stimulate investment by reducing the tax burden on businesses. But the studies do not show this. They instead show mixed evidence regarding the efficacy of corporate tax cuts as a tool for promoting economic activity. For instance, a study by the Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded that corporate tax cuts have only a limited impact on investment and job creation. That same study shows that consumer demand, market conditions, consumers play a more significant role in driving economic growth. Moreover the linkage between corporate tax rates and personal income tax rates may create unintended consequences for those same small businesses and entrepreneurs we just heard about. Because small businesses often operate as pass-through entities, meaning that their profits are taxed at the individual level, currently rather than the corporate level. And this could disadvantage these businesses by subjecting them to higher tax rates and the result of that could stiple some entrepreneurship and innovation. This bill has the potential to continue and perpetuate and increase disparities between the share of personal income taxes compared with corporate income taxes. Thus ensuring those who have the least may continue paying some of the highest share of income in the state and local taxes. In conclusion, while this proposal to link corporate taxes to personal income taxes may have some appeal, I hope that with additional and further analysis of this evidence and potential consequences, I've raised some concerns that give you pause because this policy could introduce and exacerbate income inequality and fail to deliver the promised economic pursuits, benefits. Instead of pursuing simplistic solutions that may do more harm than good and specifically at this time in our history, when so many of our bills that we're about to vote on have to do with our communities and our businesses coming here, we should be prioritizing evidence space policy making and more comprehensive tax reforms that are rooted in fairness, equity, and sustainable economic growth for all of us. And for these reasons, I urge you to vote no to HB 1023. Thank you and I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representative Bell is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Bell. I'm recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition of HB 1023. Today, I'd like to address a critical economic policy that is in question. Why should we cut the corporate tax rate? And that, in navigating the complexities of fiscal decisions and economic strategies, is imperative to delve into the multifaceted implications of altering the corporate tax rate. The proposition of reducing the corporate tax rate often arises the premise of stem-linked economic growth, boosting competitiveness and incentivizing investment. However, deeper examination reveals a more nuanced reality where potential drawbacks of such may outweigh the perceived benefits. First, cutting the corporate tax rate is a risk of exacerbating the already known issue of economic inequality, where it's already pressing issue of many economies. Studies such as Pigny, Sass, Scouts, and Zachman have shown that corporate profits, this proportion of high earners and shareholders widen the wealth gap and undermining efforts to achieve economic equality. Moreover, the corporate tax rate would diminish government revenue. Emmanaging resources available to essential public investment reports for congressional budget offices and international monetary fund, highlight the crucial role of public investment and infrastructure, education, and health care for fostering long-term economic growth and enhancing national competitiveness. Additionally, the assertion that corporate tax work automatically translates into increase investment in job creation oversimplifies the dynamics of corporate decision making. Research from GAVL, Urbocker, and Clause have shown that numerous factors influence investment in decisions including market demand. Regulatory environment and the global economic conditions casting doubt upon the efficacy of cutting taxes as the catalyst of substantial growth. Moreover reducing the corporate tax rate may undermine the principles of corporate social responsibility and accountability. Studies from Freeman came, Mattin, and spent underscored the importance of corporate social responsibility and promoted the common good of maintaining public trust and business institutions. So what alternative approaches should we consider? Instead of prioritizing corporate tax cuts, we should focus on reforming the tax system to ensure fairness, efficiency, and sustainability. This involves closing glucose, combating tax evasions, and modernizing the tax policies to adapt it for evolving economic realities. By promoting a level playing field and equitable distribution of tax burdens, we can strengthen public finances and support investment to benefit society as a whole. Moreover, we should explore targeted instances and policies aimed at fostering innovation entrepreneurship and economic diversification. By incentivizing research and development, supporting small businesses and medium-sized enterprises and investing in emerging industries, we can drive sustainable economic growth and enhance competitiveness without resorting to a blanket tax cuts. Trickle Down Economics is a myth, so bought and packaged for decades.

and have improved false only to make the issue of poverty worse. I dare to challenge the four mentioned thought to replace it with flood up policies that would endow a greater purchasing power for all Georgia families. Flood up economies that will increase annual revenue for small and all Georgia businesses. Flood up legislation that will equip Georgia families with the opportunity and the ability to purchase homes and secure housing. Flood up statutes that help swell the higher ed institutions so that young and promising citizens can be and enhance the flood up statutes that can help swell the higher education institutions with young and promising citizens to be the enhanced and innovating workforce and labor force that we all need. I draw the biblical teachings of Matthew 25 verses 35, which states, For when I was hungry, you gave me something to eat. When I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. When I was a stranger, you invited me in. This underscores the moral and spiritual imperative to extend economic mobility to all Georgia citizens and invite them in to the shared prosperity. Incinclusion, cutting the corporate tax rate is not a, cutting the corporate tax rate, it's not a pancia of economic challenges, it's a short-sighted approach that risks exacerbating inequality, undermining public investment and eroding social trust. Instead, let us pursue comprehensive tax reforms and targeted economic strategies to promote shared prosperity, foster innovation and strengthen our economy to benefit all Georgians and their families. For this reason, I urge you to vote no to HB 1023. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the will. Gentlemen, yield the will. We'll part is recognized as speak to the bill. We'll part. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise in opposition to HB 1023. First I would like to thank Chairman Williamson for making additional edits to the additional amendments to HB 1023 after every of some concerns in the rules committee. The initial draft of this bill would essentially have reduced state revenues by approximately $216 million. My understanding is that this current version of the bill that we're voting on will reduce state revenue by approximately $151 million in a regressive manner, primarily to the benefit of large corporations, not moms and pops, but some of those big businesses that are driving out Georgia-based small businesses, which is the concern that I have with this piece of legislation. I think in light of the current fiscal environment that we're in right now, I'd like to take a step back to get a better understanding of as to the lay of the land. For more than 100 years, Georgia's personal income tax rate remained the same in a progressive manner that would help address some of the income and wealth inequalities that we're experiencing today. Of course, a few years ago, with bipartisan support, I'll admit, we moved from that regressive tax code to a flat tax with a large standard deduction. However, because we are now linking this corporate tax rate to that personal income tax rate, which is not yet static, it is still in flux based on certain conditions and trigger mechanisms in which, for the rest of this decade, we can have our personal income tax rate continue to decrease in which our corporate tax, corporate income tax rate would also potentially continue to decrease if those trigger conditions are met. Another concern I have with this bill is the unpredictability when it comes to revenue estimates and collections, especially in a volatile economic environment that we find ourselves in. Now, of course, it was mentioned that this bill is an example of fiscal conservatism. I think fiscal conservatism in some instances can be good, but I think better than fiscal conservatism in my humble opinion is fiscal pragmatism. Let's be clear as to what we are voting on in with the facts. Last thing I'll say is, you know, with the comment made as to whether or not this is a tax increase, I would love to see a fiscal note from the Office of OPB and state audits as to what the actual fiscal impact of this bill will have. I haven't seen or read any sort of indication that if we don't vote on this, we'll see corporate taxes increase. Again, my concern with this bill is the income tax rate in Georgia right now remains in flux. I remain concerned as to the volatility and unpredictability that linking the corporate tax rate to the income tax rate may now create. So for those reasons, I respectfully disagree and urge members to vote no to House Bill 1023. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Mr. Wilk. Appreciate your comments. That completes the members who are speaking opposed to House Bill 1023. Now, we'll hear from a couple of folks who are in favor of Representative Wilkerson. Representative David Wilkerson is recognized to speak to House Bill 1023 in favor of Representative Wilkerson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I come in the support of House Bill 1023 and I understand the concern that members have with cutting the corporate income tax. And I listen diligently as people explain it. So let me give you a little background on what's happened over the last month, for example. I've gone through my community and I've seen the small businesses that were referenced earlier. These could be partnerships. They could be S-corp's. They are also getting a tax break under this. So let's not think about the big corporations. They have the big high-priced tax attorneys because it's not going to impact them as much as it's going to impact the people that live in your communities. And yes, they will hire that high school student that lives in your community. Now as far as the percentages, up until two years ago, when we first had House Bill 1437, the first round I voted against because it did not help the middle class in lower income. The second version of the bill, I did vote to support House Bill 1437 because it gave one of the largest tax cuts to middle class, working class, families that we've done. So yes, the rich may have benefited, but the working families benefited just as much, if not equally proportional. So remember, up until two years ago, these rates did match each other. The rates were the same. All we're doing is linking them. Now I understand the concern about, well, this is going to put the burden on the packs of those working class to pay it. Well if we raise the rate for the working class, we got to raise the corporate rate because they're going to be linked. Okay? So if you raise one, you got to raise the other because they're always going to be linked as they always have been. This will simplify the business taxes that people pay in their communities. So I know I understand the concerns, I get it, but at the end of the day, this is good sound policies for the small business owners that are trying to create jobs for their families and the economic wealth that will pass down through generations. So with that, if anybody has any questions, I'll take them, if not, I'll yield the well. You do have a question to your right in the back, Chairman Tarvan. How's the question? Jim Neal. Yes, I do. You are an accountant, is that correct? I am. I'm a CPA. I don't do taxes, but I understand. Follow it question. Yes. If you were handling a corporate or a business return, who pays those people pay taxes, then how do they charge that to the customer of the store you think and makes the process to cash register go up? Yes. So they answer your question. Yes. Typically, you will not see me increase sales taxes. You will not see me increase everything because at the end of the day, fees are the most regressive form of taxation. So yes, it will be passed on to the bench as well as taxes. It will be passed on. Yes. The customers pay the ultimate thing. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Representative Crowe is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will be even more brief than last time because I think is my friend, Representative Wilkerson, just stated that this just makes sense and it's good policy. For 10 years, Georgia has been named the best state to do business. We did not take this title for granted and states around the country are constantly trying to dethrone Georgia. Continuing to make Georgia and try to replace to do businesses are never ending endeavor. The corporate tax rate in Georgia is one area where we can be more competitive in states like Florida, South Carolina and Texas. States we compete against for economic development dollars and enjoy a lower corporate tax rate than Georgia. By lowering the corporate tax rate, we empower businesses large and small to invest, expand and create more jobs for our communities. This isn't about benefiting corporations. It's about empowering individuals and families who rely on these companies for their livelihoods. A lower corporate tax rate sends a clear message to businesses around the world. Georgia is open for business. It signals to investors and entrepreneurs that we are committed to fostering a business friendly environment where innovation and enterprise are celebrated not stifled by burdensome taxes. But let me be clear, lowering the corporate tax rate is not about sacrificing essential public services or neglecting our responsibilities to the people of Georgia. Georgia enjoys an unprecedented surplus and our RADD fund has been filled to the statutory limit. And a thriving economy fueled by lower corporate taxes means more revenue for vital public services like education, healthcare and infrastructure. It means a stronger foundation upon which we can build a brighter future for all Georgians and urge you all to join me in voting in favor of House Bill 1023. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopt the Committee's substitute? The Chair here's none of the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agree until the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none of the reports the Committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. I have all members voted. What purpose is represented Kelly rise? I want to make sure you inquire with Speaker. State you inquire. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that New York as a state has the fastest declining population in our country with an income tax rate of 8.5% and Utah has a corporate tax rate of 4.85% is the fastest growing and this will make us better closer to Utah than it will New York. The gentleman says states what purpose is leader Beverly rise? Bollabentry inquiry. State you inquire. This is not true that the individual tax rate in the state of Georgia has been lowered over the last couple of years. The gentleman believes what state is or he wouldn't state it. Following Parliament inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State it. Is it also not true that as we tie the corporate income tax rate to the individual tax rate, there will be a gap in the amount of money that revenue that we can collect because the corporate tax rate will come down. Individual tax rates will come down and there will be a burden on the individual more than it will be on the corporation if they're tied together. I'm going to let you members debate that so I'm going to recognize someone else for a Parliament inquiry. The gentleman made a good point. So for what purpose does chairman blackman rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that we have cut the personal income tax more than 10 times the amount that would be cut by this particular piece of legislation? We are reducing tax rates, yes sir. The purpose is chairman martin rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State inquiry. Isn't it true that I believe the leader said earlier that we are lowering the income tax rate on individuals and we're lowering the income tax on corporations and somehow he thinks that's burdening those individuals. I think it's good for us to let him keep their money in that tree, Mr. Speaker. I'm sure the gentleman believes that it to be true. No doubt about that. And all members voted, so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas are on House Bill 1023, the yeas are 138, the nays are 28, this bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, we'll eared the caption to House Resolution 302. House Resolution 302 by Representative Camp, the 135th and others, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution still survive for the appropriation of funds received from certain legal judgments or settlements. This resolution haven't been referred to the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. Our Lady Beth Camp is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a special bill for a number of reasons. Lady will suspend. Okay, Chair Lady, I think we can hear you now. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. This bill is a special bill for a number of reasons. Many years ago, I guess not that many, three years ago, Representative Marvin Liman I went to Speaker Ralston's office to talk to him about this concept and this was the eventual evolution of this bill. But it is a constitutional amendment and it requires all funds that are derived from any legal judgments or settlements awarded to or entered into by the state of Georgia after January 1st of 2025 to be appropriated by the General Assembly. This is supported by the Georgia Constitution. Furthermore, any unanticipated or excess funds that come into the state above 75 million will also be appropriated by the General Assembly. Mr. Speaker, I'm open for any questions if anyone is interested. You have a question for Lady Will you? Yes, sir, I will. Chairman of Propreation's Representative Hatchet to your right has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the Lady you? I do. Thank you for bringing this. Is it true that I support this? Yes, sir. And I appreciate your input on this. Is it also further true that I would support this bill, this resolution even going further and stating that all monies and fees collected by the state or our should be sent to us for appropriation? I agree with you, Chairman Hatchet. And I furthermore state that I would be happy to bring that bill next session. Lady has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for a favorable consideration. Thank you. Thank you. Both of you, major point. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House resolution 302. The yeas are 163, the nays are 6. The resolution haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1105-1105? House Bill 1105, I will send a p-tree to 166. The other is to be titled an act to amend Title 42 of the Fisherhood of Georgia and a Tate of Relating and Penal Institutions. So, it will require the Commission to report certain information regarding the immigration status offenses in home countries of persons who were confined under the authority of the Department of Corrections. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Thank you members. Representative Jesse Petrie has recognized to present the bill, Chairman Petrie. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you today House Bill 1105. And Mr. Speaker, as you know, as you know will, this bill, this bill I've been working on for quite some time, this bill was drafted last year and since that time, last session when I was here and since that time, I've worked with law enforcement to try to tweak it and get it right. And indeed, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you. As you recall, we met the first week of session to discuss this measure and what we're going to do and this bill was dropped in January of this year. I want to make that very clear. Let me reframe 30,000 foot view of what we're trying to do here to make sure we're very clear because oftentimes these issues get obfuscated. So here's what we're addressing today to be very clear. This is a public safety bill. This is a public safety bill. This bill addresses how law enforcement interacts with individuals who are illegally in the country and then break the laws of our country subsequently to be very clear. It is about that and nothing more. That is the population we're discussing today. So let me go through first and just explain the bill to you. Section 2. Section 2 clarifies very strongly that it is the intent of this general assembly to require that law enforcement officials work in conjunction with federal immigration authorities and cooperate with them again for public safety purposes. The statute as you see here uses the word they are authorized to do so. This makes it very clear by requiring that they cooperate with federal immigration authorities, local jurisdictions enhance public safety and they assist the broader mission of enforcing our nation's immigration laws. In line 30 you will see that it requires when a local law enforcement agency is eligible that they apply to enter into memorandums of understanding with federal immigration authorities. An example of that would be a program such as 287G. In line 70 you see that failure to comply can result in the withholding of state funding or state administered federal funding. Section 3. If you look from lines 83 to 106 you're looking at current statutory law. That law has been on the books for 18 years. And what it requires is very simply this, it's the law of the land today. In committee much of the pushback from people was about the current law on the books. So here's what the law says. In a jail in this state when a foreign national is in that jail and they have been discovered to be illegally in the country they must be reported to ICE. How do we do that? We do that through a system called the law enforcement support center, LESC, it's a database that feds you to try to know who's in our country. And so that is the law of the land today in Georgia. It's not always being followed. And so we emphasize that there that is current law. Next in this section below that you see a lot of new language about the process. The process of how we identify, admit and report those inmates that are identified as illegal aliens. What you need to know is that language about the process is currently the process that is used. It is the process that is used to train jailers across this state. It was created by the Sheriff's Association way back in 2006 when the law was passed. We've just taken that language and we've put it into the bill. So that is the current process. We've now put it in statute. I want you to recognize a couple of things though. On line 164, I want you to know that it inmate identified as an illegal alien. Don't not be detained based on that fact. Remember what we're requiring here is the reporting when a foreign national without legal status is in a jail. It's the reporting that is required. They're not going to be detained unless you have Department of Homeland Security or ICE, immigration and customs enforcement, provide a written detainer. They provide a written detainer. We're going to talk about that in a moment. They are saying to local government, we are this individual is a threat to public safety. So on line 172 though, for now, let me mention line 172, note that an inmate shall not be held longer than 48 hours, pursuant to an ICE detainer. ICE detainers are generally 48 hours. Unless, unless you'll see down the line there, there is a warrant sign by federal judge. All right, on down, line 194. On line 194, I want to call your attention to the fact. It makes it very clear here that a jailer who violates all of these requirements in this section, a sheriff, a jailer, would be guilty of a misdemeanor. If a jailer refuses to follow the law of the state, he's violating a misdemeanor. Second, subsequent offenses will be a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. So to summarize this section, we're requiring that when a foreign national is confined in a Georgia jail, a reasonable effort, as the language says, shall be made to verify that they are here lawfully. And if they aren't here lawfully, they must report that. They must report that to federal immigration authorities. That is what is required in that section. Section 4 speaks to immigration detainers that I alluded to earlier. That is a federal government request of law enforcement to maintain temporary custody of an alien, again, 48 hours, 48 hour holds. The 105 requires sheriffs to be very clear and jailers to comply, honor, and fulfill ICE detainers. ICE detainers, by the way, the document includes information on that individual. Remember, they don't know who this individual is. ICE detainer comes back from the feds. Maybe something happened in another state who knows. But that information includes a criminal history, immigration history, immigration violations, if you will, and the potential threat, again, as I said earlier, to public safety. So they're saying to local law enforcement, here's our concern, hold this individual. To be very clear, a detainer is the primary tool used by ICE to gain custody of criminal aliens for deportation in this country. Criminal aliens. Again, as I began, that's all we're talking about today. They must be based more fully, and this is important, on probable cause. Finally, beginning on line 220, you're going to see, we describe how jailers report compliance toward the end there and provide transparency to the public. Right now today, we don't really know how many, we know you've heard me mention, the close to 1600 ICE detainers we have for violent felons in Georgia's correctional system on a state level. We don't really know how many are in our jails. This transparency and reporting is a good thing, a good ad here. Mr. Speaker, I believe that fairly explains this bill. But for instance, an important issue for the people we represent. And I've got, I don't know if you'll notice this, yesterday, did you all see the Gallup Pole yesterday? Gallup Pole yesterday, the number one single most important problem facing the U.S. and a Gallup Pole yesterday was the immigration, immigration yesterday, Gallup Pole. We have never seen a time like this. We have the greatest border crisis in our nation's history, with millions of people ining the country illegally. We don't know who they are as some recent events can attest. This is a common sense approach to strengthening our immigration enforcement and our stance as a general assembly on this issue in Georgia. The people of this state, the people we represent are expecting us to do something. And I think this is a good way to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I hope that fairly explains what we're trying to do here. I'm glad to answer any questions. You have a couple of questions. To your right, Representative Hagen has a question. The gentleman yields. I yield, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You yield. Yes, ma'am, I yield. All right. I just presented a lot, so I want to make sure I'm very clear. This bill does not address legal immigration at all, does it? None whatsoever. None whatsoever. Or does it address immigrants and immigrants?

Wait, this is all about, as I described, those illegally in the country who now are in our criminal justice system. Okay. I want, thank you for watching for so long on this issue to make sure that women in this state are protected from violent offenders who are not in this country legally. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, has another question to your left representative Hilton has recognized for a question. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Beggars. Is General Neal? I'm not. He's not true that the sheriff of my home county of Guinnett County has publicly stated his intention not to comply with OCGA 42-4-14. And by doing so, placing our community at risk and your bill here today will help him encourage him to comply with our code and keep our community safe. That is absolutely correct. Thank you for this bill. You know, the yield represent that Dina has a question. I yield Mr. You left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does General Yeal? I yield. Is it not true that there are four types of immigrants? Those who are citizens, who are naturalized, those who are residents, those who are considered non-immigrants, and those who are undocumented? Is it not true? I believe that's true, sir. Does the gentleman for the yield? I do yield. Is it not true that immigrants, that this law would impact DACA recipients, who have administrative relief, which gives them protection from deportation and the ability to work in the state of Georgia? That is not correct, sir. If someone does not have, if someone has federal authority to be in the country, this won't relate to them. Does the gentleman for the yield? I'll yield for one more. Is it not true that immigrants are big fabric to the state of Georgia, contributing to our workforce, contributing to all the opportunity that Georgia has to offer? Representative, that's absolutely true. No one believes that more than I. You're doing exactly what I described in the beginning. You're conflating the issue. This issue is not about immigrants. This issue is about people illegally in the country, not immigrants. They're two different things. Individuals illegally in the country who subsequently break laws and victimize individuals in our communities. This is not about immigrants, and I'm not going to listen to that rhetoric any further. Any further questions, Mr. Speaker? Do you have Chairman Jasper's to your right? Would like to be recognized for a question if the gentleman will yield. I yield. The gentleman yield for a question. I yield. Chairman Petrie, I really appreciate your diligent work on this subject for a number of years. But is it not true that in the past three years, that over nine million illegal aliens have crossed our borders? Since our current president took office and opened America's borders? That is absolutely correct, Representative. That is absolutely true. It is unprecedented. And by the way, Representative, I would tell you, it's unprecedented from either party in the past. A lot of people don't realize that President Barack Obama actually issued more ice detainers than Donald Trump. So previous administrations have understood well the importance of public safety of defending our nation's border. Mr. Speaker, I think that's enough questions. Unless you'd like me to do otherwise, I'm going to yield the well. The gentleman's going to yield the well. We have a number of speakers opposed any favor that we'll hear from and then we have a minority report. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your presentation. Now we'll move on to the, those opposed will have up to 30 minutes for us to speak in opposition to the bill. And I'll let you work with each other and has you had your debiapery time. The first speaker will be representing Stacy Evans. We'll speak to the bill. Representative Stacy Evans is recognized to speak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. Representative, give the lady a new way. All your attention please proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I rise in opposition to House Bill 1105, not because I excuse any crime, not because I believe in open borders. I believe if you do the crime, you do the time. I make no excuse for anyone who breaks the laws of our state. This law is about misguided priorities. And I believe once again, this body trying to draw the line of priorities for those in law enforcement. I trust those that bring the bill that say this is not about spewing hate or being less welcoming of immigrants. But I do believe it is about stepping on the feet on the hands of law enforcement who are trying to deal with high crime. I'm concerned about crime. I know everyone in here is concerned about crime. And in that situation, I think law enforcement needs to prioritize their time and have control over their own policies and practices without worrying that if they in their judgment, in the moment, in their communities, see fit to spend more time on the streets than dealing with ice. Because ladies and gentlemen, priorities, I don't have, I wish I had better statistics on what I'm about to give you. But Texas is a place where we know there has certainly been an influx of migrants. And the DOJ has stats available for Texas that says that citizens in Texas are two times more likely than an undocumented migrant to commit violent crime. I don't think that's out of whack with the rest of the country. And so if local law enforcement wants to focus on crime as a whole, as opposed to further detaining migrants, I don't have a problem with that. And I don't think anyone in here should. I want to make a couple of quick points too, just to flash the mirror a little bit. Not so much this session, but I recall a session not too long ago where there was a lot of talk about how Democrats wanted to defund the police. And we were very clear. Nope. Never supported a bill. Never wrote a bill. Never signed a bill. Never supported a bill. Never voted for a bill to defund the police. But ladies and gentlemen, take a look at line 70 to 77. Defund the police. That's what this bill does. If we don't like what you do, funds from the sheriff are gone. So I think we can mark it down. Republican leadership, House Bill 1105 votes to defund the police. I don't want to be any part of that. I also want to point out why are we being so selective about the type of prevention that we're going to focus. Let me start over. We all want to prevent crime. And there's many ways and we can't do all the things. We have to be selective. What I want to know is if we're going to be selective about how we combat crime, why do we pick something that's going to have such little impact? I mean, even if you hit the target, even if you end all, you get rid of all the undocumented folks that you think are the ones that are doing all the crime out there, which is statistically just absolutely false. Every community is having a crime problem. And not every community has high volumes of undocumented folks. So even if we hit the target, we're going to leave so many people still in crime-ridden areas. So why don't we pick a better target? Like one in four mass shooters are found to have been prohibited from possessing a firearm. So why don't we prioritize laws that crack down on that? Why don't we have punishments in place for gun stores that sell guns to folks they shouldn't sell them to? Why don't we do that? Why don't we put pressure in that way? Here's another one. 46% of mass shootings, the shooter was a current or former intimate partner or family member of the victim. But yet year after year, women come down here, talk about protecting women and women feeling safe. Year after year, we have begged for a bill that would empower law enforcement, not force law enforcement, but empower law enforcement to get guns out of the house when there is a restraining order against a violent partner. Year after year, we don't even get to vote on it. 46% of mass shootings, the shooter was someone that the victim knew or had recently dated and we do nothing. If we're going to try to hit a target and cut down on crime and protect women, let's do something that's actually going to do that. No red flag laws, none. No laws to even allow people who know in their moments of lucidity that they have mental health issues and they want to make sure that when they have that break, when they are not in their right frame of mind that they won't be able to get a gun and they want to put their own themselves on a list to keep them from getting a gun in their darkest moments. We won't even let them do that. Self-empowerment, self-decisitions. So ladies and gentlemen, I'm not for crime, I'm not for open borders. I wish we did more to control the borders. I wish we did more to control crime. But if that's really our priority, if our priority is really cracking down on crime, really getting done the heart of why these crimes are happening and really protecting women, House Bill 1105 barely touches the surface. So let's get serious, we have the power to do it. Let's vote against this bill and bring up some real bills to protect the women and citizens of this state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies, yield of the well, Representative Ramon has recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Ramon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise in opposition to House Bill 1105. If you will turn with me to page number five on House Bill 1105, sorry, that was not intentional, you will see that there is a list of documents required to verify whether or not a suspected foreign national is actually a suspected foreign national. The booking officer is to obtain at least one of the following documents from the individual, a form I-94, a valid, unexpired passport, including that a visa was issued, a permanent resident alien card form, a valid Nexus card, or a valid global entry identification card. How many of you carry your passports with you everywhere you go? How many of you carry visas everywhere you go? I don't, and I'm pretty sure my passport's expired. So it's already gone downhill. Now, if I am detaining somebody, and I need to verify their immigration status, and I don't take their word for it, and I can't have a family member bring me my passport, now that person is going to be detained for 48 hours to verify their status. What if they're a single parent? What if they have a very strict job where they can't miss a day? It says here a suspected foreign national. I promise you, the majority people in this room would not be considered suspected foreign nationals. And half the time, I mean, you know, I'm pretty light-skinned if I took off my scarf, I wouldn't be one of those people, either. But there are so many people both in this body and outside of this body who would be suspected as foreign nationals and would be unfairly detained until it was proven that they were citizens. Maybe they'll have a driver's license on them great, but what if they weren't the one driving? I leave my wallet at home all the time when I go out to my husband and it drives him nuts. But I don't need it because he's no one driving. What if I'm walking around without him and I get detained? And he can't, for whatever reason, we can't get to each other. A lot of times when we pass these kinds of bills, we forget to think about the implementation of them. We forget to think through some of these consequences for the people that is going to impact the most. And that's normal. We don't experience some of this discrimination. A lot of us in this room don't. But the reality is, if you ask people where I was from and they didn't know who I am, I've gotten the gambit from New York all the way to Greece to the country of Georgia, not the state of Georgia. And so we know that the people suspected to be foreign nationals tend to be those who are most vulnerable and most targeted. We also know they're not going to have these documents on them. And if they're not a citizen, if they're visiting, they might not have their fees on them. So I just wanted to bring that to your attention. My colleague had summarized the other points that I had very simply. So I won't take any more of my time. But I urge you all to please reconsider this bill because I really think in terms of implementation, there's going to be a lot of problems. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies, yielded the way our representative William is recognized, speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First, my condolences, of course, to the loss that has been suffered. I know enough to know that one cannot imagine that kind of grief unless one has been through it. And I have not. Secondly, I think it's important for me to say, in my opinion, it is clear to me that regardless of political party and power, and this was actually referenced earlier, in regardless of words, but focusing on actions at and far from our borders, we as a country actually deeply ambivalent about immigration. Some want to root immigration out, and certainly it cannot be unlimited and must be fair. Yet some of the same people also recognize, either quietly or turning a blind eye towards the role immigrants do play in our essential most backbreaking industries from food and agriculture to manufacturing. We cannot have it both ways in this country and in this state, at least not sustainably. But third and most important, I want to give my perspective specifically on this bill, and this is a perspective coming from a community that of the 180-house districts has the greatest percentage of immigrants, about 50 percent. I am one of those. And I cannot speak for every single person in my community as a whole, but I can say that in this area, which is Gwinnett, that has traditionally experienced the highest rates of crime, violent and nonviolent, and has also most of the so-called dangerous dwelling apartments in the county, there are so many people in this community, including immigrants of all statuses who have clamored for more law enforcement. To be clear, certainly not fear-based, extensively punitive policing or immigration raids or the like, but for proactive, preventative, truly community-based policing that responds to the day-to-day of people's realities. Including the fact that many immigrants here do want to report to police and to government as a whole when things happen. Everything from domestic violence to human trafficking to car thefts to firearms being shot to gangs of which there are several in my community that are active, things that we don't want people to handle by themselves. But also extending to non-emergency matters like graffiti, broken signal lights, broken windows, low-level, non-criminal code enforcement issues. And here I want to explicitly thank our various precinct captains with whom I have closely worked who have responded to this call. They always go to our community meetings. They proactively go out into the community to engage that community in language, to encourage people to trust law enforcement in a time when we know law enforcement is being challenged. I will also thank again the Georgia Public Safety Training Center for working with me and one of our immigrant facing organizations on designing a course for law enforcement on cultural competency and adeptness to bridge that gap. That effort was inspired too by what happened in the wake of the March 16, 2021 shootings here in Atlanta, where we learned that so many in our immigrant communities are vastly under-reporting on incidences like hate crimes. This bill in my strong opinion would be devastating to all of these efforts and could possibly, if not likely, lead to more crime in areas like mine, precisely because even fewer people, including many immigrants like myself who do have their so-called papers, but are scared of being suspected of anything, precisely because so many of them come from countries where police are actually quite devastatingly brutal and above the rule of law. Those folks, much fewer of them, are going to quote, see something, say something. It will also, because of what it could do to family units, hurt children, and along with that, early intervention and anti-gang efforts that we are doing in my community and other communities to prevent violence, both inside and outside of our schools. With that, I will close by quoting one of the law enforcement that I've spoken to recently about this bill and provide their perspectives. This bill could greatly undermine our ability to provide police services to our community here where you reside, he's referring to me. We fight this stigma and you have likely heard me say it at community events that people assume we already check immigration status. This perception results in under-reported crime in the community and victims that do not feel they have anyone in their corner. A woman who is a victim of domestic violence, a victim of robbery, a parent reporting their child missing could have their immigration status checked and be arrested even if they do have lawful status. I certainly don't mind, and this is the perspective of the police officer, arresting and deporting someone committing crimes who is actively working against the community, but this opens the door to adversely affect our victims. Even heroin users, people actively committing felonies under OCGA are given amnesty to encourage them to seek medical help, but we in this community, and I know in other communities throughout our state, still people, still see people afraid to call. We have made great strides in this community to establish and repair trust in our policing, and I'm concerned that this would set us back. If we want to support law enforcement, we should listen to words like this that I've just quoted. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, yield the well. Representing penance is recognized. Speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge, I'm here to urge you to vote no on this bill. While well-intentioned, I am sure it is contradictory, complicated, and confusing, and I will show you why. Oliver Wendell-Homestated, great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their importance, but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest, which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment. We are all well-intentioned here. We want justice for what happened to Lincoln Riley. We don't want violent people who are here legally or not legally to be on the streets, but this bill won't do it. This bill will close our borders. It will not make us safer, and it will not make women safer. The bill calls for a massive new, unfunded bureaucracy that turns every patrol officer away from his primary duties and every citation into an acquisition. This bill continues the chamber's pattern of undoing Governor Diel's criminal justice reforms. Let's look at lines 86 through 88. It changes the definition of what an illegal alien is to whatever violates the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act. The challenge is you will have legal residents, green cardholders caught up in this. A person could allegedly be in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act while also being legally in this country with valid legal status. A lawful permanent resident with the green card shouldn't be part of this definition, but would be part of this definition. The definition of illegal alien should not be based on any violation of the NIA as a whole, but instead should be based on specific statutes within the NIA that renders somebody present in the United States without valid immigration status, whether that be a valid current visa, legal residency, or being a U.S. citizen. This is entirely foreseeable. This isn't something that I'm worried that one person is going to get caught up in, or two, or three. Hundreds of people, or thousands of people will be caught up in this. We had 89,000 convictions in January for traffic offenses. That means that being somebody was driving, an officer pulled them over, had the discretion whether to take them in or not, either issued them a citation or brought them in, and now those people will have to wait up to 48 hours to be decided whether they can be released or not. This will totally up end scheduled bonds as well. People who normally go in on a speeding ticket or reckless driving, if they now have an accent, they're going to be held for 48 hours. And we know ICE, those of us who work in this field, no ICE never responds on time. They take their time. The problem is not what's going on in Georgia. It's with going on with ICE. And Georgia sheriffs should not be responsible for federal immigration law. Georgia sheriffs will be criminalized. Now they're constitutional officers. They answer to the electorate, but they will be criminalized. We are putting exposure on our law enforcement to arrest and conviction because they can't keep up with an unfunded bureaucracy. Let's look at line 178. On 169, right before 169, right before this, it explains that if someone is held for more than 48 hours without a warrant or probable cause, they must be released. That's great. But a few lines later on line 178, it says, you actually need supervisory approval to release someone without a warrant. It's a contradiction. And then in the following section, it repeats how jailers will deal with immigration detainers. But on line 205, it has no time limit when someone could or should be released if there is not a warrant for probable cause. One of the prior speakers also mentioned this, but it's worthy of repeat. If someone doesn't like what your sheriff is doing, they will defund them. That's what the statute calls for. Defunding law enforcement in this one bill, you are putting exposure to arrest and defunding their budgets or their state budgets, not their county budgets, if they can't get bureaucratic paperwork through. And what does that mean? They're going to cover their butts. And what does that translate to? People are going to sit in jail for days longer than they should on simple misdemeanors. If this bill dealt with serious violent felonies alone, you'd have a lot more support. If it didn't redefine what illegal alien is, you'd have a lot more support. This bill needs more time, not to be rushed through in order to satisfy the public's hunger for immediate justice, which will not be granted by this bill. I urge you to vote now. The lady has yielded the well. Representative Pete Marion is recognized as a speak to the bill. Representative Marion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. But after a moment, I'll tell this to my colleagues in the Georgia House of Representative, I ask you to oppose yet another attempt to politicize fear and hatred by resoundingly voting against House Bill 1105. It is easy and tempting during an election cycle to target minorities and immigrants in order to score political points. Let me be clear. Mahar goes out to Lincoln Riley and her family. Justice Mubbi brought swiftly. We support a full investigation that will bring justice to her family and the community in Athens. And while nationality, race, gender, face, or religion and immigration status, play a role in all narratives. Social characteristic should not be used to generalize or condemn the at large Latino community. Since taking office in 2003, I have witnessed again and again ambitious representatives and senators pursue fear as a strategy to attain and maintain elected office. But our community cannot and should not be collectively punished for the horrific actions of one. We have had enough. We have had enough of attempts to promote racial profiling and discrimination. We have had enough compromising our work and underfund criminal justice system. We have had enough blatant disregard of our state, economy and local industry. We had had enough of minorities and immigrants having to refuse police services because they fear being twice victimized simply because their skin is brown or they have an accent. HB 1105 is an overreach. It goes too far. I believe we should take bipartisan action to protect all of our communities. However, this bill will force human beings to live in fear and burden local governments and law enforcement offices by expanding their responsibilities without a penny of state funding being appropriated for the staffing, training, processing or holding of captured human beings. Beels like this discourage also the welcoming environment that many companies look to before relocating or establishing. Nobody wants to have their employees in a place that will not be liked or welcomed. House Bill 1105 will have a chilling effect on our business-friendly environment and our economic development. It will make it harder to our fellow Georgians to navigate in dealing with their government. Colleagues, if we want to be serious about fixing our immigration system, let's encourage the right body, the federal government. We need to hold them accountable for the inaction, no matter the party. We need to encourage to hold members of our respective

the political parties are accountable for putting politics before people. We have the tools and paths toward preventing tragedies, like the ones in Athens. But we must political games aside to realize their potential and prevent any more senseless crimes. I am proud of the future, proud of the diversity in my district in Winnet County, and proud of the growing diversity in this state. So my colleagues, I urge you not to embarrass Georgia again and call on you to vote against HV-1105. The people of Georgia deserve representation that seeks to bring people together, not tear them apart. They deserve better than this. Thank you Mr. Speaker. General, as you are to the well, that completes the members who are speaking opposed to the bill. Now we will hear from those. In favor, we will recognize representative gains to speak to the bill representing Houston gains men in Clark County. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Over the last week, we have experienced the most horrific tragedy. Over the last week, we have experienced the most horrific tragedy in my community. Innocent 22-year-old Laken Riley had her entire life ahead of her. Today our top priority must remain keeping the Riley family, her friends, and the entire University of Georgia community in our prayers. As more and more details emerge about this awful murder, the more we realize how many times this young woman was failed by the systems we have in place. We all know the federal government has failed. The southern border is a disaster. Millions of illegal immigrants have flowed across the border over many years. We also know that local governments have failed. Some local governments have created an atmosphere where those who are here in this country illegally are encouraged. The suspect who committed this heinous murder last week had multiple run-ins with law enforcement as did his brother. When crossing the suspect was apprehended at the border and released into the country, he was later arrested in New York last year and released yet again. He was cited for shoplifting in October and Athens and at the time of the murder, the suspect had an active bench warrant for his arrest from December 20th of last year. Meanwhile his brother had multiple arrests. These individuals should not have been on the streets. Here is what I know. Fixing policy in the face of unspeakable tragedy is not politics. It's doing the right thing to ensure something like this never occurs again. I want to thank Chairman Petrie for his leadership on House Bill 1105. He's been working on this issue for years and as he noted House Bill 1105 had been introduced long before the awful tragedy last week. Since that time we've examined gaps in Georgia's immigration law and added to this measure to ensure we pass a rock solid measure to protect our communities across the state. You've already heard the main components of the bill but I want to again highlight the need for these provisions. Chairman Petrie outlined for you the specifics of how we will ensure Sheriff's Report unlawful foreign nationals and our jails to federal authorities. It's already state law to do so but House Bill 1105 will make dang sure that actually happens. Unfortunately we've learned that's not always been the case. On Monday House Democrats in this chamber objected to House Bill 1415 being read and assigned to a committee thereby walking that measure from quickly moving through the legislative process. I appreciate my friend Chairman Petrie allowing us to incorporate that language into 1105. Georgia law already prohibits sanctuary cities and while no city may claim to be a sanctuary city we have places that have adopted written and unwritten policies that give sanctuary like status. House Bill 1105 will make certain sanctuary policies not get rooted into our local governments. This will require local law enforcement to comply with requests of federal immigration authorities and requires reporting of all criminally legal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. It will ensure that we're eligible local law enforcement agencies apply for memorandums of understanding with federal immigration enforcement to assist with immigration enforcement. This would include programs like 287G. This legislation requires adherence to ICE detainer requests of criminally legal immigrants and jails to allow time for ICE to pick up these individuals. Currently there are several counties where Sheriff's have pledged not to honor these requests. This bill withholds all state and state direct federal funding from agencies that fail to comply. At the end of the day what House Bill 1105 does is ensure our local governments follow the law and the policies we already have on the books and impose strict penalties for those who fail to do so. We cannot afford to have local governments flouting the law and becoming safe havens for individuals who are in this country illegally. I'm confident that if passed House Bill 1105 will make our state safer. While we have a federal government that continues to fail us we're going to make sure the state of Georgia does everything in its power to keep our communities safe. In my opinion there is no bill more important we would consider this year. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen as you are the well the pro-tim of this House representative Jen Jones has recognized to speak to the bill representative Jones. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will just take a couple minutes. After reading through the bill I read through the minority reports and I noted that the minority reports said our caucus represent welcomes a discussion on bills that would help in violence against women. While I would suggest tonight that rather than discussing it let's do something about it by voting for House Bill 1105. The minority report further said we want to work with our colleagues in this chamber to create common sense reform. While I would submit that House Bill 1105 will help us achieve that worthy goal. Additionally since I have been in the House this body in conjunction with our friends across the hall we have strengthened penalties against violent crime and sex trafficking. We have prohibited local governments from defunding the police so that the police including women are better protected and I might add that almost every single Democrat but not every voted against that measure. We have devoted tremendous resources in the state budget and in the tax code to protect public safety and public schools. These measures protect women and this bill will further protect women in particular and their loved ones. The bill does many things but in particular it requires Georgia law enforcement officials to work in conjunction with federal immigration authorities and to utilize all resources made available by the federal government to assist state and local government enforcement officers in the enforcement of immigration laws of the state and the United States. As said by earlier it will prohibit sanctuary-like policies that further jeopardize the welfare of Georgians. In addition it increases the transparency. We talk about transparency a lot of times. We talk about transparency when it comes to schools and just about every other area why not with respect to illegal aliens that are in our state. Particularly those who have heard us have a record of hurting us. They're in jail. It requires public notification of how many illegal aliens are in jail and their offenses. Women and men I might add want to be protected from those we are afraid of. We should not have to be afraid of those who are not here illegally. I submit that by voting for House Bill 1105 you are further protecting the public, children, women and men and I suggest and invite you to vote for House Bill 1105. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representing Ray Martinez is recognized to speak to the bill. Representing Martinez. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise here today to support House Bill 105. I want to commend my good friends, especially Jesse Petrie for his hard work on this bill. This bill has been in the works for as long as I've been here for over a year, maybe longer. So this is not a political bill. This just didn't, he just didn't talk about this just because of what happened a few days ago. This has been in the works for a long time. I'm going to mention a couple of names to you. Catherine Steinley. Kayla Hamilton. Liz Beth Medina and her very own Lakin, Lakin Riley. I'm going to tell you the story. Catherine Steinley was walking with her father one July evening at one of San Francisco's most popular tourist spots. When suddenly they heard a gunshot. Steinley fell to the ground. She looked at her father and said, help me dad. Those will be her last words. The bullet appears to 32 year old, Aorta. She would die two hours later at a San Francisco general hospital. Around the time Steinley's killer, which I'm not going to mention his name, had just finished and nearly four year prison sentence for illegally re-entering this re-entering this country. He was turned over to San Francisco law enforcement officials because of an outstanding warrant for a marijuana related charge that was immediately dismissed. Federal authorities later released him despite a request from federal immigration officials to keep him in custody. I'm going to give you another one. I want you guys to sink in because this could happen to any of us. This could happen to your daughter, to your granddaughter, to your niece, to your friends. This should never have happened to Catherine Steinley. Illigo Immigrant killed three after release, killed three after release from custody. Illigo Immigrant accused of a triple murder in Missouri was previously jailed and released in New Jersey on a domestic violence charges. Authorities said putting the spotlight on the conflict between this. The defendant forced him to ice. Officials said they placed a detainer on this person while he was in custody. But the request, once you listen to this, because it's very important, the request was not honored by the agency and he was notified and he was let go. Murder three. We hear all the time and I cannot make it more clear. We are sons of immigrants. We are. We are. But I believe what Jesse was Jesse's point was and he made it very clear. We are not after. We're not after. The immigrants. We're not. We're not after them. We're not after them. No. No. What we are after is these folks that commit crime. That's what we're after. That is what we're after. I'm going to tell you our focus in this body as a former mayor, as a former city official, my normal one focus when I was representing my city is to keep my citizens safe. Nothing else matters. Infrastructure, planning and zoning, even education. If you're not safe in your community, I failed as a local official. I failed. I can't keep you safe and I have to do everything in my power to keep you safe. I remember just a few days ago, just a few days ago. We passed a bill. A lot of folks passed this bill where we gave a tax credit to secure and store our weapons. Didn't we do that? Didn't we do that? I thought we did it a couple of days ago. It was a majority, I think 160 of us voted for that bill, to keep harm away from our kids by storing our weapons and you get a tax credit. What is wrong? What is wrong by keeping our criminals stored and safe so they could keep our kids safe. Keep our children safe. If we could keep guns and weapons away, I'm sure we could keep criminals away too. Like I said, this is not a political issue. This is a public safety issue and right now some of these cities are failing. I hear people talk about this and it's just amazing. I hear that we need to spend more money. We need to spend more money in Clark County for videos, for cameras. We need to put more lighting in the park. We need to put more videos in the bridges where Mrs. Stanley passed away in San Francisco. We need to spend more money. We need to spend more money. Videos, even higher and more police officers, need to do all that. That's great. That's wonderful. But why don't you concentrate on the core, on the roots of the problem? It doesn't matter how many cameras you got. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how much money you spent. It doesn't matter if you put more trees in the park. It doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. A criminal is going to commit a crime whether you have videos or whether that park is lighted or whatever. I even heard this and I could not believe it. I couldn't believe it. She should have been running with a buddy, with a buddy system, with a buddy system. You're trying to tell me that you're going to blame a person by not running with a buddy system? No. She has every right as a woman to run alone or with a buddy. It is our responsibility and I go back to when I was a mayor. I have every responsibility to keep my citizens safe, whether I'm in a college town, or I'm in a rural town, I go culture town. We need to do something about this. I'm going to tell you a couple of things that I was surprised that I heard. The sheriff in this particular county, Clark County, declared that the sheriff's office would no longer honor detainers set in place by the United States, immigration and customs enforcement, ICE. You want to do it. Forget about the laws. Forget about the federal laws. You just want to do it because you just don't want to do it. Don't know why. I'm going to tell you this is a very serious issue as an immigrant and my biggest worry that I may happen again. It may happen again. I pray to God that it does not happen again. It may happen to any one of us. I cannot imagine. I cannot imagine. I got two boys. I got two sons. I cannot imagine losing a child. Losing a child. I can't. I can't. It's got to be one of the hardest. It's got to be the hardest thing ever to do. I hope we don't have another stungly out there. I hope we don't have another torres out there. I hope we don't have another three deaths out there. I understand that, you know, say, well, Americans do this too. I wish I could get rid of them too. I wish I could deport them, but I can't. But you know what? One crime. One murder is way too much. Way too much. So let's do the right thing. Let's honor these families. Let's honor the Stanley family. Let's honor the Hamilton family. Let's honor the Madina family out of Texas. Let's honor our very own Riley family. Let's do that. Let's do the right thing. Let's get public safety first. And let's put these criminals away for good. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's another previous question is ordered. We'll now have the minority report up to 20 minutes. We'll bring us to minority report. Then we'll have up to 20 minutes for the chair's time. We'll park is recognized to bring us to minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise in strong opposition to House Bill 1105. This is a challenging issue, no doubt. And without a doubt in my mind, I know every single one, every single member here in this body mourns with the family of Miss Laken Riley. And every single member here in this body would want to take action not only to have prevented that horrific murder, but to prevent future instances from that happening again. There is complete unanimous agreement that what happened was unacceptable, but unfortunately there seems to be strong disagreement as to the best way forward. My fear with this bill that was raised by my concerns is that it is overreaching and will cause far more harm than good if this becomes the law. Now, I'd like to just rebut a few things that members of the majority party said and then to go through the bill again to share some additional concerns or to reiterate and reemphasize some of the very excellent points made by my Democratic colleagues. So first, when it comes to protecting women, again, I think there's unanimous agreement here that we want to take every action possible to protect women here in the state of Georgia. As Representative Stacey Evans mentioned, one of the best ways in which we can protect women is to address gun violence against women, which my colleagues to my left here have been clamoring and advocating and doing everything possible to do. Now, I would respectfully disagree that House Bill 1105 is common sense reform. In my opinion, House Bill 1105 repeats the mistakes of the past. Repeats specifically implementation with 287G, which is an incredibly dangerous and harmful program that this bill will mandate every eligible locality to enter into, which again will cause irreparable damage and harm as we've seen it cause and jurisdictions where it was implemented before, including in Guneck County, in which this program ripped apart families, children and families. Now, with respect to transparency, I support transparency, but let's talk about the transparency in which this bill would require. I don't know if I, so lines 222 on page 9 and 10. I've seen Representative Jesse Petrie's bill about this transparency piece, and I always opposed it, and here's why. I think it's okay if we certainly provide additional information when it comes to law enforcement if it has a public safety effect. Simply posting the immigration status of individuals who are detained, I don't understand or can see the public safety effect of that. The only effect that I can see is discriminatory. And it perpetuates a false narrative that undocumented immigrants, non-citizens or immigrants are more dangerous than US citizens. That is not true based on multiple studies, despite that false narrative and perception that continues to be emphasized. US-born citizens are over two times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes than undocumented citizens. US-born citizens are two and a half times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes than undocumented persons. US-born citizens are four times more likely to be arrested for property crimes than undocumented citizens. According to analysis of data from, I think, 2010 to 2018, in the state of Texas. This piece regarding transparency won't actually result in any safety. It will only perpetuate a false narrative that leads to prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Against folks whose information would be posted or those individuals who come from certain ethnic backgrounds from being posted. Now, I, again, based on my understanding in the fears raised about this bill, I would push strongly back that voting for this bill is honoring the family of Miss Riley or those who have been otherwise slain. House Bill 1105 will cause an incredible amount of harm to immigrant families. Let me point you all to lines 38 to lines 40, in which when eligible local agencies, they shall be required to apply to federal agencies, including ICE. That's a mandatory 287G bill. What we've seen 287G do in application here in the state of Georgia is literally separate families, literally tear apart families. Children born in the United States who are citizens are separated from their parents who may have come here unlawfully. That is what this bill will require across the state of Georgia. So I can't see the argument that this will protect women and children. It will cause harm to women and children. Now, as Representative Evans again noted, which I also raised in the Rules Committee, I was very surprised to see that this bill would defund law enforcement. House Bill 1105, again, in its plain language, online 70 to 77. If you're not complying with provisions of this bill that may cause harm, now we're going to defund law enforcement. How is that helping to keep our community safe? How is that furthering the public interest and the bipartisan objective of public safety here in the state of Georgia? Now again, we've seen 287G before. This is not a new thing. And we've seen that those jurisdictions that sign those 287G agreements that it costs local law enforcement 88 to $111 million of funds that are now taken away from public safety purposes to do the job of federal immigration law enforcement. So again, not only will this cause bill harm, not only will this bill defund the police, this Republican bill defund the police, we are now criminalizing law enforcement, criminalizing law enforcement and another section of this bill, if there is a lack of compliance with this harmful piece of legislation. Earlier today, we honored the late speaker, Austin, and one of the things that he said, which I would wholeheartedly agree with, is that the big things required by partisan support, the big things and the challenge that we face today requires us to come together and to work together. When we're talking about border security and the unprecedented wave of migration that we're experiencing, let's take a step back and not be driven by fear, but understand that this is not isolated to the southern border of the United States. We are living in dangerous times. We're living in an unprecedented time in which we're seeing mass migration around the entire world, whether it's migration to Europe, whether it's migration from Middle Eastern countries. This is, and certainly with climate change, we will continue to see mass migration around the world, in which if we are really going to address this issue rather than politicize it, we need to come together as Americans to figure out how we can first and foremost protect our country, and ensure that we are living up to our reputation of being a city on a shining hill, of treating everybody who's coming to these shores with dignity, with dignity and respect, rather than treating them as a city.

or perpetuating the narrative that every single person who's coming here without documentation is harmful. That, if anything, I think undermines and weakens our position as we try to remain a country that can be a light in this world. Now again, I understand the political sensitivities around this issue. I appreciate the respectful debate we've had on this issue. But again, I urge members here in this body to vote no to HB 1105 because of the real harm that this will cause to innocent families, children, and others. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you do the well, that completes my order report. Now we will have Chairman's time, chairman of the committee from which this bill came. Chairman Collins, chairman of Public Safety, Home Institute, Chairman Collins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before I get too much into my prepared remarks, I do want to say a couple of things. The Department of Community Affairs for many, many years provided a jail report. They provided a somewhat detailed jail report that was made available to the public and that was suspended. And I want to thank our friends at the Sheriff's Association because when DCA suspended a jail report or reporting that or collecting that information, the Sheriff's Association took it upon themselves. And so they started with a jail report that they do. And that's one of the reasons why in this bill that we have leaned on them and they've accommodated our request to stand up this information that they get from all the different jails throughout the state. You know, it's one thing to get the information ladies and gentlemen, but they're going to be able to put it together and offer transparency in a matter in which our constituents will have that. Ability to view. So I want to thank them and their cooperation for working with the committee. I also want to put to bed a rumor that I saw in the news media over the last 24, 48 hours. House Bill 1105 was active in our community earlier this year. I made that a priority for the public safety committee because I thought House Bill 1105 was vitally important to the public safety of this state. So I made a commitment to the author of the bill who was a, I would consider an expert in this subject matter. He's worked diligently over the last decade on this type of legislation. And that was something that this piece of legislation is not reactionary. Re-reactionary legislation, I'm sorry. This is something that we've had in our committee for a number of weeks since the session began. House Bill 1105 aims to strengthen existing laws that require shares to report foreign nationals with lawful status in their, in their jails to federal authorities. It's a sad reality that despite the current state law mandating such reporting that there have been instances where this requirement has not been met. This bill is a necessary step in rectifying this situation and ensuring compliance with federal immigration regulation. This bill will send a clear message that adherence to the law is not optional. And that there are consequences for neglecting one's duties to uphold the law. It's the job of our law enforcement officers to enforce the law. Not to decide which laws they wish to enforce. Moreover, House Bill 1105 introduces public reporting requirements for jailers providing transparency to the public. Regarding the presence of illegal immigrants in our jail, illegal immigrants. By making this information readily available, we empower communities to stay informed about matters that directly impact their safety and well-being. This bill sends a strong message by withholding state and state directed federal funding from agencies that fail to comply with this provision. By leveraging funds as a means of enforcement, we incentivize compliance and accountability among law enforcement agencies. House Bill 1105 is a vital piece of legislation that prioritizes safety and security for our communities by ensuring compliance with federal immigration laws. It holds accountable those who neglect their duty to uphold laws and provide transparency to the public regarding immigration related matters. I urge all of you to support this bill and take a stand for public safety all across this state. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield the balance of the chairman's time to my friend representative Houston Gaines. Oh, Chair, the committee's sweet hour, Marcus, sweet hour, my apologies. They do look a little alike, but I'm, Chair's relinquished the rest of his time to chairman Wheat Hour. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First, I want to commend Chair and Petrie for his work on this measure that, as has been said, many times began way before last week. But, y'all, last Thursday morning, as I sat in my office upstairs, my legislative intern turned to me and said, oh my gosh, they're looking for one of my sororities sisters. They hoped that it was the failure of the AT&T system that morning that they just couldn't reach her. We left that day and a couple hours after I left the Capitol, the news broke that she had been found. That evening, parents received a phone call that none of us hoped to ever receive. And the reality is, is that situation just merely highlighted the failures in our system, the failures in our federal government's policy on the border, the failures of states like New York, who had detained this person released him, the failures of local policies like Athens, Georgia, who invite criminals like this to feel welcome. This measure is difficult because it's necessary to, which seems ridiculous, to require somebody to do their job, to require somebody to merely follow the law. My community was angry, is angry. I became very angry, as I thought of my own 22-year-old daughter who was at the University of Georgia, who's run on those trails as a young child, who's in high school kids that are run cross country. Doesn't feel so safe anymore. But as I move past the anger, stage of grief, and enter into the bargaining, I ask of you, I beg of you, to support this measure. This is a good measure to ensure safety, to ensure that people are following the law. This is not punitive, this is not talking about the agencies that are doing their job. There are plenty of great agencies doing good work. There are some that are not. And like many measures that we pass in this body, we're addressing the bad atlas. That is what this is seeking to do here, to follow the law, and to ensure those that don't are held accountable. That's it. And I really beg of you to support this measure. And I will yield the rest of my time to Chairman Petrie. Thank you, Mr. President. The gentleman is yielding the remainder of the chairman's time to Chairman Petrie. Chairman Petrie is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you to my friends on both sides for speaking to this issue, with some passions issue, and all comments are welcomed here today. I do want to begin by, I want to close this out, Mr. Speaker, I don't want to be too long. We have a lot of other important measures to get to, but I do want to, I've been making notes over there about some of the things that have been said that I have to speak to. Let me begin by speaking to the minority report actually speaks to if you, the Department of Homeland Security has a budget of $122 billion. They don't need our local law enforcement to help them do their jobs. That's one of the points here. I want to make something very clear. An iced detainer? It's a request for local law enforcement to help them do their jobs. That's what it is. It's local law enforcement saying we need your help. And as I mentioned earlier, indeed most ice arrest in this country happen with the assistance of local law enforcement. So it's absurd to suggest that they don't need our help. That's indeed exactly what programs like 287GR and it's exactly what an iced detainer is. By the way, Sheriff Conway, I have a quote from him from 2010, there's been some conversation about him that was alluded to where he made it very clear. I am pleased with the program so far, the sheriff said is back in two times. They saved the county millions of dollars and removed many offenders that have committed serious and violent crimes, including aggravated assault, rape, aggravated child molestination, and federally felony drug charges in a long time, law man. But let me speak more fully to some of the other issues. There's been some conversation about defunding the police. Well, that's really absurd because all this bill does is compel sheriff's to follow the law. Not too hard to imagine that, is it? If you follow the law, you nobody's defunded. So what it does is compel people to actually do their job. There was some conversation about, and by the way, I've never suggested, and I haven't heard anyone here suggest, anyone is committing more crimes than another. No one's ever suggested that. I've never suggested that, but I will tell you this. I will tell you that every single crime that is committed by somebody illegally in this country was an avoidable crime. That crime in Athens that has been alluded to never would have happened under Barack Obama or Donald Trump because the border was secure, and that individual wouldn't be here. He said he was here on asylum. He was here for assault. Never would have happened. So here's the deal. 25% of our federal prisons, since the other side brought it up, 25% are aliens, 25%. But I didn't bring up the issue. I never suggested anybody. It's not part of our talking points. Seems to be yours. Let's talk about documents. We had some folks talk about how hard it was to find these documents. I think everybody in this room is carrying their documents, aren't you? Didn't think that was too complicated. 1940, federal law requires that all foreign nationals over the age of 18 carry proof of illegal immigration status on their person. Since 1940 folks, that didn't happen last four years ago. And the list that I provided in that measure, which came from, as you will listen, to what I mentioned earlier, the list in the bill came from the sheriffs for their procedure that they used today to determine. That list is how we prove those are the documents show that only an illegal alien would not have. We want to make sure that we don't capture anyone else in this. Only someone who's illegally here. And again, only will keep repeating it. Only those that are illegally here. And then commit a crime and victimize our communities. A representative suggested that lines 88, 86 through 88 is a change. It is not. That is the current statutory law. The only thing we did was name the act. It mentioned the federal law. That's what it is. That's not a change. So there's been so much to speak to. I'm not going to get into all of it. Let me say this. Let me just end it with this because we're not changing anybody's minds here. Here's the deal. Non-cooperation with the federal immigration authorities. I want to be very clear on this. Endangers public safety. And it makes a mockery out of our nation's immigration laws. Period. The average ice detainer, by the way. I did make a note here. I've looked this up. The average ice detainer. And remember the Biden administration, their ice detainers have dropped by 69 percent. They're not sending ice detainers out for people that have parking tickets. The average ice detainer already has a history of four previous charges. If ice is reaching out to a community to say this individual is not safe, hold them for us, I would think we would all want to protect the people we actually represent. I would think we would want to do that. Our first duty is public safety. Our first duty to the people that elect us is public safety. I would think that we would want to do that. I want to leave, I'll just leave it here. Again, there's no way around this. Every single crime that is committed by somebody illegally here could have been avoided. It was an avoidable crime. There's no way around that. And I think this bill, you know, we've talked a lot about the minutiae. And I'm glad we have. We should talk about detail here. That's what this is for. And I respect everyone's opinion. But I do want to say this. This bill, the end of the day is this. You're either pro enforcement of our nation's immigration laws or your anti-enforcement of our nation's immigration laws. That's what we're voting on. Because that's what we're doing here. It's compelling law enforcement in this state to support and enforce our nation's immigration laws. And I hope you'll join me in that regard. Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the time to be here. I yield the well. Gentlemen has yielded the well. That completes so speaking for against the minority report and the chairman's time. Is there, excuse me, is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitutes withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none of the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed. Will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Chair, here's none of the rules. Have all members voted? For what purpose is representative Roberts, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that I and women around the world know what it's like to live in fear of violent men not feeling comfortable to go for a run by ourselves worried about our daughters doing so? But violent men are everywhere and they come from all over regardless of whether they are undocumented or homegrown. And isn't it further to that we talk about work for shortages in overburden community law enforcement offices and jails? And wouldn't it be better if we pass legislation that assists our local communities in staying safe, not defunding and criminalizing them? I'm sure the lady believes of what she just spoke for what purpose is representative leveret, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that unlike the lady who just spoke I'm not a woman who knows fear. But as an American I do believe that anybody who has violated laws of our country while they're here, whether they are from America or from another country, if there is a hole from another jurisdiction, whether it be a different state or ice, that should be reported to that jurisdiction and that's all this bill requires. I'm sure the gentleman certainly knows and believes in what he speaks. Now we've debated this about an hour or so so we're we're going to move on. Have all members voted. All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1105 the yeas are 97 the nays are 74 this bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of House Bill 1292 1292 House Bill 1292 by reps and a coye of 102nd and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2 224 the fiscal to George annotated relating to recordation and registration of deeds and other instruments. So as required that the clerks of the spirit courts obtain photographic identification cards of individuals who present deeds or other instruments for recording. This bill I'm referred to committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. You ready? Representative Gabe O'Coyay is recognized to present the bill representative. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen colleagues my bill HB 1292 sends a strong and unequivocal message to fraud stars that sell people's homes fraudulently without their knowledge. It simply requires you to identify who you are when you file a real estate documents deed documents with clerks of superior courts. I ask you to vote for this bill because a lot of our seniors have lost their homes and that's unacceptable. Before I yield for questions I want to thank some of the people who helped me craft this bill because as an engineer took a hammer to it and then I got some lawyers who finessed it and thank you Mr. Majority Leader. Thank you Mr. Weep, the majority Weep and where's my friend my Reeves. Thank you so much and also my co-signers thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Minority Leader. Thank you Mr. Majority Leader again. You're not there. I'm Mr. Speaker I know they're going to kill me now but I yield for questions. Oh I don't think so. After you shut down the representative from the coast I think that I'm Representative Dignia from to your left. How's it going to? Gentlemen the recognize. Mr. Speaker does the gentleman kneel? Yes I am going to vote for this bill but is it not true that I got a call from a friend of mine who owns 150 homes and has in the Georgia area and has at least 10 of them with squatters. I wasn't one of the squatters. Yes. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes sir. Is it not true that people sometimes confuse you for me and me for you? Mr. Minority Leader that give them new glasses. They need better glasses to see you better. I'm the handsome one. I've never done that. The gentleman in well is much better looking man than you are. Representative Stinson I don't know what she has to say about this but she does have a question in the back. Representative Stinson's recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Can you explain to me what House Bill 1292 would have to do with the funeral home industry? I used to be angry because I refused to be your customer. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield for that. Gentlemen yield for one more question. Is it a tough one or a tough one? Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Well yield for one more. Yes. Representative Jason Ridley to your right has a question. I want to be bipartisan here. This is gentleman yield. Yes sir. Now you said you was an engineer and you used the word hammer that you took to this bill. Is that correct? Yes sir. Could we get some of your expertise to fix the speaker's hammer where he quits breaking it? Well it does have to stop him he's too strong that's why he breaks them. Could I? We're a great team representative. Yes sir. Or one more comment. You've already got you billing in the well you ain't got a brag on him no more. Yes sir. Mr. Speaker I yield. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. When you have a good bill it doesn't take much to sell it. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered that you're here here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute that you're here here's none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Here here's none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All in favor the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. You have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the past just. Can't make this stuff up. On the passage of House bill 1292 the yeas are 168 the nays are two the bill had received a record of the Constitution majority is therefore passed. The bill isn't written for desire. Congratulations. Representatives. It's a great day in the neighborhood. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Oh, there we go. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? The House bill 499-499. House bill 499, I'm a ripsend of Hitchens 161st and others to be entitled to an actual men article 1 on Chapter 6 and Title 19 of the Fish go to Georgia and Intetti relating to general provisions regarding Alimony and child support. So, it's an authorized child support and insurance policies for disabled children who have reached the age of majority but lack the ability to otherwise support themselves independently. Mr. Bill, I refer to the Committee on Juvenile Justice that Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Members, I want you to pay attention to this bill. This is the one you can talk about when you go back home. Chairman Hitchens has recognized to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to present House bill 499. And this is way out of the area which I'm used to being involved with. But sometimes you just see things that you know aren't right and you need to take a stand to fix it. 12 years ago, after I was elected but before I ever took office, I was invited to go speak to a group called the Navigators. I had no idea what they were about but when I got there I soon found out that the common denominator was they all had children with disabilities. I've been involved with them ever since and they've kind of inducted me into their group. And I've learned a lot of things. Some good, some bad. I've been exhilarated with some of the things they've accomplished and I've had some...

very negative days with disappointments. Well, one of the things I noticed was that they had a much higher rate of divorce within that group than in normal society. And in fact, I was told this morning by somebody who belonged to a similar group that is 87 percent. Very obviously, much of it is probably akin to the problems that they have with a special child and the care and maintenance of that child. I really got upset a couple of years ago when I found out that the non-custodial parent, once the child reaches the age of a majority, just walks, can walk away without any responsibility toward that child from that day forward. And I thought certainly something ought to be done about that. And I saw a couple that I knew who divorced and the mother, as is usually the case, got custody of the child. She's been taking care of that child since he was born. He's now 20 years old. She has very little skill to get a job. The child needs day-to-day care. And it's very expensive if you can find anybody that will care for a child like that. If they have a serious mental or physical disability, you can't find anybody that's going to care for them without being very expensive. And I knew the husband. And what really got to me was his father died. He inherited a business and he subsequently sold it for $30 million. After this very day, he will not provide any support for that child. He's even taking him off his hospitalization. The child suffers from autism. He goes to therapy every Monday and Friday. When he was on hospitalization, he got, it cost $50 each time. Now it's cost $500 each time. I first introduced this bill last year, and it passed unanimously in juvenile justice. When I got back to my office and when I was filling out the forum for rules, I got a call from the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Human Resources. And she told me that if I move forward with that bill, I was going to hurt a lot of people, particularly poor people. And I had no idea initially what she was talking about. And I don't know how many of you have ever dealt with social security insurance. There's a limitation on how much social security insurance you can, if you take social security insurance on how much money you can make. And if you get, if you make more than the limitation, you lose it. And in some cases, you have to pay back everything that you've ever received from. If it's been 15 or 20 years, it could be a substantial amount of money. There are people who usually are already struggling with finances. So what this bill does, and I checked around, I looked at other states, I knew there were other states that had done this, and I found a building in Florida. And the essence of the bill is that they have, they utilize a trust fund. And I've got the quote on here, it's a USC 1396P at all. It's a trust fund, and money can be put into that account, and it won't affect your social security insurance. So what this bill does is I hope to fix the problem that some of these women and their children have to live in abject poverty for the rest of their life when there's a, when the other parent has the ability to help. One of the questions I got in committee was, what about people who don't have the ability to help? Well, that's just like child supporting in any other case. If there's no money, there can't be any assistance. But those who do have the ability to pay, it takes two parents to have a child, even though all of mine are normal, and some of them are in their 50s, you know, I, well, my wife more than I, but there's still some money that changes hands from time to time, and support of those children. So people ask me how my, how my kids are, and I say, well, nobody's asking for money, so think must be pretty good. But, you know, I just think it's the wrong that we can write, and I've worked hard on this. I've appeared twice before the child support commission. I didn't even know there was one over the judiciary. I think Houston gained his own, his own that commission. And the first time they had some issues, the second time they told me that they were good with the technical part of this bill, but they couldn't advocate one way or the other that it was a public policy issue, and it was up for the legislation to determine how we, how we move forward. So I would ask for your favoral consideration, and I'd be glad to answer any questions. Gentlemen, has a question over to you now for Mr. Hilton. Has a question. If you're yielded. I yielded. I don't think my microphone is yielded. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Neal. I yield. He's not true that my wife, Meredith and I, have a beautiful boy chase with the disability. That's correct. He's not further to the divorce rate for parents of a child with disabilities 87%. That's correct. Finally, is it not further to, I thank God, every single day, my wife keeps us in the 13%. I'm sure that's the truth. Thank you, General, for this great, great bill. Gentlemen, for the yield, Representative Mayner to your right has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Is it not true that I am really thankful for this bill? As a physical therapist that worked at children's healthcare seed firsthand, the struggles that families go through with children with special needs and full support of the bill? Well, I appreciate that. And I just think right is right. And this is the right thing to do. Gentlemen, further to your, Representative Jenkins to your right. Has a question. Why you? Roger. Is it not sure that legislation ensures that disabled children are provided for as they reach adulthood? That's correct. Representative Glaze to your left has a question. Is recognize for a question. The gentleman will yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and does the gentleman yield? I yield. I'm going to pause because this is probably one of the best bills that I've heard all day. And the work that you've put behind it, we would say isn't it true that you have gone above and beyond the character and the integrity of an elected official to do this work for disabled children and helping their families support them as they continue on beyond 18 years old. This is a bill that I absolutely say to you. Thank you. And my gratitude is way beyond what my words can say as I take care of my 70 year old brother because my parents are gone and he's been disabled for many, many years. Thank you, sir. Well, thank you. And I don't think many people in society, they realize how common is this, how many disabled children we have. And this one group in Iffingham County, there are about 100 families. I carried a bill a couple years ago and two children got killed and buried in the back yard and I really got into it with some homeschool people and I was queried about it several times and they said because they used homeschooling as a reason to take them out of school and then they disappeared and nobody knew where they were. They were buried, they'd been killed and were buried in the back yard. And there was some question about involving Department of Human Resources and de-facts in the cases to check on the children. And I said, you know, in cases like that, if the government doesn't intervene, who is going to? I mean, they have nobody else to turn to. Gentlemen, has there further questions? Thank you. I yield the will. The gentleman, the caring gentleman has yielded the will. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 499, the yeas are 169, the nays are zero. This bill hadn't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Thank you and congratulations, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 617-617? House Bill 617, the representative of the jaspers of the 11th and others to be entitled and act to amend title 32 of the EFISCOTA Georgia annotated relating to highways, bridges and fairies, so as to provide for the development and maintenance of a statewide freight and logistics implementation plan. This bill emits the committee on transportation. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Jaspers is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Rick Jaspers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 617, the culmination of about four years' work by the Transportation Committee, GDOT and State Planning Director on freight and logistics. This bill has been done to ensure wise planning and implementation of our tax dollars and working on the issues that are all around freight logistics in our state. We had numerous study committees gathering information all across the state and listening to many, many people. What 617 does is to build upon the existing GDOT planning, but with a little bit different focus on implementation. And I know that's what's important when you go home and talk to your folks. It focuses on investments on the core needs by adding to the interstate systems and other state critical freight routes, railroad crossing access, and also truck parking. It requires a plan to consider projects to address the transportation needs in three defined areas, an international trade zone, ocean trade zone, the inland port zones and commercial and industrial impact zones. It requires GDOT to report back to us every February 15 on the progress. Just make sure that the money is doing as it should and this is using the maximum federal dollars that are out there. Section 2 also lays down the future planning of the 2020 freight plan, which was delivered to us this February. And if you'd like a copy, I can certainly provide it, but also makes us look way down the road to 2050. And the planning director is in charge of that. You know, you saw in the budget this year, it takes significant dollars to make a difference in transportation. So it's very important that we focus our money so it is effective. And I know you appreciate it. We voted for it and we'll continue to. Mr. Speaker, that's our plan for freight logistics funding and I'd be glad to ask any questions. Do you know my yield? Yes, sir. Representative Jason Ridley to your right has a question. My friend yield. Yes, sir. Talking about inland ports since I have one in my area with this in any way helped get 411 fixed where it's falling in. In downtown, I believe the inland port is further than five miles from downtown. There ought to be in downtown suit with not. Well, we can move some numbers around. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you. You'll be all asked favorably on this. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Well, this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 617, the yeas are 168. The nays are 0. The bill haven't received. The requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 901? 901. House resolution 901 by Representative Dempsey, the 13th, resolution compensating Mr. Darrell Lee Clark. This resolution haven't been referred to the committee on appropriations. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee sub. Thank you, Dempsey. Chair, Lady Dempsey has recognized to present the resolution. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good evening. I know we've done a lot of things today, but I'm going to tell you all that these two resolutions we're about to do. I'm going to do the first one now are very important to me and to my community and to some very special people that are here with us tonight. The first is House Resolution 902. This is a compensation resolution. I know you all know what that means. That means some- Lady in the wheel were yielded for just a moment. Are you on 02 or 01? I think you said 01. 01. You said 02. I'm sorry. I just want to make sure we're on the right one. proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're correct. We are on 901. I'm so sorry. They are very intertwined. So it is kind of hard to separate a lot of this. I've heard it similar times in my own community that I love and I've been so proud to represent for so very long. I know many of the people who were involved in these cases and it breaks my heart to think that that happened in my own community. 901 is about Darryl Lee Clark. When he was 17 years old, he was wrongly convicted. In that case, there was so much influence and involvement that is so wrong. There was a sexual relationship brought in, manufactured evidence, witness intimidation, coercion, false testimony, and Brady violations, all by people who were there to do the right thing and tell the true story. It is our responsibility as a state today when we make or involved with those who have made that mistake to step forward and take care of that life. The only way that we have to do that is to compensate. He lost 25 years of his life, his livelihood, his ability to get an education to have a family, to spend time with friends and loved ones, and to be in much of the same world that you and I are all in. When the state calls his harm, we should do this as hard as it is. I hope you will all carefully consider voting yes for this tonight and help right the wrong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If there are questions, I will take them. If not, I will yield the well. The lady has no questions. Yes. No, I'm sorry. No questions. Oh, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? That Chair here has done the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? That Chair here has done the report of the committee has agreed to. The Chair here shall this resolution be adopted, now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution, we will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the adoption of House Resolution 901, the yeas are 156, the nays are 6, the resolution heaven received it, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will yeary the caption to House Resolution 902? House Resolution 902 by Representative Dempsey, the 13th, a resolution compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins. This resolution have been referred to the committee on appropriations. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair Lady Katie Dempsey is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and this is House Resolution 902, which is very similar and very intertwined in the same time frame in my community. So I'm not going to repeat much of what I said to you, but I am going to tell you that this is about Joseph Samuel Watkins, a man who spent 22 years of his life in a place that I cannot even imagine or how he did it, and how he has come out, much like Mr. Clerk that I spoke about a minute ago, very humbly, very anxious to not get back at anyone for it, but to have a life. And the only way to move forward is to try to move forward with some financial ability to do that. It is very different when you do your time and walk out of prison. We surround those people with resources to help them integrate back into the community. When you're exonerated, you walk out the door. And that is where they are. This case particularly involved juror Miss Conda buried evidence, false state testimony from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. We have more liability in this case, I think. They are both here with us tonight, and I hope that you will again vote in favor to help them as we go through this process. Thank you. If there are questions, Mr. Speaker, I will take them if not, I will yield the wealth. You have no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable support. The lady has yielded the wealth. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is Chibbon Workhyes or rise? Pardon inter-inquiry? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that, over in the Senate right now, House Bill 364, carried by Representative Scott Hokeham, would remove us from this process and put it in the hands of the judicial branch and other people who were well-versed and educated, and this body passed it almost unanimously, and has been sitting in the Senate for a year. Is that not true? I think the gentleman knows exactly what he speaks to. It's a good bill. Representative Hokeham passed last year with this body, and it's due time that it moved on, so we're going to attempt to justify these horrific situations. Thank you for your inquiry. Have all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House resolution 902, the yeas are 162, the nays are two, the resolution having received, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Good to have you, gentlemen, but sorry you had to be here. Thank you, Representative. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House resolution 1133-1133? House resolution 1133, by Representative Mitchell of the 88th, a resolution urging the United States Congress to pass the Kidney Patient Access to Technologically Innovative and Essential DeFrology Treatment Act of 2023 or the Kidney Patient Act of 2023. This resolution had been further, the Committee on Health, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chairman, Billy Mitchell is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I also want to thank Chairman Hockins and the members of the Health Committee where this resolution was well vetted. This resolution to the United States Congress simply urges them to pass the Kidney Patient Access to Technologically Innovative Essential Neurology Treatments Act. The proposed change by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will exclude separate payment from oral only phosphate-lowering therapies from Medicare Part D and only provide payment in the in-stage renal disease payment system, thereby posing a significant risk to the accessibility and affordability of these medications for dialysis patients. Now this proposal was actually brought to us by the Kidney Foundation as part of their National Effort to Gaines' Report for this bipartisan congressional policy being led by one of our own former state representatives and now member of Congress, Republican Buddy Carter, with that I would urge you a favorable consideration. With the gentleman yielded well for one question, I promise, just one. Certainly, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hockins, to your left, has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just gentleman yield. Yes, I do. Can you repeat that without your notes? Actually, it is the access to patient care act. So that's about as close as I can get without the notes. With that, Mr. Speaker, it's a simple resolution I will yield. I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I would not have subjected you to that. I'm trying to know where he was going. Does there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Holly rise. Probably minute, Mr. Speaker. Tate your inquiry. Is it not true that all of us heard a faint cry of approval from our youngest member in the back? I think you did. He's waving. He acknowledges that. Have all members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House resolution 1133, the yeas are 164, the nays are zero. The resolution having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 663? 663? Chairman Hatchett is recognized to present that I'm letting him to be the captioner. I apologize. I also anxious for you to come to the well. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 663? House Bill 663, by the way, have hatched to the 155th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 7 of Title 31 of the Efficiency of Georgia and Tate are relating to regulation and construction of hospitals and other healthcare facilities so to establish certain rights of minors and adults admitted to hospitals. Mr. Bill Emmer, for the Committee on Health, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. I want the members to give your special attention to Chairman Hatchett. Chairman Hatchett, you're recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this is an issue that was debated in 2021 for quiet.

while it's a substitute more or less to house bill 290 from 2021. And I'm going to try to tell you what exactly is in the bill because there's quite a bit of what I like to call legal ease. So here goes it creates a new category of designated essential caregiver that when a child is hospitalized one of his or her parents or guardian has the right to be with them in the hospital. When an adult is hospitalized he or she has the right to designate one person who shall be allowed to be with them in the hospital. The designated person may be the patient spouse, family member, health care agent appointed via the patient's advance directive for health care. A representative authorized to consent to medical treatment under Georgia law, which includes a spouse, an adult child, a parent, a sibling, a grandparent, an adult grandchild, a first degree adult niece nephew or aunt or uncle, an adult friend who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient and who's generally, generally familiar with the patient's health care views and desires or other caregiver. It allows a hospital or nursing home to limit visitation in certain limited instances for the safety of patients and staff. It allows a hospital or nursing home to require visitors to comply with reasonable safety protocols and where personal protective equipment like masks provided by the facility. It requires the Department of Public Health to develop informational materials about these rights and requires hospital and nursing homes to post this information on their websites. And last but not least, the rights established in House Bill 663 cannot be waived by the state during a public health emergency. I want to thank the Georgia Hospital Association for working with me a lot on this legislation and coming to this agreement. Now those of you who've been here just the last couple of years are used to me just coming to the well on the budget. Prior to that, health care was my passion and I'll tell you that health care is still my passion. And for the last 14 years, I brought bills that I've been passionate about that are huge items for this state and I believe they're important for this state. But ladies and gentlemen, this is the first bill for me that is personal for two reasons. Michael Snipes is a lifelong friend who during COVID spent 110 days in the hospital and 70 days on a ventilator with the assistance of his wife who is a lawyer and who managed to keep herself in the room staying with him and assisted the health care providers kept him alive. Without her presence in the room, he would not be here today. He's not here with us but he is living and breathing. This bill is for the many spouses and family members that this legislation will empower to be with their loved ones. This bill is also for somebody else, my mother, money hatchet who on December 5th, 2020 died from COVID. 17 days earlier, I took her to the hospital knowing that it would probably be the last time I could hug her and she hugged me back. The last time she could see me and I talked with her and former speaker David Ross in reference this when he talked about H.B. 290 because at the time I couldn't come up here and talk about this. I was standing on the helipad at the hospital and she was in her third floor room in ICU looking out her window at me and my sister on the helipad and talking with us. She could see me but I couldn't see her. This is for my mama so if this ever happens in the future that you could hug your mama or daddy goodbye. I ask for your favoral consideration and I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair here is none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none the report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor the passage of the bill will vote yes? All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. All members voted all members voted all members voted all members voted all members voted if so the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House bill 663 the yays are 170 the nays are zero. This bill haven't received a requisite. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. You are mama is proud of you represent the match.
