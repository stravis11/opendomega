It's clear, or you ring the bell, let's get started.

I'm not sure you did.
Well, please take your seats.

keep us, will you please close the doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the fourth House
district representative Casey Cooper to Casey. Thank you speaker colleagues friends and enemies. It's
it's a it's a pleasure to be before you today. Most of you if you don't know me by now, no better than
for me to bring my own pastor down here. So I actually brought a friend that's a pastor. It's kind
of a protectionism thing, if you will. But Eric Gowell is the pastor of
Christ Church in Dalton, Georgia. We share children that go to school together
Christian Heritage, Daniel, Riley and Molly. All three kids work for me at my
wedding venue and he is a man of God. He's a man that loves this community. He's a
man that loves the school that our children go to and we've set on the bleachers
for the last six, eight years together just yelling and screaming trying to
So he believes in victory, but he believes in Jesus if you'll give him your ear. We sure appreciate him being here
We're gonna have a special baptism service for Casey afterwards. So everybody's everybody's invited
This will be his ninth and tenth time being baptized because I'm going to hold him down
to make sure it takes.
Hey, I want to let y'all know how much we appreciate you.
You start out.
I know the miles.
I know the time.
It's a lot and we really appreciate y'all and your service to your communities and your
service to our state, our nation, to the world. So thank you very much for your service.
As theme ladies and gentlemen members of the House of Representatives of the Great State
of Georgia, it's indeed an honor and privilege to be with you this morning. I want to thank
Speaker Burns for the invitation and thank you, Casey, not only for serving Dalton and
District 4 with distinction, but also for being a good friend. So thank you. Lord Willen,
I would love to share just a little bit of encouragement for y'all and then have a prayer.
I'll be honored to pray for you and over you this morning.
As we begin the new year of our Lord, 2025, it is a new year and I always like how they
depict the new year as a little baby, full of promise and expectation.
The old is passed, the new year looms before as fresh and clean, kind of like everything
look like last Friday afternoon and Saturday after what will go down in the
annals is the great blizzard of 25. I was really glad we got two and a half
whole inches of snow in Dalton, Georgia. I was glad I made it to the Wal-Mart
before to get my bread and my eggs and my mill. But we made it but you know when
you look outside and everything was covered in snow it was it was fresh it
covered up all the winter blah it was softening the hard edges and it just
look full of promise just like this new year, endless possibilities. But for all these hopes
and all these new starts and expectations, you know and I know that alongside those hopes,
alongside those excitement of a new year, there's also going to be times of discouragement.
There's going to be times of frustration of anxiety and times of tough, tough times.
And I know that's the case in church life, and I figure that's probably the case for all of y'all here in this August chamber as well
With that in mind because we live in a world that's been broken, been broken by sin
We know that there's always going to be hard times as well as times of blessing and to that end
When you get when you and I when we face those difficult times. I just want to share
share some good news that one of my favorite authors, his name is Paul David
Tripp. I want to share these words with you, these thoughts. He says,
remember that God is never anxious. Remember that God never rings his hands and
wishes he had made a better choice. Remember that God never worries about what's
going to happen next or stresses over how things are going to turn out. God is
never surprised or caught up short. God is never in a situation that overwhelms
and God never fails to detest. Remember that He never makes promises, He cannot keep.
Remember that He's all powerful, absolutely perfect in every way, He's faithful to every word,
He's sovereign over all that is, He's the definition of love, He is righteous, He is just,
He is tender, and He is patient all at the same time. My friends, remember, please,
the God's gotcha if you let him. God's got this if we let him. The good and the bad. That
which brings joy as well as that which brings heartache. He's sovereign over it all. And
God has put each of you in this place and in this time to do great things for your folks
back home to do great things for our state, for our nation, for our world, really for him.
We can't do it on our own.
So I want to share this wonderful verse for you to remember.
Comes from second Peter, one, three, God's divine power, remember this.
God's divine power has given us everything, everything we need for life and for godliness.
Remember that he's got you, that he's got this, and he's giving you everything you need
for life and for living in a way that honors him and blesses others.
So in that great news, I pray that you'll find peace and joy as you go about this very
important work that he has tasked you with.
Would you please let me pray for you now?
Let's pray together.
Lord God, I pray now for your blessing and your protection over these men and women
who make up the Georgia House of Representatives.
I praise you that you are sovereign and that you're patient and that you're gracious and
merciful even with a sinner like me.
Lord, please guide their steps, guide their thoughts, guide their words, guide their actions,
the actions of these representatives and their staff.
May 2025 be the best year yet in their lives, both personally and as they seek to represent
their constituencies to the best of their ability.
Thank you for giving us all that we need, everything we need for life and for godliness.
He's blessed us so that we can be a blessing, and I pray this in Jesus' name.
Amen.
Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, members, you may join Pastor Eric in the
Any room, they have a photo.
Pastor Eric, thank you for those words of encouragement.
We really appreciate it.
Thank you so much for being here with us.
Thank you.
Our doctor of the day today is Dr. Richard Thomas representing Miriam Parish as responsible
bringing Dr. Thomas here today.
So thank you, Representative Parish.
We appreciate that.
Dr. Thomas, thank you for being here and providing.
Great health care for us here in this body downstairs.
If you need Dr. Thomas, you know where to find him.
This may be a historic moment.
So, members, if I can get your attention.
Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan,
the Chair of Committee on Information and Artists.
Chairman Tarvan.
Mr. Speaker, your committee on information and all that's addressed journal from the
previous legislative day and found it to be correct and if I may have a few moments just
to say a couple of things this may be the last you'll suspend just for a minute members.
This probably will be the last week I do this report as we assign new chairman but this
week we're going to look back on the choices we make in our life and the
directions we're going in our life and just so happened I woke up this morning
at 4.30 and read the journal and it was quite interesting it was 111,642
words that's very lengthy for this early but it had everything we did in the
summer from all the vetoes to the Secretary of State for Port and as I look
Through that at the end of this year, if I'm still here, we may have a test on day 40 and the question is going to be
When I look through there there were a hundred and eighty
green
votes up there now that would be unusual to get a hundred eighty but I want everybody to see when we have a total of a hundred and eighty votes
anytime during this 40 day term and
And it won't be a long sheet of paper, I can assure you, because it's hard to get us all here at the same time.
My seatmate here will wait, gave me this, and we are, you know, what we were we choose, and that's where we head, and it's decisions we make in our life.
Now you can add, you can put five years in this 10 or 20, but I'm going to live to be 94, so 20 years from now,
from now, you'd give anything to be this exact age, exactly this healthy, and back in
this exact same moment. Now, take time and enjoy it. Thank you, Ms. Bigger.
Thank you, Chairman Tarvan.
We appreciate your diligent review of the journal over last session and certainly of our
questions.
Al Williams knows how difficult it is to get to 94.
How's that going, Al?
You're looking good for your age, what can I say?
Chairman Tarvin, the chair of the Committee on Information and
Audits, reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found
to be correct, is there any objection to spend with the reading of the journal?
I hope not.
Chair here is none.
The reading of the journal is to spend with, is there any objection to the confirmation
of the journal.
Chair here is none and the journal is confirmed.

Representative Persinger and Representative Gaines for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. September 4, 2024 was a day of immense tragedy for Appalachia High School,
for Barrow County and for the entire state of Georgia.
An evil act of violence took the lives
of four cherished Georgians who were deeply
loved by their families, colleagues, and the community.
Richard Ricky Aspinwall, a beloved teacher, coach,
and most importantly, a husband and a father of two girls.
Christina Earmean, an educator with a loving husband, who reflected joy for teaching and
treated her students as if they were her very own children.
Mason Schimmerport, a friendly 14-year-old student who was creative, had a great sense of
humor and was kind to everyone.
Christian and Gula, a wonderful 14-year-old student who was friendly, kind, loving, and cared for all.
May their memory be eternal. We must keep the families of these beautiful
souls in our prayers to show them the love and the care that each of us I know deeply feel for them.
I commend the quick action of the Barrick County Sheriff's Department.
Barrick County Schools, the GBI, GEMA, Georgia State Patrol, and many others for their work on September 4th and in the days that followed.
Their rapid response saved lives.
Barrow County Sheriff Judd Smith said on that tragic day, this was an act of pure
evil but love will prevail. My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said as recorded in
John 1622, now is your time of grief but I will see you again and you will
will rejoice and no one will take away your joy for the state of Georgia Barrow County
and Appalachia High School. Love will prevail. We'd ask you to please join us in a moment
of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. You may be seated.

celebrate our founders and those that came before us and set in motion what we
need to do to lead, to thrive, to accomplish our goals, and help our community.
And a very special anniversary shout out to Sora Ronda Brunow,
It is her 50th anniversary as a member of Delta Sigma Sigma.

Congratulations, great history there, great history.

of the hostage families who have been impacted by what's
going on in Gaza.
If you would stand the Siegel family, Roman family,
Forgive me, but
Got that good end
First I would like to say
Thank you this past Sunday
We're several of you attending our church and having a moment up at free chapel in Gainesville
It touched many souls and we really appreciate you being there
Number two, I would like to address Aviva and Shear. Aviva is the wife and Shear is the
daughter of Keith Segal, Samuel Segal, who is a current hostage in Gaza. Aviva was also
taken and miraculously, by the grace of God, was released roughly two months after being
captured and our hearts go out to what you've seen, what you've experienced, but you continue
to shed light in the midst of darkness. We appreciate you and truly as a community of people
we're praying for the salvation to pour over and the peace of God to pour over Gaza and
that this two, they will be free.
Two of Maya's family members were kidnapped by Hamas
on October 7th.
Her cousins Yarden, Ramon Ghat, and Carmel Ghat.
Yarden fortunately was returned to Israel
after nearly two months in the pits of hell.
Carmel tragically was murdered by her monstrous captors
in a tunnel in Gaza, along with the American Hirsch-Glober
Poland.
Carmel was a beautiful soul.
She was an occupational therapist from Tel Aviv.
Released hostage children testified
that Carmel kept the children calm by doing yoga with them
in captivity.
Today, Maya travels and continues to tell their stories.
Yarden's sister, Romi Gonen,
has been a hostage in Gaza now for 466 days.
Romi is a 24-year-old, happy young woman
who loves dancing and traveling.
She was brutally kidnapped from Nova on October 7th.
She tried to escape.
She called her mother, seeking guidance and comfort.
for four and a half hours,
Romi stayed on the phone with her mother and sister
before they lost contact.
Yardin has also been traveling the world,
raising awareness for her sister.
Our prayers are that the hostages will be released.
And after this, you are all welcome to meet them
in the anti-room.
Ami Israel Khai and bring them all home now.
Thank you, members, you may be seated.
