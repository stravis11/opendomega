Hope everybody had a great weekend. Got a little rest and relaxation. Welcome to Cross Over Day, 2021. Day 28. We've got a lot of things to get done today and going to be here a while. So we'll just settle in and have a good time doing it. Hopefully we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country, our chaplain this morning, will be introduced by the gentleman from the 147th House District Chairman Heath Clark. Chairman Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know as I was getting ready today, thinking about Cross Over, how we're going to be here for a while. I thought back to last year and we were delayed getting started by about an hour or so because meetings were going on, trying to determine what we were going to do with the rest of session and little did we know what lie ahead for our state at that point. So it's my honor today to introduce Reverend Dr. Darrell Vining. He's the pastor of Hebron Fellowship Baptist Church in Byron. He's been married to his wife, the Anna for 26 years. This month, they're celebrating their 26th anniversary. They have three children, Victoria, Darrell Jr. and Alexandria. And she's actually has served as an intern for Chairman Shaw Blattin for a few years. So she's familiar with this place and been working and involved in serving her community in that way. So past revining, he's a product of Detroit public schools in Michigan. He graduated from CAS Technical High School, then went on to Michigan State University. So he's a Spartan at heart and you can see him around town wearing that hat. It doesn't really fit in with all the Georgia gear. But he went on to Georgia, Bible College and the Minnesota Graduate School of Theology. He's been a resident of Georgia since 1990 and he started the church that he's currently pastor of in 2005. So he has been an anchor in our community, especially over the last year. He's been honored to have many discussions with him about all the issues going on in our communities. He has served as the first African American to be elected as the associational moderator for the Rojobeth Baptist Association in Middle Georgia. And it's 185 year history. He's the first African American to serve in that role. So he has a personal mission to assist others to fulfill the call that is on their life, training up others who are willing to lead by example and by word. My pleasure to introduce to you, Pastor Viny. Thank you, Representative Clark. Mr. Speaker, to all the honored guests and all who have joined us at this time, I'd like to thank you for this opportunity to be with you today. I would like to share with you a passage of scripture from Luke chapter 10. It reads, thusly, on a certain lawyer, an expert in Mosaic Law stood up to test him saying, Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said to him, what is written in the law? How do you read it? And he replied, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself. It's interesting in this story that after a question has been raised by a legal scholar, lawyer, if you will, he wants to know about his personal inheritance while testing the knowledge of the teacher, Jesus, in this circumstance. The question he raises refers to how can I identify or know who my neighbor is. Here we are introduced to some characters that we can all relate to, my friends. Jesus begins to tell the story, a parable of a good Samaritan. And we meet a person with a problem, a few causing a problem, a few folks avoiding a problem, and one willing to solve the problem. And finally, someone who has the means to help with fixing the problem. Each day we live, we choose which of these people we will be. The robber or the robbed, the first passerby, who's the responsible one, the second passerby, who is the religious one, the third passerby, who happens to be the right one with a willingness to do what needs to be done regardless of personal inconvenience. Or we can be the end keeper who shelters and gives rests to many from danger and toil in this world. As a result, we learn about four things, power, position, privilege, and people. What we learn about power is how it can be maximized, whether we are to help or to harm, how we use power would determine this. We measure power in many ways intellectually, physically, mentally, financially, spiritually. It's even been said that there is nothing more powerful than our ideals or our beliefs. In fact, each character in this example have helped convince me that this is still true, that there is nothing more powerful than our beliefs. Secondly, the positions that we choose to take directly impact the application of what our beliefs are. Even the understanding of what others say we believe, the person we are and who we will be, remember to have been, will be clearly seen by what we do with the positions that we chose to occupy. Thirdly, no matter what position we're in, we have a great privilege, an amazing privilege. One that allows us in our representative form of government to execute power of our beliefs, to make something happen, to lift up the ideas that have made this democracy work despite the challenges of the roles we have taken each day. You see, no matter what the power is, what the position, what the privilege is, our greatest resource and asset for our ideas that carry us from generation to generation has been and will always be the people. The people of this great state and this great nation who awaken every morning, prepare to fulfill the role they are to play for this given day. So, Fred, not be encouraged. What you do today is reflective of those beliefs that there is nothing higher than the power of ideas. There is nothing more important than the position you represent. There is nothing more impactful than the privilege that you have to execute the powers of government that is, as Lincoln said, of the people, by the people and for the people. Amen? Now would you stand and join me for word of prayer? Heavenly Father, thank you for this day. Thank you for this moment that will be etched in the annals of time. You have been kind and gracious to us that we stand here in humble adoration to carry out the sacred trust of governance. Bless us this day to be bold practitioners of the powers you have extended in the positions you have placed us as we exercise the privilege to be the voice for the people that each has been sent to represent. This and all of the blessings that you desire to bestow, let them be done to him who will be able to receive us and for the glory of the one who sent him, Jesus, stay in we pray. Amen. Let us now turn for the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the committee on information and audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

exemptions so as to expand the exemption for agricultural equipment this bill eminently unwaison means that committee recommends this bill do pass chair recognizes chairman watson to present the bill thank you mr. speaker members this house i do bring before you eight speak 498 and basically what we're doing here is we're modifying the definition of farm family to allow for farmers that are unrelated to come together and form an entity and still have the same exemption that independently they already have and basically the reason for this is as agriculture is continued to evolve equipment cost more and more very capital intensive and we're finding out that a lot of younger farmers and older farmers are partnered together but they may not be related and so current law does not allow for an exemption on equipment livestock and things that they have on their farm so we're just making that where they can still have the same exemption that they currently have and that's what the bill does it is a a referendum so the voters of Georgia will have to decide on this and mr. speaker i'd be glad to take any questions if there are any if not a yield to well you have a question if

committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute chair recognizes chairman Cooper to present the bill thank you mr. speaker ladies and gentlemen the house I bring you the health house and health committee substitute to house bill 567 the federal government the HHS Department of the federal government has a special committee that studies all sorts of diseases that affect newborns especially now as we know much more about genetics and they make a recommendation to the states on which of these genetic disorders they think will benefit an infant if they are screened early screening early prevents lifelong disabilities or even death currently we screen for about 36 diseases and 400 babies in our state each year benefit from these early screenings because many of them if you

At the early screening, the disease is found. There are ways to prevent the debilitating or deadly problems that the disease incurs. We really lag behind. In 2015, this committee recommended that we add two more screenings to our list. And in 2013, they recommended we add another one. And nothing has been done to date. This will speed up their process. There is already a newborn screening advisory committee in rules here in the state. This would codify it into law. That committee would meet within a year of the recommendations from the Fed. They would make a recommendation to the Commissioner of Public Health, whether we should add that illness for screening or not. And as soon as the commissioner got that recommendation, she would ask OPB to see how much it would cost and make that recommendation to the legislature. If the legislature pays for the screening, that within 18 months, that would be up. And we would be screening for the disease that had been recommended. I ask for your favor, consideration for this bill. And if there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield a well. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. Yes, sir. I'll take one or two. Chair recognizes representative Anola Witts to your left for a question. Thank you, Madame Chair. Is it not true that many parents in Georgia, myself, included in the past have actually sent samples of our newborns data to be screened in other states that actually have more things that they screened for than the state of Georgia has in the past? Repsendee, I was not aware of that, but as I can see why I can concern parent might do that. I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Canon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes, I will. Thank you. How long has a child considered a newborn? How many months? No, they do this screen. As far as I understand, this is a screening that is done in the hospital. With many of these conditions, just even waiting a few days or few weeks can cause damage. Okay, so you yield for a further question. Yes, Representative. So to clarify, you're saying this is a test that happens immediately upon birth. Well, not immediately, but while they're still in the hospital, it's my understanding. Okay, I was trying to get some clarity on when this happens. Not sure that we got that clarity.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 173 is a retirement bill. It contains two parts. The first part provides that ERS retirees get some input into the selection of two board members that sit on the ERS board. They are, these two are elected by the board. It does not mandate that the board accept those recommendations, but it gives the ERS retirees some input into a board member selection on those two. The second part is a part that passed a house last year and got caught up in the Senate. It allows a 10% allocation for any large retirement system to invest in alternative investments. Large retirement systems are defined as any retirement system with an accumulated unfunded actuary or liability of less than 25% Georgia Municipal Association, any pool benefit, any retirement system with more than 50 million in assets and an accumulated unfunded actuary or liability of less than 25% or any retirement system with more than 200 million in assets. There are two exemptions to the retirement systems that are being placed into this. One is TRS, which was just raised to 5% last year. And ERS, which is already at five, has to stay at five for a while. We have some systems in the state of Georgia that are asking for this type of legislation. Some of those are the Gwyneth County School Pension, the City of Atlanta, their General Retirement Fund, the City of Atlanta, their Fireman's Fund, the City of Atlanta, their Police Fund, Marda.

So it's to provide for penalties for the commission of a defensive distracted driver. This bill I refer to the committee on public safety and homeland security that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 247, folks. Three years ago, we passed a hands-free law here in Georgia. And I'm happy to report. Maybe you saw the press release that since that time from 2016 before the law. Let's talk about it in study committee. And all it at 2019 fatalities in total went traffic crash. Fatalities went down 4.5%. And if you consider population growth and traffic growth, they actually went down 12%. So it's a good good storyline. What this bill does is removes the first time a fence waiver. That was a compromise that we made in the process. This was initially done to allow the public time to get used to the law. This was modeled after one other state up in the New England area. And that state has since repealed its waiver statute. As of November 2018, just about five months after our hands free law went into effect, the hands free law here in Georgia had a 99% awareness among Georgia drivers. But the waiver is unenforceable. So if I pulled over in Cobb County and I drive down to Chatham County, those two court systems don't talk to each other in regard to those waivers. In addition, this does keep the fines level, but no increases in the fines whatsoever, 50, 150. This is endorsed and supported by the sheriffs, the chiefs of police, insurance industry, American property casual insurance association, the Georgia Association of Solicitors. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll take a question. And if there's no questions, I'll be yielded well. There are no questions. I yielded well and asked for your favor.

Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 282. House Resolution 282 by Representative Gunner of the 8th, Ralston 7th, a resolution honoring the life and memory of Miss Sydney Grace Jones, and dedicating an intersection in her memory. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Transportation. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes representative Gunter to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Sydney Grace Jones was a young lady up in the North George Mountains. She was a student, a recent graduate of Bannock County High School, very active in her church, active in sports. She was just the all-American young lady that, you know, if you had a daughter, you would hope that she would be that way. She was tragically killed in Union County at the intersection of 325 and 515. Since that time, her family has been working to make this intersection a safer intersection for everyone to travel through. And I'm asking in honor of her that this intersection be named after Sydney Grace Jones and would ask for your support. Thank you. You have no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered.

Reps and a lyrichia of 169th and others to be titled an act to amend Part 3 of Article 3 or Chapter 5 of Title 50, the fiscal and Georgia annotated relating to small business assistance so as to change the definition of small business. This bill ever referred to the committee on small business development that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of the Small Business Development Committee. Chairman Chokus to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House I bring before you House Bill 611. This takes the definition of small business under Title 50 and subdivides it into three tiers. Currently, small businesses defined as 300 or fewer employees or $30 million or less in annual receipts. The subdivision under HB611 will be Tier 1 is 10 or fewer employees or 1 million or less in annual receipts, Tier 2, 100 or fewer employees, with 10 million or less in annual receipts, and Tier 3, the current level, 300 or fewer employees and $30 million in annual receipts. There was no opposition to this legislation and this measure has no fiscal impact to the state. HB611 will enable the state of Georgia to more precisely focus state procurement dollars and offer other incentives to enhance job creation in our small business community. And Mr. Speaker, that's it for the bill. I'll be happy to answer any questions if they're already. You have a question if you care to you. Yes, sir. I'll be happy to you. Chair recognizes representative McLauren to your left up in the gallery. Thanks, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Just for clarity, sake, representative, I guess I'm having a hard time understanding. So there's a this statue would create these three new tiers, but those tiers would not appear anywhere else in code. It would just be for the purpose of administrative granting of dollars. Is that right? Yeah, this tier is under Title 50 and it's to enhance the state's ability to focus its procurement dollars towards small business. Will the gentleman further yield? Yes, sir. So is the idea that the that the administration would promulgate its own regulations for how to treat each tier differently? Well, it depends. It depends on what's going to happen in the future. There's nothing currently happening right now. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. If there are no further questions, I ask there are no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a well and ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none.

So it's to authorize the sale of Patrick's Fishing Paradise to a prognanity. This bill then refer to the committee on state properties that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Hausten to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This House Bill 619 was brought to me by the Department of Natural Resources because it regards Patrick Fishing Paradise that's located in Bearing County that I represent. Patrick Fishing Paradise is made up of approximately 900 acres and it is a fishing operation and we're talking about 8.6 acres that are located on the opposite side of an abandoned railroad track that was abandoned by the Seaboard Coastal Railroad and they have no use for this property. It is not, they're not, this Patrick Fishing Paradise is not involved in wildlife management only in fishing and they would like the opportunity to either lease this land or sell this land and it follows the railroad. I think it's at one point it's maybe 1,100 feet wide at one area and it's on the other side of this and in order to do this we put the, it's in a Heritage Trust. So we've got to take this 8 acres out and you will find the legal description in the bill of this 8 acres so it will not open it up for anybody else to deserve the Heritage Trust because of this bill. It simply involves this 8.6 acres and first of all if they do, if you pass this bill in the government and the Senate and the governor signs it the DNR would have to decide they're board to decide whether they want to lease it or sell it and if they lease or sold it it would have to go out for beds. If I have no, if I have any questions I would go to the other well. You have no questions. Thank you and please vote yes on the other well.

Chair recognizes the chairman of the committee on access to quality health care chairman Newton to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker colleagues I know electronic health records at hospitals is not a very exciting topic at times but when we're healthy we don't think about it much but if you had a family member or an illness yourself you know how complicated that illness can be it can involve an emergency department visit maybe followed by a short hospitalization maybe referrals to several specialists then maybe back to another hospital system for specialized procedures or care it's just a complex thing if you've walked through it with a family member or loved one electronic health records have been augmented by taxpayers to the tune of billions of dollars over the last 15 years for hospitals providers to gain needed access to maintain confidential HIPAA compliant coordination of data to speed needed care and also to allow for a minimization of unnecessary duplication. Unfortunately some proprietary systems if those health care providers work for different systems there are some systems that restrict the availability of that information to other health systems forcing the patient to go to these multiple different areas to gather the information themselves that's hard enough when you're healthy or have someone with you but if you're ill in having a tough time it can be incredibly difficult it can delay care cause a needed breaks in appointments hospital 697 doesn't solve that I got to tell you that it begins a survey though a process to survey the hospitals to have in their annual hospital questionnaire which they already do a lot of information they give us as part of an annual hospital questionnaire it just adds three questions that can be answered actually by their electronic health records vendor those three questions are does your system offer free access for coordination of care for for HIPAA compliant confidential coordination of care if it doesn't do you have a can you tell us what the barriers are and and and what's your timeline for offering this we shouldn't put the burden of gathering this information on on a patient when they're sick even if you're out of the hospital you can still be very ill and very make it very difficult for all this we should we should get the advantage of those billions and subsidies that we all have given as taxpayers to make sure that patients efforts are rewarded and that they that we coordinate this this information behind the scenes to expedite their care and do the best we can for Georgia patients I'm glad to yield for any questions do you yield yes sir chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark in the gallery to your left for a question thank you mr. Speaker does it gentlemen yield yes ma'am so where exactly are the house and senate committees going to do with this survey because the bill states that it goes to these committees what do they do once they get to the general assembly this the effort what we would like to look at is to begin to to formulate depending on what the answers to the barriers are in the timeline maybe to begin to look at ways we can we can assist hospitals we can hit a system with the requirements for their records in the future if that's needed just to open up whatever we can do but without knowing what the barriers are from the electronic health care vendors it's it's just difficult to even formulate a future plan that's a gentleman further yield sure so is there not a study committee that goes along with this and this will just be handled specifically by the health and human services committee in both chambers that's the start that's established in this bill is to let those two committees have the report have the information and then hopefully begin to formulate a patient friendly answer thank you thank you no further questions thank you are you the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of house bill 697 the eyes are 172 the nasa zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed clerk will read the caption the house bill 693 hospital 693 by resident meeks 178 to be entitled like to amend part 1v of article 13 to chapter 6 and title 40 of the official to Georgia annotated relating to operation of a farm use vehicle social prohibit operation of farm tractors on interstate highways this bill I'm referring to the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs that committee recommends a dis bill do pass chair recognizes representative meeks to present the bill thank you mr. speaker ladies and gentlemen I bring to you today house bill 693 house bill 693 is related to farm equipment on on highways as we begin planning season not far down the road we are we'll see a farm equipment moving around pretty frequently what this bill does is that it it's asked to the operator of the farm equipment that as you're approaching oncoming traffic get off on the right side of the road to allow traffic to safely pass but also mr. speaker it provides that if a tractor or piece of farm equipment cannot exit the roadway to allow oncoming traffic to pass due to a bridge a guardrail or another impediment that the oncoming traffic will yield to the farm equipment allowing the farm equipment to safely pass the impediment and then move over to the right side of the road there's nothing in this bill that relieves the the operator of the tractor in operation to make sure that we are are using safety precautions for all oncoming traffic and those persons on the highway so nothing in this bill release the operator of that duty with that mr. speaker I'll yield for questions you have a question if you care to heal yes mr. speaker I'll yield it's from the chairman of the agriculture and consumer affairs committee chair recognizes chairman dicky to your right does Jim and yield yes mr. chairman thank you for bringing this good bill could you tell our fellow members how wide a night road cotton picker is and it's wide is a row is a wider than a row is wider than a row way a six row cotton picker is 38 feet wide lucky actually it's a little it's 19 feet wide the the heads of a tobacco comp of the heads of a peanut combine is right at 19 feet like

Always when we have a traffic sort of bill, I get concerned when a member of the funeral home caucus wants to ask a question.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass. They are recognized as Chairman Carson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, we have an anti-BDS statute. And what that means is it basically protects our relationship with Israel. And what it says is that we're, as a state, we're not going to do business with entities that support the BDS movement. And that is, probe Israel, in other words, the BDS, boycott, divestment, and sanctions. What this bill basically does is basically clarifies the scope of what the intended statute was in regard to. It clarifies that we're going to protect our relationship with Israel because it's a compelling state interest. Our state, as a whole, trades with Israel in regard to agriculture, water desolation, defense, disaster relief, health, and so forth. What this bill seeks to do is clarify Israel in regard to with Israel, or organize under the laws of the state of Israel, or licensed by Israel. And second, what this really does is it limits the scope of the statute to only contracts by the state with Israel for contracts $100,000 of more. As you know, in Title 50, that's the minimum for which a contract must be gone out for requests for bid by the state. So what we've done is, saying rather than contract starting at zero, only contracts that start at $100,000 of more in value. And by doing this, what we're doing is preserving free speech rights. This is taking out individuals and proprietorships and so forth. And we're really saying this is in regard to state contracting with corporations for contracts over $100,000 of more. This is endorsed and asked for by the American Jewish Committee. A vote for this bill is a vote to protect Israel, Israel's interests, and Georgia's relationship with our friends in Israel. I'll stand for a question, Mr. Speaker. You have a few questions if you care to yield. I'll take a question. I'm sure there's one or two others that wish to speak, so I'll take a question, sir. Chair recognizes representative Dukes in room 341. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman yield, I will. I'm trying to get a certain level of clarity as to what this bill is requesting. Is it not true that you're saying that contracts with the state of Georgia is over $100,000? That if what triggers the state not contracting with an individual or firm over $100,000? Sorry, could you repeat the question of what triggers not contracting? Right. Because it seems as if contracts with over $100,000 or not are subject to cancellation. What is it that triggers this cancellation? Let me try to answer it this way, representative Dukes. What will it do with limit the threshold to not any contract of any dollar value, but only contracts at $100,000 or more? In other words, we're not trying to limit the free speech of individuals and proprietorships for small, various state contracts for, say, landscaping or other types of smaller level services. What we're trying to do is focus this on large contracts between corporations and the state of Georgia. Would the gentleman further yield? Yes. Okay, I understand that. I'm somewhat supportive of your measures. Sure. I'm asking for a certain level of clarity. And that is, if I have a contract with the state and I make $100,000 or more on it. What is it that puts my, what is it that I have to do that would jeopardize me getting this contract? What would you have to do to jeopardize this contract is to endorse and support the BDS movement against Israel. In other words, support the boycott, divestment, and sanctions against the state of Israel. Thank you. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I do hope that my colleagues can support the nation of Israel and Georgia's interests with her. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none of the report of the committee is agreed to.

So it's changed the composition of the board of directors of the lottery. This bill I've referred to the committee on regulated industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen in the House. I bring to you this morning House Bill 544. And I think before I get into the nuts and bolts of this bill I need to give you a little bit of history. A lot of the members who aren't familiar with the CoM industry in the state that's the coin operated amusement machines. This has been a longstanding business practice in the state and these are the game machines. And you know to know the history of this is quite interesting. These machines have been around since I guess since there were legal machines. And over the history of these things they've sometimes got out of hand. And then the legislature comes in and we put it back into place. And when I say put it back into place I'm talking about a lot of unscrupulous licensees who would try to pay out cash. Now first and foremost I want to make one point to you. We're not talking about gambling for the sake of money. Because in the state of Georgia gaming and gambling has always been defined as the paying out of cash money. And you know people in Georgia always like to play these different games. But you've got two kinds of games. You've got a class A and you've got a class B. And the class A is what we call the cranes and the ski balls and those kinds. And the class B machines are the ones that people play. And that's the ones where they can win points. And in under Georgia law they can trade those points in for merchandise in the store. They can trade from merchandise. They can trade them a lot of tickets and these type of things. Now over the history of this, over the history of this industry. And I said a while ago it'd been kind of interesting. But then we started regulating these machines around 1970 and started putting license fees and sticker decal, probably decal stickers on these machines to keep them under control. So we could find them. And that happened even a little bit further in 1992. In the 1999, this was when we really had to crack down on a lot of unscrupulous folks. Because law enforcement at that time really didn't want to do what they needed to do about stopping the paying out of cash. Then we rocked on long and in 2013 we moved this whole industry, picked it up out of the revenue department and moved this whole industry to the lottery commission. And over to lottery commission, that was when they progressively started doing a lot of things to promote these machines for the Georgia lottery for education act. Including a few years back that they plugged all of these machines up to a terminal that feeds the information back to the Georgia lottery commission. A lot of times we hear a lot of talk about illegal payoffs. And you can see that every now and then. But I maintain that any of these folks that are that dumb that they would pay out cash and risk a lifetime prohibition and possible being charged as a fellow. That these people lack a lot of shit being the business. And this is an area that we've tried to steer it to for years. You know, last year we heard talk about in the committee, we heard talk last year about certain places down in middle Georgia that had machines and they said, they're paying out cash. Well, I said, you know, we need to know where these are. Well, lo and behold, you found out that these machines were in the back room of a location. They weren't hooked up. So that meant right off the bat that they were illegal and they, those people to be charged with a felony. That's how serious it we've taken this industry over the years because it brings in a lot of money to the lottery commission. As a matter of fact, this is the revenue from these machines since it's one of the highest taxed areas of business in the state. These machines and the operators attacked right at 17%. But even with that, the money that has come into the lottery this past year in this past year in 2020, it brought in $91 million in revenue and $11 million in fees for stickers and such as that. Now, the nature of this business is you have master license holders. These are the folks that furnish the machines and then you have the retail license holders. They're the ones that have them in their locations. So you've got two different sides to that coin that are paying taxes and revenues. So what we have ladies and gentlemen as a situation that historically, this has been such a competitive business that we have to have certain rules and regulations over the lottery commission and hearing officers and judges and such to be sure that this type of an industry continues to be highly regulated for the benefited George and for the benefit of the lottery. Then that brings us to this bill. We had spent several years since the general assembly had done an upgrade bill. But after consultation with the lottery and a lot of the people who are involved in this enterprise and we brought you today House Bill 544. And I'll give you a quick quick synopsis by the lines. But because of the interest in how much money this industry is bringing into the lottery, then what after consultation with the second floor, we've decided that the CoA Ministry, one is that the governor could appoint one additional member to the lottery board who comes or has an interest or a knowledge of the CoA Ministry. Secondly, that the chairperson of the CoA advisory board who the governor currently appoints would also have, have a seat at that table for the lottery commission. This codifies existing case law that a lawful CoA is what it is and that any criminal behavior is levied on the person who violates the law. Redemptions, the redemption language is clarified that if it's legal to purchase and you can redeem for it. On the class A machines, we put a cap at $50 on the merchandise that goes into these type of machines. We define non-cash gift cards. One of the things that we had decided that has been a boom would be for these merchants that are redeeming these type of points that if they sell a gift card and these are non-cash-renammable gift cards no matter where they are whether it's a home depot or a Walmart or a long horn or whatever that they could actually redeem those. If they sell those gift cards in the store then they can be redeemed for those. So it defines that but it also defines a lottery gift card. Let me tell you, we've been consulting the lottery oversight committee has met with the lottery commission and we've been talking to them about doing a lottery gift card. This would be a loadable card that the lottery would make money on both ends of this and this is what they've got a pilot program underway now that they've been working on for a while. I think they have their lottery gift cards at 198 locations as they're moving forward with that. So in this bill, these locations they can redeem for gift cards but on July 1st of 2022 then those gift cards go away and the lottery gift card goes into effect. This provides for own site inspection by the Georgia Lotter Commission's Co-M division within six months of operation of a new location for compliance review. This clarifies a law that receipts of a gift card is an act for an in-store redemption. It ensures the contractual rights are protected once parties are committed to an agreement. This is between the master licensees and the retailers. Late fees, the Class A and B are absolutely set in stone for what it is a late fee for a retailer or master licensee that fails to renew their licenses on time. It ensures for open market a competitive market if there is any forfeiture and this means that that license or the machines or whatever it may be, they would be subject to public auction, not a backroom auction by any individual over the lottery commission or otherwise or a holder or some of the folks that we run into situations where prior to the contract, where private attorneys are being hired by DEAs as privateers. This clarifies that it had to be a public auction of any of these assets. It sets the appellate review standard so that after the GLC clarifies and there's an appeal then it can go to the superior courts after 30 days. The 50-50 rule. Currently, in one of the things that we changed, I think it was probably in the early 2000s, was that locations could only have up to nine machines in a location. We also stated at that time that these locations, they had to have 50% of the merchandise or the gross receipts had to come from sales other than what came in off of these machines. This is what we set up based on a quarterly system. We had a car about for charitable organizations. One of the things that fell victim back 25 or so years ago, 20 to 25 years ago, was your charitable organizations, your American legions, your VFWs, your AMVets, these type of organizations because these places didn't sell merchandise so they couldn't meet the 50% rule. We have done a car about for these locations for these charitable organizations. The criteria for that is they have either got to have a Bingo license today, had been in business for 10 years and be a 501C3 organization. One of the things that we remember is that those locations and any machines that are also plugged into the lottery terminal so that the lottery can oversight what they do. This would be a big boom to those charitable organizations. The burden of proof is on the CoM division and assessing violations. Provides that existing contracts remain in place as long as they are being utilized at the facility. It reinforces the fact that inducements cannot be given or received between the master license and the retailer. Digital signage can be provided inside under limited guidelines of the CoM advisory commission. The Georgia Administrative Procedures Act would cover all rules for licensure. CoM advisory board could adopt rules and according to the Georgia Administrative Procedures Act. As I said earlier, it sets July 1st, 2022 or sooner for the creation of the lottery gift card. Addresses hearing concerns in appeal processes and says that if there is an appellate and that appellate loses a decision on the rules of all the money would go to the lottery commission. And then finally that arbitration would be clarified and after arbitration it could go to the business courts in Superior Court and Fulton County. I would submit to you ladies and gentlemen that this is a good bill. It's a long time coming. There has been, it's interesting that to me that in the real world who was going on, there are still some of the master license holders and possibly some retailers. They don't want this tighter level of scrutiny. We heard some of them, we saw a bill that was dropped in over in the Senate and to the embarrassment I understand to one of the members when they found out that that bill actually had a niche that would open up for cash payouts which would be illegal. Then it was quickly killed in the committee. We've had several of the companies we understand a couple not several but a couple of companies that have very much problem that they'd like to have a monopoly on the issuance and the contracts between the master license holder and the operators themselves. That's not correct. And last but not least, you know, there was a there was a substitute that was proposed somewhere along the way that they had been no discussions and that's about raising the fees. Right now the fees to these machines that the master license holder gets 45% of the revenue because they buy the machines. They furnish the machines and the retailer gets 45% because they provide the labor and the locations. So it's a 45 45 split. The Georgia Lottery Commission receives 10% and has absolutely no investment, no money involved. They get a 10% rake off the top. That's a pretty good that's a pretty good deal for the lottery commission because in the administrative fees they're the ones that are actually doing the regulatory procedures. And that ladies and gentlemen is what this bill does and I'd be glad to stand for some questions, Mr. Speaker. Well, you have several. Yes, sir. No doubt. There recognizes representative Carpenter to your right for a question. Yes, sir. Is the chairman you certainly is it not true that this bill will give consumers options to spend their winnings? It will. Is it also not true that this would give even more security to this industry that many people don't believe secure? I go back to what I said earlier that one of the things that we need to be absolutely certain that we have hemmed up any avenue for the paying out illegal paying out of cash by going to the gift cards. Then that gives that merchant options and that player options. And anybody quite frankly would have to be dumb as mud to pay out cash. And one final question, Patrick. Will this finally allow me to win something of value when I'm playing ski ball? Well, you can win lottery tickets or you could if you win enough points playing ski ball you could probably go to home depot and buy your cooking set. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams to your left for a question. Yes, sir. Will the chairman and the value yield?

Yes, sir. Things first, you said they'd have to be dumb as mud. Is that not true? If they get caught playing out cash or there or even enticed to do such a thing. Is it not true then? I know a lot of mud. I've seen a few muds get caught. But what I really cry as a general will further yield. Yes, sir. Are you absolutely certain that you have explained everything in this regard? Yes, Bill. I do need to wait a while longer. I've explained everything in this regard. Can I answer that for you? But if you have, but to my good friend from the coast, if you got something specific, if you'll ask it, I'll be glad to dig it out. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Sir, recognize this representative, Jasmine Clark, up in the gallery to your left for a question. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does he do them on you? Yes, ma'am. All right. So can these lottery gift cards have a visa or a master card logo affixed to them? Not that I know of. Right now, the first cards that would be eligible would be gift cards that are sold, which would be that. I'm sure there's some 20 different cards. I've seen them in the sea stores. Home Depot, Walmart, you know, longhorn cards in those cases. But they sell. But they sell. And then when the lottery gift card, when they institute that, hopefully within a year, that was what they call a legacy card that is downloaded on one end and spent on the other. And that is where the lottery would get money coming both ways. All right. Thank you. Yes, sir. No further questions. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house, I would certainly encourage you to vote for this bill. These machines are there. They raise money for the state of Georgia for the lottery. And this tightens up all of the control. And I would ask you to reject any amendments. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. Well, I'm sorry. We had two people who wanted to speak on the bill. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house. Up until about 30 minutes ago, I was planning to come to the well and ask you to vote no against this bill. But I've had some conversations with Dean Smirie and some folks that are committed to working to make this bill better in the Senate. And because of those concessions and commitments to me, I'm here to ask you to please vote yes. And let's move this bill to the Senate. This industry is an ill. It just is. It attracts things that we don't want in our communities. It's a very addictive form of gambling for lack of a better word. I know folks want to pretend like it's not gambling, but it is. If you took a heat map of gas stations in your communities that have these machines, you're going to see lots of red dots of crime. But here in this state, just like with the lottery, with co-ems, we're willing to accept the ill if we get a benefit for our citizens. And that has been thus far payments into the lottery for education fund. The co-em industry pays 10% of their earnings to the lottery for education fund. They are coming to us in this bill, House Bill 554, and asking us for a lot, particularly asking us for the ability to give a gift card, which will make those games much more enticing to the people that want to play them. So people are going to play more. They're going to make more money. It is my belief that if they are going to make more money, then we, on behalf of Georgians, need to make more money. And that percentage into the lottery for education fund needs to go up. I think it needs to go up to 20% at the very least 15%. But I have commitment to at least work on increasing it 2% over the two years following implementation of this new gift card program. And then we agree to come back and look at it. And it would be my intention at that point that we increase it a lot. But there have been conversations about how perhaps if we go too much too fast that it will lower the overall return to the lottery for education fund, which obviously is something I don't want. I think that's a good compromise, which is why I'm here today asking you to move this bill forward. But please know, if that doesn't happen in the Senate, I will be the first one up here, because why should we give away something for nothing? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the will. Do you yield for a question? I will. Chair recognizes Dean Smiré to your left for a question. Does the lady yield? Yes. You mentioned the five and ten, but you didn't mention what the what would be derived from the increase in percentage. So five percent would be somewhere around 45 million. 45 million. And 10 percent would be somewhere like 90 to 100 million, is that correct? Yes, Dean. And thank you. We all percentages are one thing. But when you put hard dollars for it, means quite another. This industry, I will just recap, $3 billion played into these machines a year, $2.1 billion taking out as winnings, $900 million for the industry, of which we got 10 percent, 90 million. So if we increase that five percent, that's another 45 million. If we increase at 10 percent, that's 90 million. $900 million, this industry made, and we made 90. Again, let's make sure we're not giving away something for nothing. I would be willing to yield for more questions if there are any, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Paris up in the gallery to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman let you yield? Yes. Do you not agree that this is a tremendous strain on communities of color? I do. And furthermore, would you further yield? Yes. That in BIP County alone in the month of August, COAM machines yielded $4.5 million. I thank you for bringing these points to our attention because it's very important. The state should be making more money on this operation. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Thank you, Representative. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Ladies yielded the will. Chair recognizes representative Dukes to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and to the members, the honorable men and women of this August body. I am a member of the caucus of the believers. You know who you are. And in that caucus, we really don't really do much gambling. But in the state of Georgia, we decided that we would accrue us on behalf of the children of the state of Georgia. I remember when they brought the lottery, I was a trustee trying to make people. And I know it's going to be difficult for me to do that supporting the lottery. But I acquiesced it because I knew the children of the Georgia needed hope. My biggest concern with this bill is that we are giving people the right. And acquiescing to gambling. And we are getting 10% of the deal. Now with the Georgia lottery, we get about 25% of the deal. So if we are going to give people an opportunity to come in this state and do that which I do have a concern with, you got to give me more money. I have to have more of a take for the two or a half of the children of the state of Georgia. 10% is grossly too low for us to give anybody the right to come in Georgia and gambling. Now I know a lot of people are in support of that. I can appreciate that. But let us not give away this right to people coming here making $90 million a year. And the children of our state are being short-tanged. Mr. Speaker, I was going to put it in the form of a question, but I know we only do two, so I had to come down and speak on it. If there is no questions, you have a question if you care to you. You speak to your honor. I'm sorry. I will be honored. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams to your left for a question.

There was a lot of questions represented Jackson and I had, but it not outside of the rules of this August chamber, I would come and lay hands on you. Well Mr. Representative, I appreciate the thought, but if somebody don't lay hands on me, I'd rather for it to be Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

There are recognizes Representative Lurikki to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I rise to present House Bill 346. And before I do, I just want to say thank you to Madam Chair Cooper and Representative Sharper and the other members of the Health and Human Services Committee. They really steered me in the right direction on this, what looks like a simple piece of legislation, but it is not. This is narrowly drafted to help individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is a rare disease that only impacts about one in 20,000. These individuals with CAH have to always be mindful that their body does not respond to inter to injury and sickness the way that ours does. Their bodies will literally go into shock with just the simplest injury. And what this bill does, it defines congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It defines the emergency medical services and that paramedics only can do this. But these individuals have to carry their medication with them every day, all day, 24 hours a day. And it's a life-saving drug. This allows paramedics, when they respond to one of these people with CAH. It allows them to give an inter-muscular shot of that saw-you-courtiff to save their life if it goes into adrenal crisis. And so, Mr. Speaker, that's simply what this bill does, is allow paramedics to administer that shot. I'd be glad to take questions if there are any. You have one question. I'll yield. Two questions. I'll yield. Chair recognizes Representative Sharper up in the gallery to your left for a question. What is it on you? Absolutely to my friend. Is it true that we work very hard on this bill and make sure we have the proper language that will make it smooth transition for the paramedics and also the patients and their families in this bill? And is it true that I 100% support this bill and wish everybody would give us their support? Thank you so much for that and thank you for your input and work on this. Do you take another question? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to your right for a question. General Yield? Yes, sir. To my friend. Is it truly to acute adrenal crisis can be fatal to an infant? Absolutely.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this resolution was passed by this body by my predecessor, the Hon. J. Craig Gordon, in the last session and due to COVID-19, this resolution along with the other two died in the Senate. These resolutions are simply to compensate individuals who spent 25 years of their life in prison for a murder that they did not commit. They were exonerated because the individual who gave the outwins testimony, recanted that testimony, as well as what's known as the Yammercrawl report, was not provided to the prosecution to not provide that evidence to the defense. And so this case has been absolved and these gentlemen have given 25 years of their life. They were veterans and now they've been left destitute.
