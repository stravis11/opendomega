TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to go ahead and call this meeting to order and the Dean of the Senate is going
to open us up in a word of prayer on number eight.
Thank you, Chairman.
And if you're about with me for a moment, Father God, we thank you for the blessings of
this day for safe travel to and from this occasion. And let us be mindful of the fact that we're
here representing all the people of Georgia and health care. Big issue not only here but throughout
America. We thank you for the many blessings of coming and going safely and things we don't
remember and think of every day. These things we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Good morning, everyone. Hope everybody had a fantastic Thanksgiving to the members
of the General Assembly. Thanks for coming back a day early to the working members of
this committee. Thank you for all the time that you have taken to help us in this endeavor
and to those people that have participated either as expert witnesses or just providing
your own experiences as well. We're extremely grateful. We're going to go over our findings
recommendations today. Before we do that I do want to thank everyone from
Senate Press to Legislative Council especially to Mackenzie in our office
for all the work that you've done getting the reports together and then
Jocelyn who worked through the weekend I think up until about 10 o'clock
last night and then again at about eight o'clock this morning getting this
report in front of all of us. I would like Jocelyn in just a minute for you to
present the recommendations to the committee. All committee members should have
received an email this morning with these recommendations.
And so hopefully you've had a chance to look those over if you
have not.
They're on page 14 of 15 in your report.
Just going to give you a state of play for the meeting this
morning.
Jocelyn's going to walk us through the recommendations.
I'm going to open the floor for any and all discussion
amongst the committee.
There was a lot of, and I'll speak a little bit more into
this when she's done, but there was a lot of synergy in the
recommendations that you all sent.
So thank you for sending those.
The recommendations were thorough.
A number of members sent in multi-page recommendations,
highlighting things that they learned through this process,
and then kind of that came to their conclusions
of those recommendations.
And what I would call the main recommendation
that you're gonna see today that we'll talk about,
nine out of 12 members responded in favor
of that main recommendation.
So we have large consensus among this board.
And there were a couple that I didn't hear from,
a couple of members that did not provide those,
which is fine, and they may be addition to the nine.
so we'll obviously see that in the discussion today.
After that discussion, we will vote on adopting
or amending the report that is before you
with the findings, and then that will conclude
our work as a committee.
So I just wanna thank everyone again
for your role in this process, and with that,
Jocelyn, I'm gonna turn it over to you
if you can walk us through the recommendations
that begin on page 14.
So, I'll just go ahead and kind of read it off.
Based upon the testimony, research presented, and information received, the study committee on Certificate of Need Reform has found that the problem which Georgia's con laws were intended to combat no longer exist.
The con process is used by market incumbents to prevent competition and deny patients the benefits they're from.
The con laws prevent the citizens of Georgia from benefiting from advances in healthcare delivery, especially in rural communities.
In accordance with these findings, the study committee recommends the Georgia's con laws should be repealed in their entirety.
Repealing Georgia's con requirements would eliminate the anti-competitive effects of and abuse practices under this law.
Most recently, South Carolina repealed its con law, the study committee members and the Senate will utilize South Carolina's model for potential legislation for the 2024 session.
Since the General Assembly is unable to enact a full repeal in the upcoming session, the
committee recommends that the Georgia General Assembly pursue the following changes to the
current con-loss.
Number one, repeal con requirements for obstetric services, neonatal intensive care birth centers
and all services related to maternal and neonatal care across the state of Georgia.
at requirements for hospital-based CON on January 1st, 2025. Reform CON laws to eliminate
CON review for new and expanded inpatient psychiatric services and beds that serve Medicaid patients
and the uninsured. Repeal all cost expenditure triggers for CON. All medical and surgery specialties
should be considered a single specialty including cardiology and general surgery. Multispecialty
centers should be allowed, particularly in rural areas,
remove con for hospital bed expansion,
revise freestanding emergency department requirements
such that they must be within 35 miles of
inaffiliated hospital and remove con requirements,
and remove con for research centers.
Great, thank you, Jocelyn.
As I mentioned earlier, nine out of you
in your recommendations to us or in conversations
directly with myself have recommended a full repeal of Georgia's con law.
And that's really the high level recommendation here.
The secondary recommendations, because we recognize that may or may not be achievable.
If that is not achievable, we thought that it was worthwhile to go ahead and dive a little
deeper and make some specific recommendations on ways that we can enhance and improve
the current statute.
The first recommendation here, as it relates to repelling requirements for OBS, NEO-NATLE-ICU's,
BIRS centers, and all services related to maternal and neonatal care, that came from me.
That was the only recommendation that came exclusively from me, and even that recommendation
is kind of bundling together pieces of different recommendations from members of this committee.
The last three on here, number 7 through 9, were from one member of the committee, but
numbers two through six were all from multiple members of the committee.
So I think for me having the benefit of reading through all of these recommendations, what
was very interesting, instructive, and encouraging was that unless you all were colluding in some
capacity that I was completely unaware of and discussing this, and I'm sure that you
were discussing, however, in the extensive recommendations that you all sent, there
is definite consistency around the recommendations
that are in this report, and that is why,
and how they made their way into this report.
With that, I would like to open the floor
to any discussion and commentary from members of the committee.
If you wanna unpack any of your recommendations,
if you wanna unpack some of the thoughts
that you put into your recommendations to us
as it relates to the overarching recommendation
of a complete repeal, I think it would be beneficial
to have that on the record.
And so with that, if any of you have any comments
that you would like to make, I'd be happy to recognize you.
Chairman Watson, are you reaching for number five there?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have not had a chance to look at this
and it's relatively new, so I want to make sure
I'm reading exactly what it says
and the purpose of it, obviously,
to look at a very important issue for the CON issue
that has been back and forth over many, many years.
And my inclination is after listening
to doctors and Columbus and Savannah and all
of the places we've gone in organizations and hospitals.
It seems to me that there's something
that needs to be done as it relates to the rigidity of it.
Perhaps as a word, I'm looking for maybe to the,
it may be too rigid to deal with current operational situation
as it relates to people who want, who can offer the service
but are not being allowed because of the restriction
of CON.
So I don't want to just jump off and say,
I'm supporting a complete lifting of it,
but I'm open to, based on some information I've heard,
as I said from around the state to look at some things
that we can do to deal with the current,
the ability of people to, in that medical field,
to deliver services that they're capable of
and provide that valuable service
for the people of state of Georgia.
Great, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I hope that you are able to digest these in this meeting,
and then also I hope that other members of the committee
to maybe shed light on or offer their own commentary
on recommendations one through nine
because I believe that these recommendations
can accomplish exactly what you're talking about.
Chairman Watson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the meetings that we've had
and I think very informative for all of us.
I wanna mention one letter that Dr. Beatty
wanted to make sure that we included
And I have not had a chance to look through the final version here,
but it probably is included, but I wanted to bring special emphasis
to his letter from Augusta.
In review of that, just the clarification,
I think maybe we'll need some clarification on line nine
when it talks about research centers.
And we talked about that ahead of time.
Does that mean those that see patients,
don't see patients that which may be what that alludes to and or are we talking about
teaching hospitals and so forth and then that's number nine and then in number on number
five and six are we talking about ambulatory surgery centers is that what we're talking
about when it's just centers I just you know I'm not a lawyer but we do pass legislation
and definitions many times makes a difference so just want to make sure we're clear what
we're talking about.
Mr. Baker, I remember incorrectly that you were the one
that highlighted Mark, were you the one that highlighted
the research center piece, were there research centers
in the state that do not see patients, do not accept
insurance, there are strictly doing research
that were denied acts that were told by DCH
that they needed to file a CON for a PET scan machine.
And so the intention of number nine is to capture that
and just hopefully clean up that language
such that DCH is clear.
I don't think that that's an extensive broad brush across the existing, I think it's probably just a capture, what we probably would all say is the true intent of the law.
I think that was just overreaching.
So I mean, to be clear, so these are research centers that are doing research and need a CT scan or PET scan or something like that.
And they were having to go through the CON process and obviously that was not the intent of it.
it and DCH is ruled that apparently and so that's that's a clarification there okay that makes sense
sure thank you great and then to answer your question about five and six yes we're speaking to the
SCs there
Dr. Wordon are you on 11? Yes okay you're recognized
First, I just have one point of clarification, number four, which is repeal all cost expenditures
that would apply to L&R rules too since that's under CON.
Correct.
A previous draft of this had that in for hospitals, but the current recommendation, I think
the spirit of what the recommendations were from the committee was for that to be a broad
elimination of the expenditure thresholds.
And I would just like to say that, you know, I've really enjoyed listening to all the
testimony and having approached this in the past purely from a point of a private practice
physician.
It's been very interesting to me to listen to the testimony about the hospitals and all
of these other areas and reading the things about which I was not as familiar.
And I would agree that repeal certainly seems to be the most logical and conclusion that
I could draw, but certainly these recommendations would address a lot of the access problems
that happen in rural areas and the ability of physicians to deliver care in the appropriate
setting.
So I want to thank you for the opportunity to participate.
Thank you, Dr.
Any other commentary from the rest of the committee?
Chairman Harrison, would you like a few minutes to continue to review?
I see your reading over there.
I want to make sure you have time to digest this before I call for a vote.
Number four that someone just dealt with that one and they looked at that one. I thought that number six
Absolutely number six. I think that's something that we've all been trying to deal with
Now, I'm not so sure about the ramification number five, all medical and surgery specialists
should be considered a single, especially including cardiology and general surgery realm.
I'm not sure a medical person gives me some idea of how that.
Sure.
That was part of a recommendation from Dr. Watson, so I'm going to go ahead and let him unpack
that a little bit for us.
Or do you think that I should have a better data worth on?
Yes.
So I think that there's been a lot of controversy
and changes in the rules of what is a medical special.
Like orthopedic surgery could have a surgery center.
Cardiology has been, are they considered
a single specialty for L&R rules,
or if the pedics had some overlap with physiatry.
So this would say that cardiology is a specialty,
GI is a specialty, psychiatry is a specialty,
internal medicine is a specialty.
I don't know what they would use as a center
of each specialty would have the ability
to do a L&R center.
In part of that had to do with what,
the definition of general surgery was,
whether or not they were a single specialty
and that was having to do with the Eleanor Rose.
So if you were in your internist,
but you're not certified as a cardiologist,
but you practice cardiology
and have the license to do those procedures,
you would be able to be as a cardiologist.
Chair Lee, your Patrick.
Yeah, just to either clear that up
make it more confusing. I'm a hand surgeon and you can be a hand surgeon if you're an orthopedic
surgeon, a plastic surgeon or a general surgeon. And so we specifically put an exception in the CON
in the L&R law for hand surgery. And I think also for physiatry because there's so much overlap
between the specialties. So that's, I think this would help clear that up.
Any other commentary from the committee?
All right. With that, I'd like to entertain a motion on the totality of the findings.
And then we will take a vote.
Motion to adopt the report, Mr. Sherman.
We have a motion to adopt the report and the findings.
Do we have a second, Mr. Baker, all those in favor of the motion or any discussion?
All those in favor of the motion, please signify by raising your hand.
Got one, two, three, four, five, six.
All those opposed like sign, see one.
and carries six to one.
I'm going to recognize Jollison.
We didn't have all the members present voting.
We need to have all the members voting on the report.
Okay.
There's no abstention.
Okay.
Did you have a vote, Mr. Chairman?
Okay.
What?
You can't abstain from voting.
I'm going to refer to Council on that.
Okay. You need to vote Mr. Chairman. Okay. So that moves then if my account is correct
6 to 3. Is that okay. Motion carries 6 to 3. I'm going to recall the vote. All those
in favor of the motion is presented please signify by raising your hand. I see
these six years, all those opposed like sign.
And I see two, you're correct.
Six to two, correct.
I've voted to break a tie, which we do not have.
Motion carries.
Once again, wanna echo my thanks to this committee members,
all those who worked hard in support of this committee.
You are our honorary members and to all of those that
travel with us around the state and offered your input.
It was very valuable and helped us get to the conclusions
that we got to use to thank you all.
And with that, this meeting, this committee, our adjourn.
