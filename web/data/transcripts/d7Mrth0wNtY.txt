Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. The time for
Gavini has arrived. The Senate will come to order at this time. I will ask all
unauthorized personnel to exit the chamber. I recognize the senator from the 28th.
Good morning, Mr. Right. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good to see you today.
And it's a sad day here in the Georgia State Senate, for today we don't have any pages.
And so rather than introduce pages, I'm going to shame all y'all by reading some fun facts
in this day in history.
So on this day in 1776 Thomas Payne published Common Sense, a 50 page pamphlet calling
for a war of independence that would become the American Revolution.
On this day in 1946, United States Army Signal Corps successfully conducts Project Diana,
which was what you ask, bouncing radio waves off the moon and receiving the reflected signals.
In 1984, the United States and the Vatican established diplomatic relations after a 117-year break.
And in better news, in 2012, Nathan Dill was inaugurated as the 82nd Governor of Georgia.
Now, today is a beautiful day.
It is National Save the Eagles Day.
bittersweet chocolate day. It's National House Plant Appreciation Day, National
Oysters Rockefeller Day, and it's National Take the Stairs Day. So Senate
colleagues, if you don't want me to read that every single morning for the next
36-7 days, I would encourage you to promote the page program back home and let's

Thank you and be seated.
It's my pleasure to date introduce a personal friend of mine I've known for over 20 years
instead of giving you all the good stuff that I know about him I will read the formal introduction
of Mr. Doug Sherrill.
Doug was born and raised in Wayneville, North Carolina.
His father served in the Vietnam War and became a successful businessman in the fiber
optics industry, leading Doug's family across the country all the way from Texas to Massachusetts.
immersion in many different communities along with his southern Baptist raising shaped
Doug's view of our country from an early age. As Doug entered high school he was appointed
to the Boy Scout or the Boy State Model legislature program and quickly became one of the most
successful debaters in public speakers in the state of Texas. He went on to attend the
Louisiana Baptist University and the University of North Georgia where he earned his bachelor's
degree in political science and business followed by his master's degree in
public administration. He continued his work at North Georgia for the past four
years as a lecturer. Doug served as youth pastor as ordained minister prior to
moving to DeLonica, Georgia, where he began a successful business as a land
surveyor. Doug has generously served the Lumpkin County community as Lumpkin
County surveyor and later Lumpkin County's commissioner. He is also a
graduate of Leadership Lumpkin. He is a graduate of Republican Leadership of
Georgia and he serves on numerous boards and charitable organizations in the
community. Through his many contributions to our community, he remains a go-to
contact for other leaders across both Lumpkin County and the entire state of
Georgia. Doug and his wife Laurie have been married for 25 years. They have four
children and the remain active in the ministry at the Lighthouse Baptist Church
and Dawsonville, Georgia.
Senators, please welcome Reverend Doug Cheryl
and lend your ears and your heart to his words
as he comes to us today.
Thank you to my Senator Gooch.
I appreciate the kind words.
I was thinking that Senate Bill 1, this session,
I didn't get to lobby my Senator,
but would be to declare that the Georgia Bulldogs
were number one in the country.
I did notice in my invitation to speak today that it said no singing and so I wasn't sure
if that was because someone had heard me sing before or if Senator Gooch did not want
competition.
I want to read from God's Word today out of the book of Ecclesiastes.
I spoke last year about the motto for the state of Georgia and I want to hone in if you
will allow me just a few moments on the word wisdom.
Solomon said this beginning in verse 13 of Ecclesiastes 9.
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun and it seemed great into me.
There was a little city and few men within it, and there came a great king against it and
besieged it and built a great bulwarks against it.
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city.
Yet no man remembered that same poor man.
Then I said, wisdom is better than strength.
Nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom was despised and his words are not heard.
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rule of among fools.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroyeth much good.
The Bible here tells us that there are four qualities to this poor wise man.
But we often think that wisdom comes in the form of great leadership among the rich,
the wealthy, the known, and yet Solomon said who had more riches than we can imagine.
He said, I saw something incredible in my life.
I saw a poor man with wisdom who saved his community, perceptive poverty.
wisdom in unexpected places. Solomon said, we need to find these unexpected places and
may I encourage you today as our leaders in this great state find wisdom in the unexpected
places. Wisdom is not often found amongst our peers but among outside arenas. We find
wisdom in children. They have great stories to tell us and often they can cause us to
to stop and pause and consider a moment.
They're the senior citizens who have lived and seen the history,
and may we not forget to incline our ear.
There's the struggles and challenges
that we all face in life that can teach us
and build wisdom as we lead.
The great poets of old found great wisdom
by simply sitting outside and observing nature.
looked at the mountains, they saw the animals
at how they would commune.
We need to stop and pause and seek wisdom.
Everyday observations as you walk through the halls
of this great capital,
may you find the wisdom
that this poor wise man found.
Number two, he had prudent planning.
It's obvious that in a small city, this poor man
was able to overcome apparently a king
who had formed a great army to besiege the city
and in his wisdom he was able to overcome and protect the town.
How in the world was this possible?
How did he make this happen?
I could give some maybe an illustration
of a plausible outcome of what he did,
Despite the city's limited resources,
maybe he ingeniously devised a plan
to divert and ration the water,
creating a façade of scarcity.
This cunning strategy fooled the advancing army,
led by the king into believing
that capturing the city would yield little spoils.
Be wise as you lead.
Be wise as you legislate.
Be prudent in your planning.
Place the importance of strategic thinking
and planning upon our actions.
Number three, he had a powerful preservation.
In verse number 17, it says the words of wise men
are heard in quiet more than the cry of him
that rule with among fools.
Sometimes we find, or more often than not,
we find great wisdom in the quiet moments.
Not in the boisterous sounds, not in being loud,
but in the quiet moments.
It's often the individual that speaks the least
that so many folks say, hey, he may have something
important to share and something to say.
So this poor man employed diplomatic skills
and in spite of what the world says about wealth,
about strength, Solomon said wisdom is better than strength.
Wisdom defeated the army.
And verse number 17, wisdom is better than weapons of war, a praiseworthy perspective.
You know the saddest part of the story in my eyes and my view is that this poor man was
forgotten.
His wisdom, what he did was forgotten.
We all seek to attain a certain level in society.
We appreciate a name.
We appreciate an obligation or being called today is such an honor for me to even be here
and speak today.
But here was a poor man that saved his city and no one remembers it.
The Bible over and over says there arose a generation that knew not Joshua, that knew
not Moses, that knew not Joseph.
Now often we forget those in the past who have done so much for our present.
The greatest example I can provide you of the poor man who was wise is Jesus Christ himself.
For the Bible says in him are he had all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
The Bible says he became poor that through his poverty we might be made rich.
And yet so often we forget the one who is wisest above all.
As I think about each of you and what you embark upon this year, I truly do pray for you
and pray for this session that God would grant you true wisdom.
We need good leadership in this state and I pray that God would grant each and every one
of you, the wisdom it takes to lead and to legislate. Let's pray.
Gracious and eternal God, as we stand before you, we are humbled by the wisdom found in
unexpected places, much like the poor wise man of ecclesiastes. We seek your guidance
for our journey of leadership in acknowledging that true wisdom comes from you alone. Grant
Grant us, O Lord, the humility to recognize that leadership is not about status or wealth,
but about serving others with a heart filled with compassion.
May we, like the poor wise, man, find strength in simplicity and richness in humility.
Lord, teach us the strategic planning that comes from seeking your guidance.
Help us to navigate the complexities of leadership with prudence seeking solutions
that bring peace, justice, and unity.
In times of doubt, remind us that wisdom is a gift from you.
In our pursuit of it, may we bring glory to your name, may our leadership reflect the
values of your kingdom, justice, mercy, and love.
Lord, we lift up our responsibilities, decisions, and the people we lead into your hands.
May your wisdom be our guide, may our leadership be a testament to your grace and goodness.
May God bless the great state of Georgia, in Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
Amen.

If I can have everyone's attention real quick, everyone's attention.
We always like to recognize our doctors of the day and it's an honor to have our friendly
face here.
We've seen him hit down here many times and he's a guest of the Senator from the 16th
here and I'll call him the Senator from the 16th to introduce the doctor of the day.
Good morning, or afternoon, have to remember where we're meeting as far as that.
Dr. Chris Walsh is one of our own down in Fayette County.
He is an orthopedic surgeon with the resurgence orthopedics and specializes in hand and elbow,
but he assured me that he could handle anything else that breaks our needs fixing while he's here.
So that's a good thing.
He received his medical degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
and completed his residency with Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
He serves on the board of the Georgia Orthopedic Society and its past president of the Georgia Society of ambulatory surgical centers
and serves on the Physicians Performance Enhancement Committee at Piedmont Fayette Hospital.
Dr. Walsh served as a U.S. Navy Reserve and was an active duty baton surgeon
of the Second Marine Division, where he was deployed to Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
So that was a long time ago, but still a very major time we thank him for his service in the military,
but also thank him for his service here with us. Thank you.
I always appreciate coming down and enjoy the opportunity for a change of pace and to
see how you all do your work here.
So thanks for having me.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.

We have a special guest here today.
It is honored to have the Deputy Administrator, United States Small Business Administrator

Senator from the fifth will introduce him and and we're glad to have him here
and and I want to treat him treat him well because we love our small business
and everybody associated with it so Senator thank you mr. President good
Good afternoon, friends and colleagues.
I'm honored to welcome my friend, Deputy Administrator of the United States Small Business
Administration, Delua Said, to the Georgia Senate.
Prior to his appointment to SBA, he worked at the State Department where he championed
American businesses as special representative for commercial and business affairs.
As the State Department's top commercial diplomat, Deputy Administrator Saeed advocated
for U.S. companies to compete and win a broad and help ensure U.S. competitiveness in
market across the globe.
Before joining the Biden administration, Saeed was CEO and Lumietta, the AI healthcare
company focused on reducing healthcare cost and improving patient's outcome.
The lower side has driven civic effort at the federal state and local level, focusing
on economic growth and entrepreneurship.
As the founding chair of the California Entrepreneurship Tax Force with the Governor's Office of Business
and Economic Development, Saeed promoted inclusive entrepreneurship, his serve on prison
Obama's White House Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander A.P.I.'s and chaired
the White House initiative on A.P.I.'s economic growth committee. In that role, SAID laid
the administration engagement with small business across the United States after the passage
of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In 2020, SAID was stepped by the
San Jose California mayor Sam Ricardo to help lead Silicon Valley's
pandemic economic recovery as a member of the Silicon Valley recovery
roundtable. Said holds an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania and unBA in economics and computer science at the University of
Texas in Austin. The most importantly he was confirmed by parties with the
by partisanship at the United States Senate.
Please give him a warm Senate welcome to my friend,
Deloitte Heed.
Thank you so much, Senator Maun, for your very kind invitation.
Thank you so much, Governor Jones, for having me here
and the leadership.
And it's an absolute honor to be speaking to you
in this August house.
I'm here to talk about small businesses
and entrepreneurship.
that I can say safely, everybody loves our small businesses.
And we'll share with you what the SBA is doing
that I have this so much privilege to help lead.
Now we know that Georgia is one of the top places
to do business in the United States.
I have done as an entrepreneur in a business person.
I've done business in Georgia,
I've done business in with folks in Atlanta.
And I can test to you personally that we know what's
happening here is not only helping you in the country,
frankly, it's helping change the world.
Now, these are extraordinary times in our country.
We are recovering from a pandemic.
We see recovery, but not too long ago.
So many in our communities were affected,
especially small businesses.
Climate change, you know what that is doing
in many communities across our state and nation.
And of course, geopolitical challenges
from the Middle East and Ukraine.
The President has responded to this moment
with an incredibly vigorous agenda.
In 2022, we passed, for most part, bipartisan legislation
that is helping us build industries of the future.
EVs, batteries, semiconductors.
I can tell you, somebody who spent 20 years in Silicon Valley,
we stopped doing semiconductor advanced manufacturing
in this country a long time back.
That is starting to come back.
And to share with you stats that I'm sure you know,
here in Georgia, $37 billion of investments
is coming into advancement and manufacturing right here
to this great state, in part because it's bipartisan
historic legislation.
$9.6 billion in infrastructure spend
that's going to improve our roads and bridges in Georgia
improving our airports.
A couple of projects that I think are phenomenal.
Hyundai, $5.4 billion investment in the state.
We saw the governor.
I know you joined him when they opened the plan here.
Q-cells, which is going to soon be producing solar panels.
And I was struck when I read this fact about Q-cells.
Once fully operationalized, they will be responsible
for almost 40% of all of the solar panel production
in the country.
That's huge.
So when you have operations of this scale take place,
here is what takes place as well.
Small businesses start to expand in those communities
because you need new services, new small British owners
to serve those communities, to serve those businesses.
I also know from my tech roots, a new class of startups
emerge that you need to plug into these new value chains.
And that's precisely what's happening
across the country, because these investments,
we have seen a record number of small businesses
founded in the last three years of this President's
administration, 16.1 million Americans
have founded a business in the last three years.
In the state of Georgia, roughly 760,000
Georgians have started a business.
Now, as someone who has started many businesses
and scaled others as well, I know that starting a business
is the first step, but you need a lot of support, resources,
funding to grow a business, to create jobs,
and that's where SBA comes in.
And I'm going to spend just a couple of minutes
talk about what are we doing at the SBA to support these 750,000 plus
Georgians who just started their business in the last three years. One of
our core priorities of the SBA is to democratize access to capital. We want to
make sure that entrepreneurs who are in rural Georgia, who are an underserved
community, have also access to the SBA funding. So number one, over the last
Last couple of years, we have made permanent 143 mission-driven lenders.
These are CDFI's, these are community banks, regional banks that operate in rural communities.
We learned one interesting thing from the pandemic.
It wasn't the big banks that were available to our underserved communities for funding.
We had to invest in, we had to make sure the smaller banks were SBA banks so they can
actually mobilized capital into these communities.
Second, we are cutting red tape to make sure
that smaller loans are being made available.
You've seen a decline in small dollar lending
year over year and it's gone on across administration.
We have made the process simpler and easier
so more smaller loans can be made available.
And finally, something to share with you,
which I found it surprising when we did this.
For the first time in 41 years,
Since President Reagan's administration, we lifted a cap on the number of what we call
small business lending companies.
These are non-depositive institutions that are operating the country.
We're only 14 of them.
So now we have more of them coming and one of them is a FinTech called Funding Circle.
So no matter where you are in Georgia or where I'm in the country, in fact, you can go
and apply for an SBA back loan because it is enabled with FinTech.
I shared a lot of things, I shared a lot of numbers, but one thing that I want to underscore,
these policy reforms, these rules that we have done, a lot of with the statutory authority
that's given to us by the United States Congress, and the SBA have taken a lot of intentionality
about equity, about making sure that the taxpayer-funded resources are available to all Americans
in every region, in every part of our country.
And we have seen those results.
Last year, I spent $54 billion in funding.
$1.4 billion of funding for small businesses
here in the state of Georgia.
One, another thing I want to mention very quickly,
federal government contracts.
The United States government is the single largest purchase
that of goods and services in the world.
$650 billion.
That's bigger than the GDP of many countries.
And the economic output of many states.
We want to make sure that small businesses have
to have a big share of that.
That's something that President has called out.
In fact, he went a step further and said
that we want to make sure that 15% of that figure
goes to minority owned, women owned businesses,
rural businesses.
And that commitment he made when he visited Tulsa, Oklahoma.
at a very solemn time to observe the 100-year anniversary of the burning down of the Black
Wall Street.
He stood there on those grounds and he said, it's very important that this great resource
that our country produces a good amount of that goes to those who have been held back.
So with that, let me say, as we go into this new year, it's an exciting time with what's
happening in our country.
Last quarter, we saw 5.2% GDP growth.
Inflation, we are managing it.
Many states, gas is now below $3 of the share.
The most important as small businesses
are back researching after the pandemic.
They need a help federal, state, local.
I love the focus the governor has on small business
and entrepreneurship here.
Looking forward to partnering with all of you
to make sure that we do everything in our power
to have the backs of these new small business owners.
Thank you for having me.
That's an order.
Are there any unanimous concerns?
Chair, here's none.
Does any senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege?
I got your center. Hold on. Boy, you won't come to the floor.
Parliamentary inquiry then. I'm sorry.
You agree, Mr. President? Yes.
Mr. President, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 6th for business outside the Capitol.
All right. That objection to the senator from the 7th or 6th. 6th, excuse.
I thought you had something important there, Senator.
You scared me up here, so I recognize Senator from the 53rd on a point of personal privilege.
Mr. President, day back home I got a constituent, used to be a senator and back
when he was a senator he used to say he had friends for a bill and he had
friends against it but he was with his friends and I hope my opinion on a piece of
legislation is never that ambivalent but I say that to say that I've got a
piece of legislation that I've never been more confident and convicted about
There's a copy of it on each and every one of your desks this morning and I sent an email out last night
It's called the Stop Political Persecution's Act and I believe it's the first line of accountability
unto the district attorney of Fulton County
If you would be so kind to sign on I think you'll certainly be a friend of our Constitution
It would be a friend of Liberty and I've got it back at my desk and lots of pins for you to sign on. Thank you, Mr. President
Thank you senator. Does any of the senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?
You have before you consent calendar of privilege resolutions, does any senator wish to remove
resolution from the consent calendar. His objections to adoption of the
resolutions on the consent calendar. Chair here is none and the resolutions on
the consent calendar are adopted.
Are there any motions to withdraw or commit?
I recognize the senator from the 51st and majority leader.
Thank you, Mr. President.
