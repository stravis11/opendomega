TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're very excited and appreciative of the Governor, the Speaker of Lieutenant Governor
of Passing, really the first piece of tort reform or lawsuit abuse reform.
And it put in perspective with me the other day when I realized it was 20 years ago this
year that the Georgia Chamber worked with Governor Perdue to pass the first round of tort
reform in Georgia.
And it's been 20 years of work every day with our members and with the General Assembly.
And so, you know, our hope here is that we see a reduction in some of the frivolous lawsuits
that we see some insurers return to Georgia that have left, that we see some stabilization
of rates, and it may be most importantly, we can actually see some of our rural hospitals
improve their ability to attract doctors, particularly OB-GYNs, into some of the parts
of the state that really just haven't been able to keep those physicians in place.
And so big bill, 69 is still out there, some other bills that are still in that space,
but the governor's Senate Bill 68 was a huge win, a huge step.
Let's talk about 20 years.
What happened in that space, that tour reform space, over 20 years?
So what happened primarily was in those first five or six years after that, the court system
overturned a lot of those findings that the General Assembly passed.
And the General Assembly, for whatever reason, we didn't come back and fix them when the
courts pointed out that there were flaws and out there.
And so between that, and then a lot of new calls of actions being passed at the same time,
the business community suffered through that, we made our points, but it wasn't until
about three years ago that we decided that we really needed to engage differently.
The governor was very engaged, he wanted to, you know, he's traveled the state this year
to listening to businesses and doctors and everyone
to really hear what those issues were
and then he came out with his two bills in January.
And you had some heavy hitters, you had Waffle House,
you had Uber, you had those big executives involved.
You had those executives, but I think what was more important
is if you look at that first press conference
the governor held and you look behind him.
I look behind him, I didn't see all the CEOs up there.
When I saw, we're hardworking Georgians
in their home depot aprons, in their waffle house aprons,
in their hard hats, in their lab coats.
They said, this matters to me and my family,
and I wanna be here.
And we heard, I mean, every community that I toured
in the last three months, we heard from small business
owners with their stories, just,
we heard from doctors saying they were shutting down
their practices because their physicians
were moving to North Carolina.
I mean, we heard those horror stores everywhere we went.
So this wasn't just about the grass tops.
This was the grass roots.
Every day, hardworking George and saying,
and we need to see a change.
Do you worry about lawsuits like you had 20 years ago?
Of course, and I think what we'll do this time
is we'll go in and we'll battle those out
and we'll try to preserve what Governor Kemp said
was important, what our members say is important.
And we'll be much more vigilant
than our predecessors were 20 years ago.
Let's talk a little about insurance reform.
So that is something that people are saying
that's next year.
What are your feelings about that?
So I think we have to, first of all,
we need to make sure that these changes
that go into 68 and 69 have chance to work.
What we've saw in Texas, what we saw in Florida
is that those rates did come down.
In Texas, they saw Med Mall rates go down 54%.
Took two years, but they saw them go in.
So, listen, last year, I consider what the governor
passed last year was insurance form when insurers
had to provide all that data to John King.
We trust Commissioner King with what recommendations
he might come back with as he looks at that data.
And so we'll be part of those discussions,
but I think we've gotta let,
I think we'll see more insurers come back to the market
because of what we've passed this year.
And the more competition in that market,
the lower the rates are gonna be.
If you only got two or three companies
that are riding, you know,
trucking, underriding for trucking companies,
they're gonna set their own price.
If you got 20 coming in,
it's a much more competitive market.
And so that's what our hope is
that we'll see some immediately stabilization
and then we'll work with the commissioner
and others next year.
So you'll see some companies
who want to come into Georgia,
Stay in Georgia because they think insurance will stabilize at least if if nothing is right it hopefully
They don't we don't see the frivolous lawsuits
We don't see the nuclear verdicts at the same level. We've closed some of those loopholes and our hope is the insurance
We've talked to so we want to be in Georgia. We want to underwrite in Georgia
Just not a feasible for us right now. Okay. Let's change gears a little bit and talk about your strategic plan Georgia
2050 what is that so in January after almost two years of traveling the state listening to
our members listening to legislators, elected leaders at the local level. We
unveiled Georgia 2050. And it's a it's a bold 25-year outlook for the state's
economy. So it's more than just our strategic plan. It's really a strategy for
the state's economy. And what we heard from business leaders that we weren't
just thinking four or five years out that they were making investments for
20, 25 years. And you think about it this way. We were at Hyundai's Meta Plant
Grand Opening announcement last week with the governor. They were very clear.
This is not a short-term investment.
We're going to be here for the next 100 years.
To fix the interstate going into Savannah is a 20-year project
to build two new nuclear reactors is a 20-year project.
To deepen the port of Savannah is almost a 20-year project.
And so we felt it was important to look long-term.
So this plan looks at the data, how Georgia's growing,
where it's growing, what the business is going to look like,
what the disruptions are going to be.
And Donnet focused on five kind of core pillars, as we call them.
making sure we've got the right workforce and talent in place, making sure those young men and
women can AI proof their careers is what our big concern is. Number two to make sure that we've
got the energy production in place and the infrastructure investments that we need,
to make sure that we're focused on growing the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs
in the state, that we remain a competitive and vibrant location for economic development,
and at the end of the day that we have regional prosperity and healthy community,
So that every community in Georgia has the chance to grow and we've got the right health care supported systems in place to help them do that.
And so every policy, every event, every program, every bill at the Capitol that we work on falls under one of those five pillars.
First of all, let's talk about where are we now if we don't make some changes.
I think there are two things we need to look at.
Number one is we have to get men and women that are disconnected from the workforce today back in.
If everybody that wanted to work could find a job and have the skills, we'd be at full employment.
employment. That's what we have bills like Senate Bill 207 on Occupational
Licensure Reform coming from Senator Strickland to make it easier for men and
women that have been incarcerated to get the license they need to go into the
workforce. And so that's part of what we got to work on. The other part is
looking at Generation Alpha, which are our elementary, our middle school kids
right now, to make sure they've got the skillsets they need to be
horrible 20 years from now when they get out of college. And that they've got
The right skills in place is AI disrupts their first choice career and their second choice
career.
So there's a lot of work that's got to go on in that space.
We have a couple of bills that the governor supported this year, best place for talent
being one of those.
And so we've got to have those types of policies, but I also think we've got to be much bolder.
The fact that my son's a freshman at UGA right now, go dogs.
He graduated with much the same class schedule that I had 30 something years ago.
And that's not going to work in a system where kids need more real-world experience, more
technology experience, more humanities.
We're going to have to really rethink K-12, I think, in the long term.
What were the bills that dealt with AI that you were looking at this session?
So I think there's a lot of concerns.
We didn't have any specific bills, there are lots of bills that kind of floated out there
on data privacy and artificial intelligence, and I think our concern has been, and it
will continue to be.
companies online transcend states, they transcend countries. And if every state has its own
artificial intelligence bill and its own data privacy bill, all of a sudden your company,
my company, everyone else, we've got 50 different states that we've got to watch their
laws for. And so we think that's a national solution that tells us what the parameters are
for ethical AI and for ethical data privacy and that we're punishing the bad actors and
not the main street mom and pop companies that get hacked even though they did everything
they were supposed to do.
And so that's been a lot of our education at the Capitol this year is helping legislators
understand this is a very big issue, it's a national issue and let's make sure that
if we do pass bills, they look like a bill that North Carolina passed or Alabama passed
so that we're all on the same page.
Well, almost a sunny day, what are you looking for in the next few days?
So we still need to pass a couple of bills in tort reform like the governor of Senate
bill 69 needs to move out of the Senate or the out of the House. That deals with third
party and foreign litigation to make sure that people aren't abusing our legal system
from Russia or from China or from London for that matter. And then we've got a couple
of more bills on tax that we want to get out, but I think those will all move easily.
And quite frankly, this part of the year you play a little bit of defense to make sure
that something that has unintended consequences doesn't undermine what you've been working
I've got to ask some of the cutbacks at the federal level, especially grants, are already
hitting some of the business community in Georgia.
So what are you hearing from your members and what are you saying to them?
So a lot of our members are worried about what the impact of tariffs are going to be.
They're worried about cuts, particularly in research and development.
We have a lot of research universities in Georgia.
We've spent out a lot of companies from those.
So we're now part of a national coalition that's looking at how you fund science, research
and development to make sure that we're telling the right story and we're getting those
dollars that are available back into our universities and into our state.
You know, I've heard from the president of Morehouse and Emory about the potential impacts
there.
So we're just trying to be a good advocate, make sure that our members of Congress understand
where those dollars go, the impact that they have, and the fact that they're spinning
off companies every single day in Georgia.
and that's the great work of the Georgia Research Alliance.
So we're trying to advocate and be a good partner there.
And then obviously on tariffs, we're just trying to work
with our partners all over the country, all over the world
and make sure that Georgia businesses know what they need to do
in order to be compliant and to mitigate
or to lessen the impact of any of those tariffs
and continue to talk to our friends in Washington every day
about the potential impact.
