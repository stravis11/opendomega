Where is the justice of our nation in the courage?

Dr. Ott lives in Walsh, Georgia with his wife, Kathy,
and remains deeply committed to strengthening churches,
leaders, and communities across our state.
Please join me in welcoming our pastor of the day,
Dr. Reverend Kinney-Eye.
Good morning.
Members of the Senate, thank you for this privilege
of being here today, and I want to say thank you
especially to Senator Jason Dickerson
for the invitation.
And I want to say thank you to all of you for what you do.
I know what you do is a hard job.
And we appreciate that you work on behalf of us
who live here in the state of Georgia.
As you all well know, there is real weight
that comes with being a public servant.
The decisions made in this chamber help shape lives,
and they help form our communities,
and they determine the future of our state.
And with that responsibility comes complexity
and pressure and moments when the right path, as you know, is not always immediately clear.
Because this type of responsibility carries weight, it also requires resolve and experience,
but more important than that, at least in my opinion, I believe it requires wisdom.
The Scriptures speak directly to this in a way that serves us well.
James 1 and 5 promises us that if any of us, like wisdom, let them ask God who gives
generously to all without reproach and it will be given to them. One of the wisest
people I ever met was my paternal grandfather. We called him Papa Watt. His name
was William Robert Ott and he embodied this promise more than anybody that I've
ever met. Papa did not have the opportunity to finish high school because of
circumstances in his life. He was a truck driver, he was not a public servant,
and he never claimed to have all the answers.
But where I grew up, he was the steady wisdom
that people who knew him trusted.
One of the things that Papa taught me
and something that I have never forgotten
was that wisdom is not about having all the answers.
It's about knowing when and where to go find those answers.
And as I've grown and as I've watched other leaders
carry this real weight of responsibility,
I can affirm that pop always right.
Wisdom is not having all the answers,
but knowing when and where to go find them.
And James 1, 5 affirms that for us.
It begins with a very freeing assumption that I think
that we should all embrace if any of us lack wisdom.
Not as a criticism, but as a reality.
Because there are times when we just have to struggle
to find the right answer.
Leadership often places people in situations
where experience and expertise
and good intentions alone are just not enough.
Wisdom is more than information, it's discernment.
The ability to see clearly
to weigh competing positions into act with integrity
when outcomes are uncertain.
James invites leaders to ask God for this wisdom,
trusting God's character who gives generously
without reproach.
This reminds us that God does not shame us
or look down on us when we are uncertain about things
or when we are indecisive.
In fact, God welcomes that honest dependence.
For Christians, that wisdom is not abstract
towards an ethereal.
We believe God's wisdom is made present
through the Holy Spirit, that presence in our life,
God in our conscience, sharpening our discernment,
and studying our hearts when we're under that pressure.
The Holy Spirit does not de-force decisions upon us, but it clarifies matters most when voices
are loud and that weight of responsibility is heavy.
So in a culture that often rewards certainty and punishes hesitation, this scripture offers
a very different vision of leadership.
One where humility is strength, and asking for wisdom is actually an act of courage.
And so my hope today is not that I would tell you what decisions to make, that's certainly
not my position, but that you might be encouraged about how to carry that responsibility that's
been entrusted to you.
With humility, with openness, and with willingness to seek wisdom beyond yourselves for the sake
of those people that you serve.
Would you please pray with me.
of wisdom and mercy we give thanks for these men and women who carry the responsibility
of public service.
I pray, O Lord, that you grant wisdom generously without reproach and that you would let your
Holy Spirit guide their hearts and their minds with clarity, humility and discernment.
Where decisions are complex, I pray, O Lord, that you would bring clarity.
Where that pressure is heavy, I pray that you would give them peace and steadiness.
And where there is disagreement that you would bring respect and peace.
God may all serve in this place, do so with integrity, compassion, and care for the common
good.
We trust in your presence and guide us in Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.

It is always a pleasure to have the
and to introduce the good man who came here to volunteer his time for us today as
our senator from the 41st. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning
colleagues. It's my honor here to present to you all. I'm reintroduced for some
Dr. Steven Holbrooke. He is an EMS doc who does emergency medicine. What's
really a meaningful to my community in particular was that he helped open up
a pill-and-dell hospital that serves a lot of my constituents
in the Cab County, make sure that EMS works.
And most fondly to my heart, he has served as the medical
director for EMS programs, both at Emory and now at Georgia Tech
for students, which is where I learned all of my EMT skills.
I worked at Emory EMS, and so really grateful for him
continuing that work to expand opportunities for students
early on to get engaged with emergency medicine
and grateful for all he does to save the lives of Georgians.
With that, I will turn it over to Dr. Holbrooke.
All right.
Thank you.
It's good to be back here again.
Appreciate all the work that you guys do.
Do remember the EMS and the emergency room folks
because all of us end up using them at some point in time.
Really do appreciate all the work you do.
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.
All right.
Good job, Doc.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Are there any missed concerns?
Does any Senator wish rise on the point of personal privilege?
Recognize the Senator from 17th for the point of personal privilege.
Thank you very much Mr. President, colleagues I rise today to recognize two persons, both
are relatives, one Mrs. Emily Stenson, who is the mother of Reverend Dr. Michael Stenson,
We probably remember a couple years ago, he was our chaplain of the day.
She was a graduate of Spellman College, a member of Africa, Africa, Africa,
fraternity, a sorority incorporated.
She was an educator here in the City of Atlanta for over 30 years.
And a member of Warren United Methodist Church.
The second one is also a family member, Miss Brenda Hambrich Shaw,
is a relative and also a constituent down in Stockbridge.
She was a graduate of Fort Valley State University,
and she was an educator there in Hinder County
for over 30 years.
Mrs. Nesson celebration of life will be today,
and Mrs. Shaw in here in Atlanta,
and Mrs. Shaw on tomorrow.
But today I joined with other judges
and remembering them and celebrating their wonderful life
and all that they did for their community
and certainly for the children of the state of Georgia.
Thank you very much, Mr. President, I yield the will.
Thank you, Senator.
Our condolences go out to the family.
We're gonna send it from the 44th
for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I just wanted to call everyone's attention to the Georgia Partnership for Excellence
in Education's annual top 10 issues to watch in education that is on your desks.
They really do tremendous work, very detailed policy base helping us formulate excellent
policy around public education and moving our schools forward, ensuring that everyone
has, every Georgian has the opportunity to thrive from early childhood ed all the way
through secondary.
In particular this year, they've highlighted issue five is the student attendance issues
that we've really been grappling with, particularly ever since the pandemic.
And another big topic in this one that I wholeheartedly agree with is the need to use data
to drive more of our decision-making than we have
historically done.
And this, they believe, the partnership believes
that this is particularly important in light
of Governor Kim's announcement yesterday
of the $325 million that we are wanting
to move into needs-based higher-ed funding.
So in light of that announcement,
It is a great time to, across the board,
try to consider this session moving policy forward
in concert with where the data shows investment is needed
to achieve the results that we want to achieve.
So please take a look at it.
Thank you so much, Mr. President.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Senator.
We're gonna have Senator from 34th.
affordance.
Committed in the
promoting excellence and fostering unity.
Today, we proudly honor that vision rooted in
enduring principles of scholarship, service,
sisterhood, and finer womanhood.
As we celebrate our 106 year of service and sisterhood,
and unite in our global day of service,
we pause to reflect on just how far we've come.
We stand firm in the legacy built by those who pave the way.
We are caring for the promise to advocate for change, uplift communities,
and strengthen the families across the globe.
Today, I just want to say, happy Founder's Day to the women of Zayda Phi Beta Sorority Incorporated.
Thank you.
All right, thank you Senator.
Recognize the senator from the 38th, 4-pointed person privilege.
Yeah, figure this mic out, huh?
It's new.
Like so many of you, so many Georgians and folks in here,
I'm heartbroken over the killing of Renee.
We're getting Renee Nicole good.
My thoughts are with her family and her children.
This is a loss of life that did not have to happen,
but what happened to Renee has sent shock waves
throughout our country and even here in our state
and has actually driven people further and further apart.
I want to make it clear.
I strongly disagree with the policies
that led to the loss of Renee's life.
But just because I disagree with those policies,
doesn't mean I have to hate the people who voted for them.
That's why I'm standing here today to ask you, my colleagues,
to take up the mantle of bipartisanship
so we can move past situations like these.
As we start this new session, this week has shown us
that we can come together and be above
the partisan politics that has so entrenched our nation
and our state in the past.
We're in a heavy moment for our state and our country.
People are angry, fearful, and hurting.
In times like this, we have a choice.
We can add to detention, or we can lead with calm,
compassion, and purpose.
Georgians aren't asking us for us to fight each other.
They're asking for us to focus on what matters
matters most.
Affordability, healthcare access, housing costs,
the literacy crisis, take your pick.
As we start this session, I'm calling on all of us
to set a new tone that reflects the best of Georgia,
steady, thoughtful, and committed leadership
to healing and not dividing.
So in the spirit of bipartisanship colleagues,
I'm asking that we stand for a moment of silence
in honor of Renee's life and to honor her family
at this time.
Senators ask for one stand and
recognize moment of silence.
Thank you colleagues.
Thank you Mr. President.
I yield a well.
Thanks Senator.
Bring it out of the center from the 50th.
We're appointed personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today just simply to acknowledge three of my favorite constituents that I brought
with me today, Halley, Hazel, and Heidi.
Their younger sister Hope is still at home.
Her birthday is on Monday, but we decided to let them have an excuse absence from school
today and come down and help me work.
If y'all see them, please say hello.
Halle, Hazel, and Heidi, can y'all wait for us?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I yield the will.
Yes, good looking bunch of kids, good looking bunch of little ladies right there.
You go have a hard time in about 10 years, Senator.
Oh, times are coming. You won't look so young.
Recognize sir from 35th.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Also, thank you to new colleagues and those that have
of a press my button for me so well, two days in a row.
I figured this time, and I figured this time,
I'll be excited to take you up on that.
So I come here to just express deep sincere gratitude
for this body.
Deep sincere gratitude for elected officials.
I'm a follower of Jesus who has a deep regard for authority
for government, and I know that we live in a world that defines that in so many different
ways.
I believe in our systems, I believe in our institutions, but I also come here with an
approach about loving God and loving people for real.
And the idea of defining our, well, challenging our definition of who our neighbor is.
And the moment I step in this chamber, every single one of you helped me to expand my
definition of who my neighbor is.
I come here representing the grandparents in South Fulton, the children in Southwest Atlanta,
the business owners in Northwest Atlanta.
My patients at Invinings in Cobb County and those in Smurna, Smurna, Georgia.
And when you welcome me the way that you have, you welcome all of them.
And so I thank you for not only expanding my view of who my neighbor is, but I pray
that I can do my best part to help expand yours.
So I look forward to not just a session that we can get through, but having the most
fruitful, fruitful session that we've ever had.
Georgia has an opportunity to continue leading,
not just in our business, but also in our tone.
And I'm again deeply thankful for all of you.
I yield the will.
Well, well, well.
That was good, that was nice, Senator.
That's very kind, Senator, it's very good, and we enjoy having you as a new member here
in this body.
You're going to be a good member for this body, but we're still going to haze you when
you come bring your first bill into the whale.
So it's so good to have you, though, Senator, Senator, he's a good man.
All right, any more points of personal privilege?
You have a consent calendar of privilege resolutions as any senator wishes to remove the resolution from the consent calendar.
His objection is option of the resolution of the consent calendar.
Chair here is done and the resolution on the consent calendar is adopted.
adopted. Are there any motions that would draw or commit? It is now time to reconsider
the confirmation of the appointments to the judicial qualifications commission. I recognize
the senator from the 31st and majority later. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent
that one roll call vote. Senator, I'm sorry. He's got to read the resolution. I'm sorry.
I apologize.
So, Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Assignments has had under consideration the following
appointment, Mr. Judicial Qualifications Commission, the Honorable Alison T.
Burleson appointed by the Supreme Court, Mr. Andrew J. Welch III appointed by the President
of the Senate, the Honorable Brian Amorickman appointed by the Supreme Court, and has instructed
me to report the same back to the Senate with the following recommended that the appointments
be confirmed as submitted respectfully submitted, the Honorable Bert Jones Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, please be ordered.
Thank you, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that one roll call vote
suffice for the confirmation of the appointments to the Judicial Qualifications Commission.
Here's the objections to the motion.
Senator from 50 fields of jax, would you just general with speak of your objection?
Come on down.
With all due respect, Mr. President, I come simply to state that it would be the
the process of confirming these names.
I have no problem with not one of them on here.
I have a problem with rubber stamping as we are so to do.
It would be good for me if I get a resume or really
get some understanding as to who we are putting on these boards.
And as I understand it, we basically are allowing these persons to serve
before they even, we get to do it, to get to confirm them.
It would be very fruitful for me personally as a senator to really understand
what we are confirming rather than in the rubber stamp.
That's the simple jest of it.
If I can have some resumes, if I can have some more information,
if I can even quote unquote do a very terrible thing called
diversify these boards, it would really be in the best interest of Georgia
so that people can know what we're voting on and what we're confirming.
And with that, Mr. Presiding Officer, I yield the well.
I simply say that I'm concerned about the process
to rub us down without really knowing what we're doing.
Thank you.
So the motion was the majority of leaders asking
for unanimous consent that one roll call vote be suffice
for the confirmation of appointments
of the Digital Qualification Commission.
Yes, sir, Senator from 55th.
Mr. President, I remove my objection.
Thank you.
All right, thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. President, I move that the appointment to the Judicial Qualifications Commission
be confirmed as submitted.
The majority leader has moved that the appointments to the Judicial Qualifications Commission confirmed
is submitted. Does any other senator wish to speak to the motion? Is the objection to
the motion? We'll put it on the board. Okay, so we are going to vote as a body on this
and we're going to put it on the board so without objection we'll move, all that we'll move.
So all those in favor of the majority of leaders' motion will vote yeh, all those opposed
nay, Secretary of Law and Machine.
You
