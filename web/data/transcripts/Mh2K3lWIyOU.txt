----------
all right well what good afternoon everybody welcome back thank goodness it'll
be day 40 before we know it just want to wish everybody a happy new year want to
thank Georgia DOT GM State Patrol our line crews first responders and
everybody else they responded to the storm we appreciate them and certainly
I appreciate the members of the General Assembly for supporting what they do every day out
there in this dangerous world.
Also honored to have the greatest First Lady in the country, Marty Kemp, with us and
Shaperoning and supervising her today is the First Lady of the House, Dale Burns.
We appreciate y'all being with us, appreciate Lieutenant Governor Burke Jones, Speaker of
the House, John Burns, and especially want to thank Budget Chairman Blake Tillery, Senator
Blake Tillery, and Representative Matt Hatchett for being with us today.
And certainly all these legislative leaders that are behind us.
We appreciate you all's partner so much.
We have together made incredible progress in our classrooms.
Since 2019, we have raised public school teacher pay by nearly $10,000.
We have restored the promise of the hope scholarship.
We have provided $230 million to our higher education system to eliminate the special institution
fee to help keep the college affordable for our scholars.
We've invested roughly $20 million to help our paraprofessionals take that next step in
in their career to become a teacher,
we have increased the number of counselors in our schools.
And with this year's budget,
we have fully funded our schools
now for five years in a row.
All told, we have committed an additional $3.7 billion
in ongoing funding,
just since I took office in K through 12 education.
That's more than any other governor
in any other General Assembly in state history.
And it ensures our students and teachers have the resources for a quality education.
Today with the support of the people you see here, stand in shoulder to shoulder.
I'm proud to say that this year we will build on those investments by fully funding our
our classrooms and adding an additional $10.3 million
for local schools for pupil transportation.
As many school districts have experienced growth
over the last several years,
this new funding will ensure they can transport students
to school without having to cut into other parts
of their budgets.
I'm grateful to the leaders up here with me
that they have agreed to this infusion
that will directly affect our local communities.
But we also know that a quality education
requires a safe learning environment.
That's why we work together to strengthen campus security
for every school in the state.
Just since I took office,
we have provided more than $185 million
in one-time school security grants,
which equal to roughly $80,000 per school.
And after the conversations with school superintendents
and leaders across the state,
This past session, we took a strong step
to make these school security grants a permanent part
of the budget.
Every year, each school will receive over $47,000
to spend on security related infrastructure or staffing.
As all of us remember, the horrific tragedy last year
put these investments to test.
And had those supports for school security not been made,
That fateful day in October could have been even more tragic.
With that in mind, I'm proposing an additional $50 million
in one-time school security grants,
which will bring the total grant amount
for the current fiscal year to over $86,000 per school
for a total of $158 million statewide this year
that we will spend on school security.
We will also be looking into how we can best improve the student to school psychologist
ratio and provide funding for crisis counseling training further building on the progress
we've made in prior budgets on this issue.
All of these investments were planned with the goal of making our schools even safer,
mental health support for our students, teachers, and faculty, and developing the best and brightest
minds right here in Georgia. Again, I want to thank the men and women you see here with us for
their support across multiple years now for these measures. As we have said before, I know we
can and will deliver on these measures for our students and hard work in Georgia families.
With that, I'll turn it over to one of our key partners, our Lieutenant Governor, Bert
Johns.
Good afternoon, thank you, Governor Camp, thank you so much, thank you, First Lady Kim
for being here today.
It's great to be here with the speaker of the House, speaker of John Burns.
You can't say much more than what the Governor just said.
The two years ago, we started talking about our school
systems being a very vulnerable place for our kids
being educated and where we needed to beef up
and security and things of that and invest more
in our school systems.
We did that then and had it not been for the investments
that we had made, as the governor said.
The tragedy that did hit Appalachia a year ago
could have been much, much worse.
And we're gonna continue, this is gonna be an ongoing effort.
We're all three chambers, the executive branch,
as long as the House and the Senate
are always gonna continue to work on building on
what the governor has put forth here in the last year
and what we're going to, you know,
certify in both the House and the Senate this upcoming year.
I wanna talk about another measure
that we're gonna be pushing in the Senate.
We did it last year with a list of laws that is a mandate
on school door securities measures
that we passed out of the Senate last year.
That it came up short last year in the House,
but I do feel like that after having a year of educating
our friends over in the House as well as the speaker
on that measure that it will be successful
this upcoming year.
So I don't want to take any more of the speakers time here,
but I will just say that I want to thank Governor Kim
and his leadership as well as Speaker Burns
and the working coalition that we've had as a group
and trying to make sure that our kids are safe
and our kids have a very secure place to go to school
and live and learn every day.
So thank you, Governor Kim, again.
Thank you, members of the House and Senate
and Speaker Burns.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Governor Jones, you're right.
I do need some time because our chaplain of the day this morning, the house said he had
about a two-hour message, but he thought he could get it done in 45 minutes and he stayed
on that plan.
So it is, I don't have quite that much, but you'll know what I know.
It's always a great day to be a Georgian and the day is as well.
You know, it's also great to be back here
under this bright and shiny golden governor.
Thanks for sharing that goal with us
and making sure it's beautiful again.
This 2025 legislative session is with Governor Camp,
Lieutenant Governor Jones,
and all of our members in the House and Senate,
we're ready to go.
We're ready to get to the people's work.
That's where we are and we've been,
we've talked a lot about it
and now we're ready to get to work.
We talk a lot about in the House about education,
where this increasing pre-K funding, early literacy,
initiatives, teacher pay raises, or school safety.
And we're proud of the work we've done
to create incredible educational opportunities
for Georgia students.
We're certainly going to continue building
on our successes, as the governor said.
But this year, following those devastating tragedies,
we witnessed at Appalachia High School,
I made it clear to the House that we would leave
no stone unturned when it comes
ensuring that our students can learn in a safe and secure environment.
First, I am proud to fully support Governor Camp working with Lieutenant
Governor to provide an additional $50 million in the amended fiscal year 2025
budget for one-time school safety grants. This funding combined with our
prior investments in school safety will make a significant improvement and
and significant investment in every public school in our state
for school safety upgrades, improvements, infrastructure,
and personnel.
Where the school needs additional security cameras,
buildings, safety infrastructure, or alert systems,
or resource offices, these grants will provide the flexibility
and discretion needed to fit the unique needs of every school
and every corner of our state.
Next, the House is going to continue discussion
around school safety cameras.
And put forth measures to require any revenue generated
from school zone cameras and fractions
to be designated for school safety.
The intended purpose of these cameras
is to keep our students safe as they travel to and from school
each day.
And it just makes good common sense
that the revenue generated from their uses
to just that, keep our children, teachers, and schools safe.
Next, we'll take steps to address our students
access to mental health care.
We know that mental health care continues
to be a growing concern among our young people.
That's why I'm proud to join with Governor Kim
in increasing funding to improve our student-to-school
psychologist's ratio.
There's no question, y'all,
that the pressures of adolescents are becoming increasingly difficult for our children.
And ensuring that they have access to mental health resources and care is critical to their
safety and well-being.
Finally, we know there was a significant breakdown in communication between school districts,
law enforcement, agencies, and other agencies leading up to the tragedy at Appalachia High School.
The House will take action to require our schools,
participation in a statewide information sharing
and gathering network assessment model.
This model will aim to provide school officials
and law enforcement agencies with the information
they need to keep our schools, our students safe
while maintaining the highest possible
of privacy standards for students and families.
Our children are our future.
They are the future of our state, and our educational system is the foundation of their success.
The House looks forward to working alongside my friend Lieutenant Governor Jones, our colleagues
in the Senate, and Governor Kemp to ensure the success of K-12 education here in the
great state of Georgia.
Thank you, Governor Kemp.
Well, thank you, Speaker Burns, Lieutenant Governor Jones.
With that, we'll open it up for questions, and I know both of these guys moved way off
to the side, but they're willing to answer your questions as am I.
Well, I will just commend the members of the General Assembly when we did this first.
I mean, I campaigned on this issue in 2018 with complete local control.
We did grants.
I believe it was in my first big budget.
And the General Assembly went along with that when we did the second round.
We changed up who was, you know, kind of how the money would be distributed.
know, it was still going to the local school systems. They had complete local control because
look, they know their schools and their campuses better than we do. I, you know, for myself,
I don't want to speak for the legislators here, but you know, I think the local school boards,
the superintendents working with their local law enforcement, they know what their individual
campuses need. What I have heard is that we still have a few systems out there that
maybe haven't been able to put a certain kind of security system that would help their
campus others had been using the money for personnel so in talking with the
legislative leadership we kind of felt like let's do one more round of one
time funding so there will be no excuse for any system in the state to have you
know what they need and then you still got the continuation funding that
these legislators and and or the folks that were here last year put in the
continuation budget of the funding formula so that's gonna keep going next
year in the year after that. But this will help people that haven't been able to do something
with one-time money, hopefully be able to finish that out. And we'll see what they want to do.
I mean, you're going to have some systems that, you know, want to put additional hardware.
As somebody mentioned earlier, you'll have some of them that want to go with, you know,
a campus-wide security, maybe more cameras, you know, communications and every classroom,
whatever it is. I mean, we're, we just want the money to go and support those kind of things.
and then certainly the legislature will be digging into that as we go through the budget process
to and working with the local systems. I will say that the system we have in place everybody
early on had to have a security plan for their district before they could get the money to make
sure we knew what they were going to spend that money on. We weren't dictating what they should
spend it on. We just want to know they had a detailed plan to do that so they're getting a good
mind for for the buck and the tax payer can rest assured that this is going to
keep our kids and our teachers and our school system staff safe well I would
I'll just say this from the Apex program,
you know, also campaigned on that,
funded that, my first budget, that money still in there.
The problem is finding these professionals is very, very hard.
That's something our state's been working on
just to continue to find more of these counselors
and other people in our classrooms.
So I'm open to all of the above.
I mean, look, if you think about what we've done
on mental health in this state,
the General Assembly last year
and the budgets we propose, we're spending more money now
on mental health than we ever have in the history,
in the history of our state,
and we'll continue to do that.
I would rest assured with the budgets
that I'll be proposing anyway,
and I'm sure the legislature is very supportive of that as well.
Well, listen, we'll work with the general assembly on any issues that they have. I mean,
nobody's come to me precession and talked about those kind of issues, but we're starting
ready to work with people, but our main issue right here is making sure that we're helping
our schools with this additional funding of $50 million added to what we have in the
base budget last year can keep their schools safe.
And I think we saw how well the system that Appalachia had worked, even though that was
a tragic day.
It could have been more tragic if we had not had that funding for that school system.
there to think what would have happened.
All right, thank you all for being here.
Looking forward to a great session.
Thank you very much.
