----------
you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you של beautiful you Queens knows 在 хл this is the subcommittee investigating the We're reminded everyone our primary focus is looking at the different components involved in operating the jail, whether it be the county commission, the sheriff's office, the prosecutorial group or the judiciary. So we're going to move forward with that this morning. But before we do that, I'm going to ask Senator Chuck Paine if he'd be so kind open this meeting with a prayer. Yes, what is prayer? And we Father, we thank you so much for this day, Lord. We thank you for every gift that you give to us, the breath of life. Lord, we just ask you to lead us and guide us in all that we do this morning and all throughout this day. First in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Chairman. To be clear, I received a few messages last night wanting to confirm that we were having a meeting at 7 a.m. and I want to tell you, for the thousands of Georgians who are watching this meeting this morning, as they're getting ready for work, they will greatly appreciate it as they're standing around the water cooler with their co-workers, talking about how fascinating it was. And I say all that very facetiously, I'm sure you understand. But our days here in the Senate start early. Myself and Chairman Alvers are usually the first two in the building and we seem to always be chasing the tails of our responsibilities throughout the day. So starting early I think is important and it's been our habit throughout our time here whether it's a study committee or any other committee I chaired that we try to get it started as early as possible in the morning. And it's also the nature of the profession that we're all in whether we're law enforcement officers or prosecutors, judges or the men and women that work in the jail. The gentleman who led us into this building this morning had worked here all night. So it's just the nature of the profession of public safety and I appreciate the response of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office when we reached out to them and invited them to come in and explain their role in moving individuals into and out of the Fulton County jail. And so with that I would ask the Fulton County District Attorney's Office please introduce the three individuals that are here today and then we'll get rolling forth with our inquiry. All right, first of all, good morning. Chairman Robertson, thank you for having us here today and Chairman Alpers, also Senators Halpern Strickland who I guess will be joining us later pain and at this time. Thank you for giving us this opportunity to speak with you and answer any questions we can to enlighten the public, the lighten this committee as to our role with the jail and criminal justice in this area. My name is George Jenkins, I'm an executive deputy at the District Attorney's Office. I'm the head of the trial division to my left is good morning. Thank you guys for allowing us the opportunity to speak. My name is Kenneth Hutcherson, I'm an executive district attorney with the district attorney's office. I had the case intake division and to my right is Thomas White, good morning y'all. I'm deputy district attorney. I had the non complex which is the property and drug crime division. This is real quickness to why you say non complex. That's what we determined to get. Okay. All right. To start with and understand Mr. Jenkins, you'll be the primary or is it just kind of a unified thing? Yes, it is. I think to start with, if you could give us kind of the DNA of the district attorney's office as far as a number of employees, the difference between ADA's, investigators, things of that nature so the committee can understand exactly what the makeup is. Thank you. Well first of all, thank you. And that's a very good question. Obviously, we are the full and county DA's office, the Land of Judicial Circuit and so we are the largest and busiest circuit in the state of Georgia. We approximately do, I would say anywhere from 7 to 10,000 felony cases per year. And so we have a staff that's fairly large, the largest office in the state. I believe we have about at this point in time it fluctuates but between 365 and 380 employees that's broken down in terms of attorneys, investigators, victim advocates and legal assistants and then we certainly have our outreach program and employees as well as federal grants and such. Our office is divided essentially right under Madam DA, essentially the four different divisions. The divisions are our major crimes division, our trial division, our case intake division and our special victims unit division. Myself, I'm many, you know, my colleague Michael Carlson, he is the executive of our major crimes and Dacia Young is the executive for our SBD and so as you can gather from those names, major crimes gangs, homicides, our white color division, our appellate unit, those types of units from the major case, trial division, I have the complex and non-complex division which basically accounts for about 75% of the cases that are actually in volume that fooling county sees. Then you have your SBD unit which is our human trafficking, sexual assault, child exploitation unit and those type of charges and then we certainly have our federal grants or media divisions and so that's essentially the main focus of our office. We certainly have an investigation division so each one of our divisions has a chief. Mr. Jenkins, I want to be clear now. You said there were four divisions. Of course there are. Okay, major trial, intake and special victims, etc. What is the intake? You did the other three, I was just curious what the intake division is. No, I'm sorry. No, no, we call it the old one. And I want to be clear, we have this room for 120 minutes. Okay. It's the room for two hours and so we are not in a rush at all. And so as we walk through this, as having conversations back and forth, it's just yeah. So we are two hours, it should be plenty of time. Not a problem. All right, executive over the case and take division talk. Good morning. Thank you guys again. The case intake division is where the cases are initiated upon arrest, immediately after arrest within 72 hours the defendant is brought before a judge and informed of his charges and possibly receive a bond depending on the charges. What we do is we take the cases from there and our job is to gather all of the evidence that's involved in that particular case prior to that case being indicted. So once the case is indicted, it is essentially trial ready at that point. Our division so far this year, there's been over 600 felony arrests already in Fulton County. Probably per year it's about 11,000, almost 12,000 cases felony arrests per year. And that doesn't include cases that are transferred up to us from the state court where the person is initially arrested on a misdemeanor. And after their investigation they determine that the case should be transferred to us. Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Jenkins. Yes. Back to you. You said there were four divisions, you explained three of them and then one that I thought might be a little important to the initial part of the process. Well, starting process of how cases come to our office and the process of the criminal justice. And as you can imagine, we have about 55 municipalities here in Fulton County. And the 365 to 380 employees are divided amongst the four divisions plus, summer, and I guess more umbrella admin positions that kind of are touched by all four divisions. Would that be right? That would be correct. Like maybe administrative staff, research, things of that nature. Correct. With the primary investigations, take place in the intake from the intake division. They would. And the initial investigation will take place, of course, as you get ready for actual trial. More investigation is going to be required on the more serious cases. Okay. Now that we understand the divisions within the office, what's the overall budget, annual budget of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office? Do you have one of those numbers to be honest? And listen, estimates are fine. There's no, but nobody's under oath here. Right. So, if you don't know it, I mean, you don't have a clue, that's understandable. I know there's a budget meeting today. So, that's the point. That's the year. It's not the 10 o'clock. So, if you all could get those numbers and these all come over to us, I would greatly appreciate that. And looking at the budget, I would assume that you'll receive tax dollars from Fulton County. And you'll receive tax dollars from the federal government to a certain extent. And you'll receive tax dollars from the state government. That would be correct. So, if we could get the numbers of the overall budget and just percentages that you'll receive from there. And when I say the federal government, I think primarily what we're looking at are grants and things of that nature. And with that being said, do you all have a grant writer within the Fulton County District Attorney's Office? Or do you do it? Good. Yes, sir. What number you'll? Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, thank you again for being here. Understanding also from a budgetary perspective based on the size of the circuit in Atlanta for how we appropriate, how many judges are in that circuit also then comes down to as an example, my understanding if you could help educate the committee is if another judge was added, so does an ADA position, another budget to go with that in order to add to the ability to prosecute in the Judicate cases. Is that accurate? That is correct. First of all, Senator Albers, thank you for bringing that up. We certainly use more of everything, to be honest with you. But absolutely, there are just 20 judges in Fulton County with 15 that specialize, but handle criminal dockets. And so it would help to alleviate some of the pressure and some of the, I guess, volume of cases that we would increase the number of judges, certainly correspondingly we would need and we good for us to have more prosecutors from the state certainly. And so we can effectively prosecute matters. And let me give you an example. I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I was a prosecutor, a felony prosecutor in Cleveland, Kyle County before I got here in05. And so the county in terms of population is similarly yoked as well as the amount of felony cases that we deal with. And as an example, even in 2005, when I first got here, the court size, the criminal bench in Cleveland has 34 judges. And so you have about 1.2 million people that live in the county. I think maybe 4.5 or 5 million people that come in and out daily, they may not live here but do business. Unfortunately, some of them do crime here. And so that gives you an example of what the gap is in connection with a similarly busy jurisdiction that I know specifically and I've been here almost 20 years now. And so we definitely would, in my opinion, in my experience.

would need more judges and prosecutors and correspondently more of the defenders as well. One follow-up question if I could. Yes. And in looking at recent numbers, as you are referencing from the size of the circuit, this is the largest in the state by far. But there isn't anything close to it to be honest. Thank you. All right, gentlemen. The school is arrested by the Atlanta Police Department on felony brought into the Fulton County jail and booked in. Where does the DA's office come in and walk us through that process? All right. First of all, thank you for that question as well. Essentially, he will be waiting for his first appearance as Deputy White indicated in connection with our non-complex and complex. We have a representative there. So that court will on six days a week here in Fulton County that is essentially money through Saturday. And which there is a- How long has that court run six days? Has this been a long policy? As long as you can remember? Since I've been here, I've been here before. Is this a morning court or a afternoon? It is a morning court. It starts late morning and goes until it's complete. Okay. Thank you. What happens is is that depending on what the type of arrest it was, whether it was warrantless or whether they're with warrant. And so a defendant arrested for a felony that didn't have a warrant in Fulton County has 48 hours to be present to receive. Notice of his charges, the probable cause surrounding that charge. And deal with bond depending on the type of charge it is here in the state of Georgia. If it's arrested with a warrant and then you have 72 hours to have that first appearance hearing. And so they see a magistrate with a defense attorney. There is a pretrial, what I mean by pretrial, pretrial services has, what they do a background check on the person that was arrested to see if they're a meanable two bond. There's a magistrate in the form of them or the charges, their rights and a defense attorney is a problem. So, real quick, Mr. Engage, you're saying the, I'm arrested on a Thursday. Let's say, and I go to the preliminary hearing on a warrantless charge on Saturday, preliminary hearing, if you will. Proble cause hearing is, is, is, if we move to that point yet, it's, it's the first, first, first, all stages of probable cause. It's not, it's not preliminary hearing quite yet. Okay. Kidmitment here. So, who does the, who's doing the, the background check? Because the background check is to see if I'm eligible for a bond. Correct. There's a noun. Is that a GCIC, NCIC? Type of situation. The situation. The situation services, even when it would be more specific. Yes. So, so it's, it's basically a computer check. Well, there's an individual doing, yes, a background computer check. Right. Because you actually check on the history, the criminal history of that. Right. This is, this is an individual within the agency that has the clearance of the Georgia Bureau of Investigations to run criminal history checks on everyone who has audited annually to make sure they're not doing their own research business outside of the scope of their job. Certainly. And also through, so, and the point I'm trying to get to is we're not sending individuals out in the community to interview people in this other kind of stuff. What we're basically doing is running criminal history, seeing what's in there and occasionally get a head on an outstanding one or something like that that may have gotten lost or misplaced on the front end. And that and their criminal history, that means that they currently on probation. Correct. That type of thing. Correct. And so, you'll see that. They'll give a report to the court. They'll give a report to the defense attorney and certainly a representative from our office in ADA that is present for that hearing. Now, long time ago pre-COVID, there was an actually ADA at the jail. This actually took place in the courtrooms at the jail of rule-in-accountment. But since COVID, it's now done via Zoom, which is, I guess, some of the technological benefits of the pandemic that we deal with. So that's, I guess, positive, but no. There used to be this happened at the physical jail and it also happens for Mr. Meaders and State Court as well. Within the courtroom at the jail? There are three courtrooms at the jail. Right. And so, when you had an ADA at the jail, you had to have judges on the bench at the jail? Absolutely. And were these judges? Were they permanently assigned there or was there a rotating schedule? Of course. It depended, independently, years, but there's a rotating schedule of match-street judges. Yeah. So, but then the point I'm trying to get to is these aren't full-time running courtrooms at the jail where judges would be assigned to... Will judges not from superior court? No. Right. Certainly they have jurisdiction there, but they would... Oh, should they be there? Right. Right. And to be clear, we're just talking about felonies. Correct. Right. Right now. And I do understand that occasionally there'll be a case that hits the solicitor's office that, you know, we know DUI as a Mr. Meader in Georgia unless you get three. Right. And then it becomes a felony and in some of those cases they would be transferred over to the district attorney's office. And then possibly some assault cases once the facts are looked at could go from a Mr. Meader to a felony and based on information that maybe the officer fell to realize at the time that he or she thought they were making a Mr. Meader case. Correct. But for the most part, to be clear, all you all do are felony cases. Absolutely. Okay. You do. All right. Feel free to go ahead. You got us in the flow. Oh, no. You ask us. Now post-COVID, we're doing all this via Zoom. Via Zoom. Yes, sir. And so after that and so they will be in the defendant out and inform the defendant the charges, the probable cause for holding them is the person that did it and, you know, was a crime committed. And then bond will be addressed at that time. How does the individual, do they have accessibility to the public defender's office at that time? They do. They're as representative there or a private attorney if they're able to contact, you know, that attorney to meet them at the jail. In y'all's experience, what percentage of the individuals sitting inside the Fulton County jail have private attorneys as opposed to public defenders? That's interesting. And I think the legal term for that is guesstimate, is what it is. Would you say a majority or would you say a majority or minority? No, we have the number. At first appearance. Yes, sir. Less than 1% are represented by private attorneys. By the time we get to preliminary hearings, I can only talk about orca preliminary hearings. Not all of them, but by the time we get to preliminary hearings, that increases to a little less than 10% are represented by private attorneys at preliminary hearings. That's a yes. That's a fairly shocking statistic as we say it aloud. Perhaps one of the things that we could do and maybe some of our friends at PAC and other groups could help us look at what does that look like across other circuits and states and VA's offices because for a 1 to 10% that does seem oddly low to me. Maybe I'm missing something. Thank you. Well, and I think one of the things is, first of all, attorney access sometimes is an issue, but then the financial constraints that come with hiring a private attorney. Private defense attorneys are not inexpensive and as opposed to civil attorneys or civil attorneys draw their, they get the cream once the case is over and they've won, these defense attorneys, they need their money up front. These are small business owners and they can't afford to wait till a criminal case has gone through the system before they're paid. It brings to light something that Chairman Albers and I have discussed in the past and we discussed prior to COVID is that our public defender's office is a vital part of this. Many times we find these who, as good of an attorney as anywhere, but sometimes the compensation in the private sector is much greater than what they're being paid is being public defenders. We all know some good public defenders that come up there and handle a lot of cases and sometimes I'm a little concerned about caseloads when it comes to, if they're able to put the effort into each individual case that they have. Now, there's the public defenders that they have an office at the jail or do they come in like, well, they used to be there and they used to have an office. They still may have an office at first appearance or in the jail, but they are as deeply part of the process as the state is. So in the Zoom process, is the public defender involved in the Zoom process also? Are they with the defendant or is it a defendant on a Zoom? The PDs on a Zoom and then the DAs on a Zoom. And the judge is on a Zoom. And it's my understanding that the public defenders will meet with those clients prior to getting on the Zoom and inform them of what's about to happen in person. They'll meet with them at the jail. And in the real world, and everybody knows this, I watch Drag Nat, Adam and 12, and Barney Miller, only three cop shows on TV that are even close to being real. But a lot of times public defender goes in there, they may have six defendants that they're representing. And these meetings they have, when they're not whiteboard meetings, where they're looking at DNA and scientific evidence, they're basically saying, give me the circumstances of your arrest. Basically, and I mean, it's a quick conversation to where they can go in there and hopefully convince the judge to set a reasonable bond and get the person out so then they can further the conversation and get deeper into the case in order to help have the case adjudicated. Is that, is that correct? That's correct. That's correct. Thank you. Okay, so we're having our Zoom meetings. We've got the public defenders and everybody involved. And then, all right, and then, charges will be read. And this is the reason why you're arrested. This is what we're accusing you of at this time. And then a bond will be set or not set depending on what they're charged with. Yeah. Okay, and if the bond is set or not set in the individual, it's not leaving the jail. They either can't afford to or it's such a crime that the judge is not comfortable with setting a bond. What happens? What's the next piece within your agency? You want to answer that? Sure. Yeah. After first appearance. Which one can you pull that mic a little toward you? I'm a whole lot older than I look. Thank you. Objection. Objection. Objection. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I am as old as I look. There we are. I have no comment on that. Thank you, Chairman. What we, what happens is the court has a schedule where every case, no matter where the bond is set or not, is scheduled for a preliminary hearing 15 days after first appearance. If the person bonds out, then obviously the preliminary hearing is waived in Fulton County, even if there is a bond set, but the defendant does not make the bond, the preliminary hearing still happens. And so, would you explain what happens at the preliminary hearing? The preliminary hearing is the first time that a magistrate judge takes a hard look at the warrants and makes a probable cause determination. At the preliminary hearing, the state calls witnesses. Most often it's the officer. Occasionally it will be the victim. Sometimes it will be civilian witnesses. The defense counsel, the defendant through counsel usually also has the opportunity to call witnesses. And at that point, the charges are either dismissed or bound over to the Superior Court. What level of evidence is required at that hearing to have the case bound over? It's just probable cause. Just probable cause. Basically, basically, basically makes a claim. It's lower than preponderance. Probably cause is a common sense determination that an offense occurred. So what would you say the percentage is of the cases that move forward as opposed to those that are dismissed that a preliminary hearing? Again, I have those for a certain segment of the preliminary hearings. Hang on. I want to make sure I'm not talking out of school. It's just almost exactly 85% are bound over. Those that are not bound over frequently are the original charge is not bound over, but another charge, either a lesser offense or a different offense, will be bound over. The most frequent reason that a case is not bound over is the officer fails to appear and answer the subpoena. So 85% are bound over. Another of the 15% that aren't bound over, a percentage of those are bound over, but under separate or different charges. Yes. Okay. And give you an example. Yeah. And so, and then some are dismissed because the officer fails to answer the subpoena. Occasionally, we'll have that. And then, of course, you all report that to the law enforcement agency and they deal with the officer who failed to report for a statement. That's nothing that happened regularly. It happens. It just, but that is not a chronic issue in connection with the public. And then in some cases, the victim comes in and says, backs off whatever the initial statement was. And in some cases, that would think that happens in a certain segment of cases frequently. And usually those cases are bound over anyway. Well, if it's a domestic violence case, the state is the victim. And so thereby, they can't dismiss that case or they're not supposed to dismiss that case correct. Usually those are the cases. I just want to get that out there to make sure people realize we're not letting domestic violence in domestic violence cases. The state does forward with the case. And those cases almost frequent times when we'll have a victim come in and we can't. Yeah. And I guess the point I was trying to get at is the 85% plus we add in the other percent with the change charges. So it's pretty close that every case that goes in front of the magistrate judge, the vast, vast majority of them are bound over. And if these individuals are not out of jail, then they go right back to the Fulton County jail. That's the case. It's just continue to move forward. That's this is 15 days into their incarceration. Correct. Okay. Good. Go ahead. All right. So all right. Well, that's it. That's pretty much it. The beginning part of. And then the process is either the case is ready for bound over. And that means are they going to be subject to a Fulton County grand jury or they're going to be subject to an accusation? Okay. Which is like a criminal information. If you could explain that. Sure. And you know, I've just left my preliminary hearing. Okay. I've gone back to the jail. I don't have a bond. What's next? Right. And so at that point in time. Well, one step on my investment. He is the biggest happy time on. I'm being here. All right. So once that happens, case intake will then start to investigate that particular case and gather evidence. Getting that case ready for trial. And that is gathering any police reports, any detective supplemental reports. Anybody cams. And so once that happens, we start, we'll put the case together. And once the evidence is sufficient to prove that case beyond a reasonable down at that point. We will say it's ready for indictment and then present that case to the grand jury. Now the grand jury, the level or the level of proof is not beyond a reasonable doubt. It's still only probable cause. But before we indict a case, we're looking for something in between probable cause and beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not prosecute any case that we feel that we cannot prove that trial beyond a reasonable doubt. In those cases, our subsequently dismissed. So part of. Do you have an idea what percentage cases are dismissed at that point? Say 5%? Okay. We'll be dismissed at that point. What was the average time from the process of building a case? It depends on the case. Of course, the ultimate goal is to try to get it done within 90 days. But depending on if it's a complex murder case or complex on the robbery or serial rape case, then those cases are obviously going to take longer. If it's something that requires something from the GBI is going to take longer because we have to wait on the results from the GBI before we can indict even a drug case. We need those results back. Okay. Thank you. So what does the individual do while they're waiting on the GBI to come back? Well, they're in custody with or without a bond, then they're going to be in custody until that time. Now, even if the case is indicted, does not mean that person is going to be released from the jail. So you have people in custody that are pre-indipement and post-indipement. In great point, explain the difference between pre-indipement and post-indipement. So pre-indipement is what we're doing in order to get the case ready to present to the grand jury. Once it's presented to the grand jury, then it'll become post-indipement or an indicted case which is passed along to the trial division. Right. And how long can someone sit...what do you think the reasonable time or what we normally experience somebody to sit in jail without an indictment? And I do understand and look, we're talking about individuals with no bond and serious felonies. So with no bond? Or bond or no bond? Okay. Yeah, because if they can't make bond, that doesn't matter that they have one. Like I said, our goal is to do it within 90 days. But that may end up being 120 days. After 90 days, then that person, even if they do not have a bond, after 90 days, that person is automatically entitled to a bond. So a bond would have to be set after that 90th day. And that's any case. That's any case. Even when you were talking about a serial rapist, a serious smurrer, so after how many days? After 90 days that person... After three months, the judge is required to give them a bond. Required to give them a bond. And that bond can be anything from a dollar to ten million. It could, right. And so I don't have the actual average that a person will stay pre-enditement. Because there are lots of factors that affect that number. Just yesterday, we had a case that showed that the person was in custody for say 600 days. And it showed that it was unindicted. The charge was unindicted. However, when I looked at it, the person is actually in custody on an indicted murder case. Picks up a new case. It could have been five days ago. He picks up that new case. But his in custody time will show that it's the 600 days. It doesn't break it down between, okay, he has a new case while he's in custody. And say that unindicted is five days, it will show that it's unindicted for the four time that he's been held in custody. Okay, so there's not a second line for a separate case. It doesn't separate them out like that. No. Okay. But your investigators can see that if you call somebody in and say it's explained to me while John Smith is sitting in custody. He's sitting in jail unindicted for 600 days. They can say, well, sir, he's actually indicted. That's the exact situation. Yeah, he's actually indicted on the front end. And this is just an additional case that we're just moving through the system. I got a phone call saying, hey, this guy's been in custody for six hundred days unindicted. And I'm like, that's impossible. And when I looked at it, that was the situation. He's actually in custody on a murder case. In the new case, also a serious case that occurred while he was in custody. I think we're getting to a very important point here. And I believe that the way maybe the numbers are being reported and the information is being communicated out. It's causing confusion for a lot of folks, right? I think it's from the offender, from the community, from certainly all of us that are involved in this process. Maybe one of the takeaways from today, I don't know if we're going to be able to figure this out while we're all sitting in this committee meeting is, how can we show those in a different way that's easier for people to digest that information? Because some of the numbers from the outside would look very alarming, right? But if there are good reasons why they should be there, we have to figure out a way to portray that and show that to the public differently. So, well, maybe we can work on it. And I think the most extreme situation that will show that the person is in custody unindicted is if that person is arrested and prior to being indicted is deemed to be incompetent. That person is then sent to Georgia Regional and an attempt is made to make him competent to stand trial. So, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to indict an incompetent person. And so, that number can be a very high number. And help me correct me, I'm not an attorney. And, you know, at times I do take pride in that. We might be. Sure, we're not. But there is a, is there not a statute that requires the state has a certain amount of time to determine whether a person is or is not competent? So, in other words, we've all seen one flew over the cookers nest. We don't have the option of just holding somebody indefinitely while we're waiting to see if they're competent or not. Is that not correct? I know in Maryland, I think they have like three years, which I think is no pun intended in saying, but to hold an individual in custody without any proceedings. But here in Georgia, do we have a standard that person would be in Georgia Regional Hospital? It's in my Georgia, West Georgia Regional Hospital. I used to deliver people there and I've walked those halls and very familiar with it. What I'm saying is, if we have somebody that needs to be that we are concerned about their competency, and I think in all capital cases, competency is one of the things they don't even get to say they're not. We send them or we have them evaluated. But in these cases, when we send them there to be for a competency hearing, is there a clock? We can't just let them sit there, can we? Look at him, see if we are. Well, I'm curious that book is got everything in it, I think. The initial evaluation has to take place within seven days. Seven days of what? Of referral. Okay. And that's just a first cut, 30,000 foot view. Then the, once the accused is transported to one of the regional hospitals, that hospital has 90 days to make an evaluation. At the end of 90 days, they are required to report back to the court, whether the person is in fact competent. If the person is incompetent, is the person and the standard is likely to be restored to competency. If they determine that the defendant is likely to be restored to competency, they have an additional 90 days before they have to make another report. If the person is determined to not be likely to be restored to competency, and those cases are frequently where there is some kind of cognitive issue. It's not necessarily a behavioral issue. It's where the frequently not being restored to competency is frequently a cognitive issue. And the George Regional Hospital has 180 days in order to determine whether or not the person needs to be maintained in an inpatient facility, or whether the person is safe enough to be released into the community, either with or without support. Okay, so in 170, excuse me, one year and seven days, I think is what I, if my hair is County Math kicked in, they are at some point. Okay, then after a year, and I'll use West Central Georgia Regional Hospital as an example, they determine that the individual is not competent. Then they can have that individual held in a facility for how long? Once the, once there is a determination that the person is not likely to regain competency and requires inpatient hospitalization, there has to be an annual review. And that, then that person is no longer in the criminal justice system at all. That then becomes the mental health system. Then, then where is their case? Essentially at that point, their case is placed on an open intended what's called the dead doc. I know the dead doc. And to be clear, a case can be taken off the dead docket. A case can be taken off the dead docket. So, and the, and the, just because they're placed on a dead docket, it does not remove them from, from Yalls radar. I mean, they may be on the outside edge because if it's something that where they can be rehabilitated, and of course, this brings up another question, I'm concerned that somebody could, could be sitting in a mental health facility. And every 12 months, we get something back say they're still not good, they're still not good. And then we have victims out there, no matter what the charge is, that are not receiving any kind of justice at all. And, and again, a point that,

Chairman Albers just made is this information is not common knowledge. And so that's for I guess another committee meeting. But I'm so let's say the individual is determined to be competent. Okay. And now they are brought back to the Fulton County jail and to be clear. And I don't see the attorney from the Fulton County jail. I'm just going to try to make it in this morning or have somebody make it in. But the individual is in custody of the Fulton County jail. They transport them to West Central. If you were to go into the computer and look at that individual. And I see the executive director Georgia Sheriff Association back there. Terry Norrisson, I know he'll correct me if I'm wrong. The jail, the sheriff and them go in the system. And they show that that that detainee own loan to West Central Georgia Regional Hospital. And so when they do their daily jail population count. They count every soul within the facility. And then there's a separate column where they will show individuals that they are responsible for that continue to belong to Fulton County. But they will show them along the different areas. Whether it's in another county for another case or whether it's at a hospital will be in evaluated. Would that be correct? That is correct. So that still falls into the population of the Fulton County jail. That's individual. Okay. Thank you. No, no. In terms of the last point, just make a John Hinkley in terms of do we have to. Right. Well, no, that's a perfect example. Perfect example of an essentially what you're talking about if someone's deemed to be incompetent. He's civilly committed to the state of Georgia. And so could that be something I'm going to say a legal term here. I guess you can say from law school, but can you keep him in perpetuity? Pretty much. It means until if he's never deemed to be likely to be restored and is a danger to the community, he can be kept forever. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. They just don't give. Hey, we can't. You know, we can't. Well, no, no, no, no, no. You're going to let you back out. I do understand that. And I think that's probably a fracture within the criminal justice system that we're talking about will solve. But it's something that I think needs to be understand when we talk so much in this building about mental health. And we have to be afraid that bad people don't, and I'm going to go to the other side and probably upset a few people that evil people do not use our sympathy toward those suffering for mental health in order to avoid criminal justice system. And so I think that's a. Well, that's a that's a there's a lot of opportunity there. Because I think if we've talked to the individuals who run the Fulton County jail, Mr. Norris and I've had many conversations about the amount of psychotropic medication that is administered in our jail systems today, everything from just mild cases of depression all we have schizophrenia. And I just see a lot of opportunity while I have sympathy for the legitimately mentally ill and believe me, we've experienced a lot of that through our career. Dilling with individuals who really were out of touch with reality, but also understanding the personalities of a lot of these individuals that see would see this as a great opportunity to avoid judgment and justice. Well, that's why we're here. Yeah. Yeah. I would say root those and vet those people out who are lying and abusing the system. Do they exist? Yes. And do you have alerts within the system that lets you know that it's time for the next evaluation that is time for the next report from the hospital to ask whether this person is competent or not? Well, the first communication is to that judge that. Is it directly to the judge or is it through the DA's office? No, it is. We're a party, of course, to the matter of terms of HIPAA and those other matters. We are given notice of the hearing and connection with the evaluation, the annual evaluation, but that first contact goes to the court. The court will let us, hey, we're going to set this hearing date. So the defensitory, the defendant's transport, where that person is, the judge is there, and we're going to have evaluation sometimes. But you still own the jacket. You still own the case, right? Absolutely. That doesn't just disappear. And this is part of the case file, correct? Correct. Correct. But this is one of those unique things. Instead of you moving it to the court, the court sends it back to you and keeps you evaluated. How would you say the court retains the state of Georgia through either, you know, Georgia Regional or through Superior Court keeps jurisdiction over that person? I understand what you're saying. And we don't necessarily need to make it about the mental health case. But once you go in front of a judge and have a hearing, the case still belongs to you, correct? Absolutely. And the disc attorney's office makes the determination as to whether you're going to move forward with prosecution. And depending on the question and say, for instance, if it's a, if it's a mental health evaluation and we certainly believe it will argue based on our evaluation of the report from the psychiatrist assigned to make it a report and a review of, hey, this person is not appropriate for release. We'll put that person on the stand as a witness or anybody else that can give an opinion as to our position. Do you ever challenge these? Are there opinions? Yes, we do. Depending on what those opinions say. Right. Right. Very good. Absolutely. I'll get a question if I can. Yes. You're all right. Thank you, Ms. Chairman. One of the things that we've been discussing as we've learned and educated this committee on the process is when folks are in the system, I'll just say, broadly, sometimes merely getting that date on the trial counter on the court counter ends up solving and resolving and people coming up with a plea and disposing of those cases quickly. Is that your same impression that simply sometimes is getting to that point can help to expedite the process? If I'm understanding your question correctly, what in terms of efficiency will help push cases forward exactly? I mean, more resources to the court, more resources for us and for the system as a whole. Then some of it is I can just guarantee you that the more judges we have to spread out the responsibilities of cases amongst the venture who works very, very hard here in Fulton County. But I think to Chairman Albers' point though, getting it on the trial docket doesn't knock some of the rust off of it to where public defenders or paid attorneys want to get more engaged into the plea side of it because I think we all know in my numbers maybe a little inflated, but I would say probably 90% of all cases are pled. We're not running jury trials day in, day out in every jurisdiction in the United States as we would see on some of these scripted television shows. Long-term jury trials are an anomaly in today's criminal justice system. So would the work of the District Attorney's Office to get these cases on the docket and call John Q attorney and say, hey, we got John Smith on the trial docket, we're going to see y'all in 45 days. And then he gets with John Smith and goes, hey, look, here's what the deal is and they come to you and you go to the Elm and y'all start negotiating what you think is fair. Right. And first of all, thank you, Senator Albers for that question to specify the disposition and expedite that process. That's right. Obviously the trial is the last. That is everyone, hey, this is the time to make a decision going to plea when to try this case. But there's certainly variables that are attached to that context. And so many times, certainly, our office will contact times in which we file a motion with the court to place a case on the trial counter because we need something to happen in this matter. But we're not the only party to these matters, you understand? And so there, it depends on the schedule number one set by the court itself. They are the arbiter or the referee of matters. And so I know like Mike Cleven Browns, they lost in the playoffs. I want them to, hey, I want to have this game and I want to win it on this date and time. But then I fell or the league may have some say in when that is addressed. And so ultimately we can bring that to the attention of the court. But the court is the last, I would say, object that sets that matter. Let me roll a hand grenade across the floor then. Is the district attorney's office and the court, is it a push or is one side, or are y'all standing there with cases stacked, ready to get on court dockets? And the court's just not moving? Or is the court have court dockets that have space on them and y'all are, and this, please don't be offended by this word, y'all are mired in the process because you've got to have investigations. You've got to go through all these cases and make sure that everything is put in order and anybody that's never stood inside of a DA's office and watched the meticulous process you have to go through may not completely understand. This isn't just grab it in the rest report and run it in front of a judge and say, hey, Joe did this and blah, blah, blah, blah and then the case is adjudicated. There's a lot of homework that has to be done. There's a lot of constitutional rights wrapped up and all this stuff. So is there a, if we've got to figure out what's slow in the cases down, is it public, excuse me, is the district attorney's office overwhelmed and these things are moving slow or is the court moving slow? And when you're calling saying, hey, we've got cases, we want to get on trial docket, they're saying, yeah, we're backed up right now. We just, we don't have room. All right, first of all, it's a legitimate question and it's one of, I hate to sound like a lawyer again, but it depends and when I mean by that is this, there's several variables to go into how quickly a case is resolved. That means the type of case. I can tell you this as I initially started. Now, what is resolved, I mean, resolved means these are the repli or there's a jury trial. Okay, so it's a judge. Judicated, so I've got to be judged. And so I can tell you that we all need more resources. That means the court, that means our office, the Pell Pet defenders and Department of Corrections here in the Senate, your words are probably. But where's the kink in the hose right now and understand what I'm focusing on is overcrowding in the Fulton County jail. And citizens sitting in the jail that have not been convicted of what they are charged with is the process that we've been discussing this morning. Is that just take so long that these individuals are being backed up into the jail or is the process running as efficiently as it can with the resources that you have. And then when you get it all done, you know, you got them trial ready and the courts are saying, good job, but you're going to have to wait. I can tell you this, the number one thing in my experience in 20 years, when I'm the one where there's so many different things is that to relieve the pressure of the volume of cases and defendants and just the process itself, post pandemic, even pre pandemic to some stations. And that's the fact that Fulton County needs more judges, which is need more judges. Okay, so your answer to the question is that the where we're hitting the wall is y'all have the cases ready. And if we had more judges, there'd be more room and we could get them into the trial docket. I can tell you this. And look, we're not picking when we're going to have the judges coming here and do their thing. And look, they're not going to lock any of us up. At least not on this side of the table, but we need it. But we're all friends here. And so if we're running into it there and I think Chairman Albers alluded to that a little earlier when he talked about how busy Fulton County is, if it's a judge issue, then we need to know that because the determination of the spirit court judges are made inside this building. And I'll say this to you that every judge on that bench is working their tail off in connection with their daily responsibilities, criminally and civilly. But I know that because obviously these variables that exist, it would be helpful to us in terms of our resources in the DA's office and what's available to our superior court judges. Just to say, please Chairman Albers. We thought that that would help us relieve some of the pressure in terms of getting cases adjudicated faster for the public. What I can tell you, that the symptom of our system, the volume of cases, the backlog due to COVID, these are all variables that I guess factor in in context how quickly a case gets to trial. And I can tell you that that obviously are addressing these matters and obviously, you know, what certainly comes to violent crime here and folding county into the state. The more resources that we have and the more focus we have, the better the outcomes will be as you can see with our prosecutions here of violent crime and gangs. And I'm sorry, Senator, I'm sorry. No, no, no, you're fine. I appreciate it. I didn't want to cut you off. And I think getting back to Chairman Robertson's point and we'll obviously have the judiciary come and then for meeting and they'll be able to present their facts. I actually want to thank Fulton County. They provided us both Chairman Robertson and I a pretty detailed report of how that looks today, you know, and even by a per judge as far as moving those case along, getting those those dates said things that nature. And I think one of the things that would be helpful to us again, not write this moment probably, but in the future is we want to make sure that the statistics that we're getting, whether it be from the county proper from the judiciary, we want to make sure we're getting the same from you to make sure all those numbers are the same. Because if you look at this in its totality, when people self-report, it's easy to self-report what will you see the best numbers to be, right? And if we're going to work on this as a part of the component could be a staffing challenge we talked about, we want to make sure that they're all equal. So one of my takeaways would be for Chairman Robertson and I and the rest of the committee is to see those numbers because I'd like to see again what the county gave to us. When the judiciary comes here, you all see for getting those actually through the judicial part of the system for the spirit court judges. And we would, I've just saying that we all need more resources. Everybody respect that very much. Thank you. Well, and one of my concerns would be, unless say we gave more resources to the Fulton County Disco Attorney's Office to make the system even more efficient, which we all know each and every day we can be more efficient. We love that. And that's going to get y'all, that's going to get more cases ready. Sure. But if we don't, if we continue to have the the issue within the judiciary, it doesn't matter how many resources will give you because these people are just sitting there holding their jacket, waiting to go into a courtroom. And the courtroom is not available because you're saying we need more resources in the in the courtroom too. Exactly. And I can tell you it isn't something in which, you know, this isn't caused by the judges. It is caused by volume volume. And so as I said, you know, each judge works their tail off in the superior court. And volume is a crime problem, right? It is. Yeah. And so, and I think that that needs needs to be pointed out, you know, clearly, yes, that if we could solve the crime problem, and I know there was an announcement a couple of weeks ago where murder rates are down in Fulton County and all that. And, you know, that's all that's great. It really is. I don't want to, I don't want to gloss over that. But there's obviously still some problems because the individuals that are there have to be processed and people are still being victims of crime. Yes. I'm having a glass company meet me here at the Capitol and they're going to replace the window with my truck or somebody looked at that truck and thought that's obviously belongs to some guy in South Georgia and there's got to be a gun in it. Well, there wasn't. So it worked out good. But the, you know, if we, if we can crack the nut on the crime problem, then we alleviate the pressure all the way through the system. Absolutely. But right now is the Fulton County District Attorney's Office is it running as efficiently as it can with the resources it has? It is. Okay. And the cases were hitting all the marks on the time frames that were required to, whether it's speedy trial request, whether it's any other case, if anybody is in the word, is the word we've been using, if anybody is languishing there, it is not because of inefficiencies within the Fulton County District Attorney's Office. I'm not aware of it. I mean, I wouldn't say it's because of inefficiencies on behalf of the District Attorney's Office. I'm not talking about intentional. I'm just saying, yeah. Right. And of course, resources, again, would help. You know, just case in point, at one point, there were over 18,000 unindicted cases. And at this point, it's below 10. So I think as far as an efficiency standpoint, we've gotten better as we've gone along. It real quick, before we get the 18,000, were those all incarcerated? No. Okay. That is. And those are, to be clear, those are individual cases, not individuals. Correct. Is that correct? Correct. Because some of these individuals have multiple cases. Exactly. Right. Okay. Exactly. And so from an efficiency standpoint, of course, you can always do better, but doing better comes with learning as you go along. And at this point, I think we are about as efficient as we can be with the resources that we have. Of course, with more resources, you become more efficient and you will be able to move more cases through. One of the things that that that also would help is we're waiting, say, for instance, drug cases. That's approximately 23% of the felony arrest in Ford and County. I apologize. I say that last part again. Drug arrests. Yeah. Approximately 23%, 23 and 25%. To be felony drug arrests. felony drug arrests associated with other crimes are solely drug arrests. A large percentage of those are going to involve a gun. Right. Okay. And when I say involve a gun, person is in possession of a gun. Of course, from our standpoint, we can indict those cases until the crime lab comes back. Initially, that time frame was four to six months waiting on the results of what that substance was. We come out the GBI crime lab. Yes. Okay. And so, of course, they could use more resources to speed up that process. Case in point, recent visit to New York. They're processing their cases within a week. And that includes crime lab reports and everything. It's gotten back to them generally within a week. And I got to ask, how are they doing that? In house crime lab. Okay. That's what I was thinking. Of course. And just the way they're integrated with everybody being on the same page. There's one police department, works hand in hand with the GAs office. Of course, we have so many different agencies that contribute to what I will call the inefficiencies that you speak of, because each one of them operates in a different way. And with us trying to gather information from each one of them, we have to do it in a different way. Certain agencies want to do in one way. Certain agencies, we have to go through open records in order to get the evidence and to prosecute their families. I mean, what would you have to do to open records to a law enforcement agency in a case that you're prosecuting? That's a good question. Well, give me a good answer. Well, give me the example. And listen, I want to be perfectly clear here when everybody on this committee is 100% with what you guys are trying to do. But this is not the time to be shy. If there's an agency that is requiring the prosecutor to file open records requests to get evidence, not only do I think that is improper use of the open records law, but it is a huge efficiency and it is a problem for the victims of crimes if we're putting a nod in the middle of this process. So is it their law enforcement agencies that require the Fulton County Disco Attorney's Office to file an open records request to receive evidence? Oh, God, that's a man's name. Yes. Okay, could you tell me what agency has that policy? That Atlanta Police Department has that agency. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. And so that that's part of the other is aside from APD. I don't know them offhand, but I think there are others. As a follow-up, that would be another helpful bit of information for us. And I do want to point out he sounds so much nicer than me and I appreciate that. Really quick. I've got somebody's been standing in the queue for a few minutes. I won't Senator Halpern to ask her. She has a... Well, so I was going to ask and I think you hit it. Are there, in terms of the GBI and making sure that you've got the information you need in in-house labs? Is it, do you happen to know? Is Georgia unique in that everything has to filter up to kind of the few crime labs that we have, or is it becoming more of a trend that in-house labs are happening across other states and other jurisdictions? I think it's happening more and more across other states where the police departments have in-house labs. I think the closest one is Charlotte. Okay, and then, but that was not going to be the original question. No, man, go ahead and go ahead. And we've kind of bypassed it, but when we were talking about the courts and the needs for the courts to have more judges, I did want to just intersect to say that, um, Fulton County, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong. Our last additional judge was in 2009 and we did just make a request for another one that did get turned down. And I do know there's a matrix and Chairman Halpern is very, very familiar with it that's used throughout the state of Georgia based on caseloads, based on the number of judges and everything else involved. And in order to qualify, there's a system set up. And when I look at the list, there's a pecking order. And I know the three that are on there now and Chairman Halpern is correct and if I'm wrong, Fulton County is not one of the three because of the way they process. And I have a lot of faith in the process that they use, but I think it's an important conversation that we have to have because obviously I'm not picking winners or losers, but obviously, listening to your testimony, the DA's office is moving these criminal cases, getting them your investigators and from the pre trial and everything, getting it all set to go. And it's not being done and I'm going to emphasize it for the fifth think time, we want to figure out a way that we can have and look, some of these people are absolutely evil, but they have not surrendered their constitutional rights just because they're evil. And we are overburdening the men and women that work in the Fulton County jail when we are not moving cases efficiently out of there. And we talk about information, they are being made the bad guys and they are not. I don't think there are any bad guys in this process, so we need to work on that. But one thing I wanted to touch on, some of those that are determined and competent, they are sent back to the Fulton County jail and held there based on the level of incompetence. If it's sometimes if it's learning disabilities, some of these other things, in my experience, some are held there and then the site units will come to the jail or I know the jail that I was involved with. We had a psychiatrist and others that coordinated with West Central Georgia that they're not necessarily because of bad space and other things around the state, so I'll dive a little bit deeper into that. Chair, Chair, I'm paying. I did have one question kind of going back stepping to where we've started, but from time of intake to through the preliminary hearing, what percentage would you say that there is a competency issue that would slow down the process? It's less than 100%. Yeah, I don't, first of all, that exact number, I don't think we have here, but it is a low amount, just in my experience, down here for the last 18 years. Would you say that a lot of times that's initiated by the defense? Yes, absolutely. But by law, we suspect we have an obligation to bring that to the attention of the court and on delvin to that issue, we have that ethical responsibility as prosecutors. One of the things that we've been looking at and starting when Sheriff Elbat and his team came in is benchmarking, how does that look across the state and the nation? And if you look at those kind of four pillars that Chairman Robertson mentioned earlier, you were actually referencing Cleveland, right? Yeah. And your previous experience. What we're trying to figure out is, okay, who is doing it the same? Who is doing it better? Who is doing it worse? How can we get the lessons learned out of that? What are their best practices? Are they using a better process, a better technology? What is their HR process, like as far as staffing the court? What things are being done better? Because I've always believed the greatest forum of flattery is imitation. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. If somebody else has it figured out, one of the things that we're going to hopefully have as an output of this time and this committee is a different look at what we have and how we can improve that process. So my question, I guess, to the three of you would be, have you done any benchmarking like that or looking at other jurisdictions to see how we could improve? Like I said before, thank you guys. A recent visit to New York and we went to three of the burls in New York. And I think it was Queens the day before we got there, there was a situation where a crossing guard was run over by a DUI driver. And within 24 hours, the DA, ADA in that office was able to pull up on her screen. When it's actually...

happened that just will happen to be a patrol car sitting at the intersection also. Was she was able to show us the dash cam from that accident showing exactly what happened. The hospital video of where they went in with the driver who ended up being DUI. The actual administration of the breath test, the demeanor of that driver, and all of this was within 24 hours. And like I said, they can turn around their cases within a week. But again, the integration of their entire system with the police department and the DA's office, that was to happen here. It would be probably a month before we were able to see that video. So that's a technology integration and process fellowship. Yes. And that's just one case that happened right while we were there. To give you a timeframe, the accident happened when school was getting out. We were sitting there all for that 9 o'clock the next morning watching. And do we know what tools and technology they are using and are we now going to look at that as a possibility of using that? We are looking into it. I don't know the name of it. Well, they have a in the basement of the police department. They have a center down there that will rival any in the world as far as cameras and and tracking. In the case you're talking about the dash cam, it's automatically downloaded when the officer either does it or when he or she goes back in near the precinct. What's they going to precinct? They download all of their stuff. Right. So obviously the district attorney's office has access to that. It sounds like possibly unfettered, but because it has to be identified as that case. So is this a software program? Case management program? I think it's a combination of case management and just their ability to share their stuff. The DA's office actually will get an alert of that and automatically as soon as it's downloaded, have access to that. The information. The Intox Seminar Test that was given at the hospital. Yes. And you said they had the results. They had paper results or they had video of the actual test. I don't know how they relate the results, but the actual administration of the test was on the body cam. On the off-road body cam. So a lot of this came off resources that the police department had. Yes. Such as the cameras side of the vehicle, the camera on the officer and those. Okay. Yeah. All right. So we've got a case. It's ready to go to trial and where the only obstacle that we have at that point is a position on the trial docket. Okay. How would you say the public defenders are you finding that most of the time the defense attorneys are ready to go? Absolutely. Look, it all depends depending on the nature of the case and circumstances whether it be the state or the defense. It's just that obviously with any jurisdiction, whether you're in Cleveland, New York, you can only try one case at a time. And so the more complex the case, the longer it takes to resolve through a jury trial. And so that takes the court and the judge away from other matters that they're dealing with in terms of the disposition and resolution andjudication of other cases. You know, for your own trial, say for a murder case, I'll give an example. Just I think a lot of the judges and our jurisdiction have 30 plus murders on their dockets. And murders generally take about a week. Many of them longer. And so and nails cases are very serious. Our victims and their families. And to adjudicate them, it takes a week to try. And that's three, four days, five days, ten days in which the court has to address that while other matters not being dressed with either civilly or criminally. And so, you know, and that's just part of the process that slows things down. Let me ask you this and this came up at one of our last meetings. Do those outside of jail, do they were, how do they, is there any preferential or is if somebody is being held in the Fulton County jail, do they take precedents over someone who is out on bond? Yes, the exact same charge. Absolutely. Okay. And so you're taking it perfect. So if you have a guy that's, you know, out on a armed robbery, it's rare, but they do make monocasional. And you have a person that's in jail on armed robbery. That judge was seeing we're going on the jail case right now. But the amount of time it takes to try a case as we are, my colleagues here are veterans in terms of trying cases. It takes about three, four days to try a case. Well, if the case is tried and I think what we've established is the vast majority cases are planned. Right. So is more emphasis given on cases to be planned within the jail or out on the street or are they given the same? Because in that case, in that, a plaid case, we don't need the resources that we would on a jury trial or a bench trial. You're coming. Um, yeah. You're coming about the majority, vast majority of cases are plaid. Yes. That that is the drug cases, the shoplifting cases, the, the more simple cases. I think the example that was given deals with a murder case on armed robbery case. Which of course, murder is going to be a mandatory life sentence. So not many of those are coming in. That's right. We're talking about a, we're talking about an armed robbery case. An armed robbery case. The mandatory amendment is going to be 10 years. Right. And so not many of those people are going to come in and just automatically plead. Unless they think they can get the minimum and not, not get 20 or something like that. Exactly. Yeah. Our lives are around the Capitol. So, so those cases generally are going to be tried. Okay. What percentage would you say of those types of cases are in the Fulton County jail? Arm robbery, serious case violent cases. Okay. And look, I mean, that's a great answer. Most of them. So, so if that's the case where we focus in on those non cases like that and trying to, trying to get those pushed through. Yes. There are several things that we're doing in order to alleviate those people being held in custody. IE, we meet with the public defender's office regularly and go through the list to see who we can not just give a bond, but a lot of them are given what's called a UGR where they're automatically released. What's a UGR? UGR? UGR. UGR. Okay. What is that? That's a judicial release. Oh, I'm scared. I'm scared you just should really. Yeah, I wrote that legislation. I just don't always use the full term. Yeah, I'm the guy who offered this like for them. But Judge said the bond at a dollar for the most. And so it's being used in that sense to alleviate the problem of, say, the drug addict that's being held. And so that's just one of the things that we do. The other thing is that we're starting to actually attempt to negotiate dispositions prior to indictment. And of course, more resources towards that type of program would go a long way. Are any considerations given to detainees at the Fulton County jail charge with crimes that may be suffering some medical condition? Would that expedite the case in any way if knowing that the longer we held the individual in the Fulton County jail, the greater cost it would be to the Fulton County taxpayer, whether it's kidney dialysis or whatever. And it would, it would cause greater risk to the individual being held there as far as possibility of suffering a major medical issue. Definitely when that type of situation is brought to our attention that that case will receive special treatment. Do you all communicate well with the sheriff's office when it comes to that kind of things where they say, okay, we've got this case. It's this and this individual's cost on us $100,000 a month. So if we could some way get this individual in the trial docket and get this case moving. I mean, those kind of conversations happen. Yes. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Oh no. What you were saying, just we just have to, and I apologize. We have to realize overall. Sometimes we take a granted. I love the great state of Georgia. Everybody wants to be here in Atlanta. Sounds like you love Ohio. I'm a boy. I'm gonna have a book. I, but this red dirt got into my blood veins many years ago in college. And so I, I try my best to get back and I did. So first of all, guys, thank you for having me. But the reality of it is is, well, these contexts, Atlanta's a popular city. The state is a popular place. And so we, it's not getting smaller. It's getting larger every day. And so those who live here in Fulton County, those who commit, what I mean by commit, but practice their businesses and their professions here in Fulton County. And so it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. And so, you know, with that correspondingly, all of our law enforcement partners that includes, you know, law enforcement that includes the courts that cause the public defenders. All of our, you know, it's going to cost more money, I suspect. And because we need more resources to deal with it. And it's, I guess, it's a problem sometimes because of, you know, volume in the amount of crime that sometimes that we do have here. Because we're popular. People want to be in Atlanta. We love it. But the good, the bad end, the, I guess, uh, term to pay my apologize question was first, the number of the process, we were talking about the judges earlier in the number of judges. Does that process include consideration of the crime rate in that jurisdiction? I'm, it's, I don't know the exact methodology to criteria. I'm not, I mean, if there's higher crimes, it would be obviously a need for greater, for greater number of judges. Right. I don't know how that's, uh, traditionally been done in Georgia. That's something I need to, obviously, when we leave this meeting, we're going to be researching in terms of percentages and per capita. Um, but I can just tell you from my experience, um, and, and connection with just being here, you know, everyone's working, and working, and working, and working, and, uh, it's just that the more people we get, the more problems, good and bad. And we're just trying to do with the bad problems that we have. And the resources allocated to them. And I, everybody needs more. We need more judges need more, public defenders need more suited to the Department of Corrections and GVI. And those are all our partners, you know, in these matters. Chairman Albers? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the things we, we talked about earlier was GCIC. Yes. And how we're getting data. There was reports, I want to say probably six months to a year and a half ago, kind of intermittently, about the lag with updating GCIC. And because of that, we sometimes, as we're going through the criminal justice process, didn't know if somebody had committed multiple crimes yet, because without having the data in the system, you know, that happens. And I think, you know, some of the examples that were shown through the media were that, you know, someone was then let out, you know, on a very low bond or what have you that actually had other pretty significant, very serious cases that we shouldn't have done that. So can you help us understand the process with updating GCIC? Who does that how and when and where we think that stands today? Well, I'll say, obviously, it starts with, you know, the GCIC itself in the clerk's office, certainly in Fullon County and other judicial counties for greater accuracy in connection with, you know, suspect of people's criminal histories. I don't know because I'm not a systems person. I don't know if my call on for a second here. I think connection with how we better GCIC, I just know that there needs to be greater form of reporting and accuracy of such. How we do that in the state of Georgia, how we do that in Fullon County, I'm open for I am, but we are all open to do that. It is necessary so we can have an accurate recording as to what they've done. This is a process that we're at that didn't just occur in the last 10 years. This has been going on, you know, since I've been practicing even for not here. But in the process, once you're a judge of case, then the case goes to the clerk's office, Spirit Court clerk. Spirit Court clerk has individuals employed by he or she that enter the disposition into GCIC and uploaded of course into NCIC for whatever the need may be. The primary responsibility of those of even if the case is an all-prost or dead-docketed, that stuff is forwarded over to the clerk's office. It is. And then individuals and the term escapes me right now that are certified to go into GCIC and NCIC. There are two types. Any officer of the court can go in and view GCIC and NCIC. But, and we'll just stick with GCIC, but only certain individuals within any agency is allowed to go in there and edit or add anything into GCIC. So GCIC within the district attorney's office is a tool used to gather information. You do not go into GCIC from within the DA's office and make any changes. It takes a, I believe it's a tax officer, is what I'm trying to remember. That's correct. A tax officer in the clerk's office or a tax officer in another law enforcement agency that has the certification through the GBI to go in there and make those changes. So, to, to, to Senator Albers point, we need to focus on the clerks of superior court making those changes within there. And I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, the Fulton County clerk, are they the clerk of superior and state court or is it separate? It's separate. So the state court clerk can also go in and make the adjustments coming out of the solicitor general's office and things of that nature. Okay. And it's, it's, it's not a simple process, but if it's not updated, then it deprives the district attorney of the tool needed to make sure when your investigators are running those, those initial background checks as to whether all that information is correct or, or absent. Yeah. Yeah, Mr. Chairman, it may be helpful for us to to bring the clerk in as well. I think so. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question probably for the judiciary, but do you all find any, is there a system that you understand and flow because superior court judges also handle civil cases and where, and the attorneys will correct me. I'm sure there is no, there's no necessarily constitutionally bound time frame on moving a civil case as opposed to moving a criminal case where there are. And so have you all ran into any issues where there's been delay in the court system while civil cases are being heard as opposed to criminal cases? No, I, I, I, in my experience, in my personal experience, criminal cases take precedent. And that is the name focus and connection with cases that are adjudicated and tried. Obviously, the civil vac is something that's certainly very important, but to our superior court, in my experience in Fulton County, criminal cases take precedent over because of the person, obviously, a person may be incarcerated or whatever. That is the focus of that court. If, say, for instance, there's a competing criminal docket and civil docket, which you may have. For sure. There is a criminal case for trial or civil case for trial. I mean, obviously, there are factors on how all that case is whatever, but the in my experience at Fulton County Superior Court will, you know, pick that criminal case. Because of those factors. Fulton County judges, are they assigned to criminal dockets and civil dockets? Or do they do hybrid dockets that may have civil and criminal all together? No, first of all, of the 2015 that are assigned, you have four, of course, that are assigned to the family court doing family court wins the divorces and that's other things. And then you have your regular civil cases would be met mal, medical, malpractice or contract dispute, significant number. How many judges are assigned to that? 15. Okay. 16, I believe 15 or 16. Okay. How many judges are assigned to criminal? So the same. So you have criminal dockets. Criminal judges have a criminal docket and they have a civil docket. So a single judge will have a criminal docket and a civil docket. Correct. They're responsible for yes. Yeah. Okay. How engaged would you say the the DA's office is with the sheriff's office and the jail operations? Would you mean by engagement? What I want to say is is their coordination? Is there consistent coordination where meetings or whatever, where you sit with the sheriff and he says, you know, right now my population is here. I need to get it down to here. Can we sit and talk about some of these cases and where they are so I can kind of make some plans for this because our tour of the jail, the jail has to run. Absolutely. And so there has to be maintenance done and there was a particular time that myself and chairman Albers were in the jail. They had to move detainees from one area, combine them with detainees from another area so they could go back to this area and clean it up, paint it, correct some maintenance issues so they could move them back. And so, you know, the jail is a living breathing thing, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. And so, for you talked about the New York model, is what we'll call it and it sounds extremely efficient but obviously there's great communication between the NYPD and the and the district attorney's office there. So, do you have, does the district attorney's office have that kind of relationship with sheriff? The lot that you can sit down and the sheriff says, hey, this is this is my problem and we talked about the health care issue. You know, I've got three inmates that are have states to cancers of whatever or I have this, this, and this and coordinate this on a on a regular basis to try to expedite some of these cases through the system and possibly have the at some point when you all sit down with the public defender, that's one of the issues that y'all bring forth is your clients in here charged with this. It's this, this and this and we think the best solution to this is this right here or those kind of conversations happening on a regular basis or is the sheriff operating in a silo in the DA's office operating in a silo. For sure. That's a good question. Go ahead. I think those conversations happen quite regularly. Are they formal? Pinsley, what do you mean by formal? What I mean is Senator Halperger, a really good friend of mine and she could have a bill in my committee that she wants to get her. She can see me in the hallway and say, hey, Randy, I'd really left for you to hear my bill or she can send me a letter saying, I have this bill number this, this, this and it's an established procedure. She doesn't have to send me a letter but in this case, if I were the sheriff of the DA and I knew there was an issue in the jail, then I would reach out to my counterpart and the other agency, say, hey, look, every 10 days, I want this person within my agency to meet whoever fills this role in your agency unless have a conversation and communicate so that we can make sure we're moving the cases out of there to alleviate the pressure that you have in the jail. And so I don't think there's a formal process. I don't think there's a set formal process but I do know that there are meetings with the DA myself and the sheriff and then again, I meet all the time with the public defenders and that could be formal meeting in my office or it could be an email saying, hey, my client has cancer and you know, can we either consent to a Laura bond so he can be out or will you consider dismissing the case? So that happens, I won't say on a daily basis but definitely on a weekly basis with myself and the public defenders office. Well, I think you bring it up is what they're doing in New York seems pretty smart and no one despises meetings just for the purpose of meeting that I do. But in the criminal justice system, we cannot always be reactive. We have to be proactive in these cases and if the answer is always resources, then we have to figure out what is the tipping point of those resources because we have a problem in government where once we create something, it never goes away. And so if we expand, if we build the biggest jail, and we expand the DA's office and we expand the judicial, okay, when we get our jail over population under control, then who sits down and decides who gets laid off because we have our problem solved at that point. If we ever saw us, that's what I told, we just tell everybody, you know, but as long as there were criminals, always had a job. And somebody, I say, look, if folks ever wise up, we're all unemployed. If everybody ever gets smart, starts doing the right thing. And so what we've discovered here in government and Chairman Albers has been here a lot longer than the rest of us is, it's easy for people to come in here and say, yeah, always. The miracle of Botox, but the answer can't always be just give us more people, spend more money. Every every year we had to go through and look at the every single duty that every single employee we had in our large agency did. And we had to break it down to see if we were getting the absolute best value for the nine hours that deputy sheriff, that dispatcher, that admin was doing the job. And if we found a position that we found we were getting three hours of quality value out of those nine, then we would take those three hours dispersal within the agency and we would have an inefficiency that would have to be gone. And it's no fun, but it's what the taxpayers expect from us. And so to make it a formal process and listen, I mean, there's no doubt you know what you're talking about. But these formal process is every day, 12 months out of the year to maintain what we have. So we don't run into these upticks and downticks. And I understand crime rates matter. And that's an issue, that's a conversation that we have to have with law enforcement agencies, with churches, with moms and dads and with schools to tackle the crime rate. Because sadly, the DA's office has nothing to do with the crime rate. Y'all have to eat whatever's put on your plate. And so I think as we move through this, I think one thing that we understand and Y'all aren't the first group we've had in front of here is that y'all are all working for your own mission and you're not talking to the neighbor. And the neighbor's not talking to you. And I think to get to the New York model, which I'm so glad that you're being proactive and going and looking at these things like Chairman and Chairman Outer said, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. That is the proactive effort that needs to be made throughout the criminal justice system to make sure it runs efficient. So I do think that one of the recommendations may very well be to, to, you know, there has to be some kind of policies where the right hand knows what the left's hand do. And because what's working right now is leaving citizens of Fortin County languishing in jail and this, this, this, this, when they should be in prison. I mean, because we know there's guilty people in the jail, but they're sitting there in a jail is very different from prison. And, you know, they should, they should not be sitting there in the, in the taxpayers of Fortin County who support my fellow senators should not be paying for, for people to languish in the Fortin County jail. So I think, you know, communications has to be there and it has to be formal because formulas all that works. But, um, are there any more questions from any of the Senator? Senator Abish? I'm going to have a good first off. I want to thank each three of you gentlemen for being here today for your candor for the great education. You know, we have a lot of takeaways from this. And I think the one that Senator Roberts and the Chair of the Roberts was just alluding to, you know, there's, there's, I have a technology background. All right. And it's, there's an order of people, process, and then technology, right? You can't just put a technology system in and expect it to function without having the right train capable people, the right process. And then you augment that with technology. That being said, throughout my 30 plus years in the business world, I thought when I worked in the telecommunications world, boy, they were really far behind until I started doing work for healthcare. And I thought, wow, they're much worse. And I started doing work in the financial markets and they were much worse than the other two until I got to government and realized they were way worse than all the other ones put together. So we are typically behind the times. And it's a chance, I also believe for us to propel forward, you know, several of us are also doing committee meetings on artificial intelligence, right? Good, the bad and the ugly with that too. But I'm going to implore all of us throughout what we're doing and start what you're doing to really be looking at how we can use that better moving forward. And again, I really want to thank you for your time and your calendar today and look forward to following up. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And anyone else? Senator Pray. I was just going to add to that just saying, you know, I worked in the criminal justice for 30 years in state probation, but I'd say it now know that in governmental out of times, you know, and all around, efficiency comes out in necessity. Yes. But in government, most often it comes out of a commanding necessity. And I mean, it doesn't, you know, we just kind of get used to, we need to start working at these issues as commanding necessities that we start working at how we can become, it's just like 2020, you know, till we were forced to, nobody was doing the Zoom. Right. We weren't using the technology it was already there. Absolutely. And so at necessity, we all started taking up this new technology that's been there and been just waiting on us to find a reason to use it. So I just see there's the necessities there. And so, you know, let's just keep digging and see what we can make this most efficient. You know, we all agree and I can say this that, you know, data and systems theory is a greater part of our job as we grow. We've all been in this professional probably going to be about 120 years where the experience sitting maybe 90 at this point.

That's not. That's YouTube, not me, my mom. Here, right here and in our experiences. And, you know, we will, you know, everybody's resilient in the state. And all of our partners are. And so we're committed to doing what we need to do. Thank you guys. If you need us back, we'll be back anytime. Thank you. I'm excited to help you. I was just going to say that the thing that really strikes me in the conversation that we've had, of course, is that the crime has exploded. So you've talked about the volume, but it's really also the complexity, right, of the cases that you're dealing with. And I think that what I've taken away too is that what used to be a routine case is no longer the same routine case. And because the complexity of the cases has changed and that kind of texture of the cases has changed, it really does require us to evolve. And you said the word resiliency. And while that's been happening, it is true how do we continue to build upon that? So that we're using all of the things at our disposal to deal with the new realities of the world today and the complexities that we're facing because of it. Thank you, Senator. If you guys want to hang around for a minute, I'd love to talk to you after we get out of here. Our friend, Sheriff Elbat, has come in and we'd like to ask him if he would to come up and let us throw a few fast pitches at him. Okay. All right. Oh, you're moving. My seat's high. That's what happens, Sheriff, when you find parking too fast at the Capitol. I think you're going to have to be careful. I think you're going to have to be careful. I think you're going to have to be careful. I think you're going to have to be careful. That's what happens, Sheriff, when you find parking too fast at the Capitol. You must be careful. No, you're fine. You're fine right where you are. I can turn him on where he's at. Oh, man. Good morning, Sheriff. Good to see you. Absolutely. When we first couple of meetings we met with your staff and with you and your attorneys and others and had some conversations about the Fulton County Jail. Your staff was kind enough to take Senator Albers of myself for a unpolished tour of your facility. And they allowed us to go where we wanted to go and look at what we wanted to look at. And so we've been curious with some of the efforts that have been made since this committee started. It seemed like there were some things that organically happened. And so just curious what's going on in the jail? How's the overcrowding problem? And just get us up to date if you will. So first of all, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to come before you all once again. Happy New Year to those that I have not had an opportunity to speak to personally. I am actually glad one, we're having the conversation and two, we are poised and have created a cadence since you all visit with the county, with a dream department at real estate management and some of the things. Now could we do things better? Absolutely. One of the conversations that we had yesterday with our county manager, many of you know Dick Anderson, was we're going to weekly meet on these having on jail issues, what this looks like, etc. And so what we've done every other month now is take our entire command staff. If you can imagine when you were back at the major at the sheriff's office, take our entire command staff and do our own audit. Now we're not responsible for the maintenance of the jail, the county is. Ultimately it's a team or collaborative effort that we're doing. So we started a blitz project where we shut down one unit, completely rehab it from stem to stern, and ultimately move individuals into those areas and continue to focus on those things. One of the questions I heard on the way over was, and which has been very successful for us, a collaboration between the sheriff's office, the DA's office, the public defenders, as well as our solicitor general, talking about the population. As you know a couple of years ago, we had a high, all-time high coming out of COVID, it was 3600 detainees, 600 people sleeping on the floor. Yesterday's county was 27.07. We're trying to get it below 2600 or 2600. Remind us what your bad count is. So, the bad count is now, it's still originally the facility was built for 1100 detainees. We understand they double the population of this square footage. But double bunking. Right, double bunk, which is a terrible idea. But what is your capacity? So right now, our goal is to try and get the main jail below 1600. We're trying to get the main jail of 17.07 overall with 2700 detainees without sourcing, et cetera. And so, to that, for the first time in the last month, we've not had anybody sleeping on the floor. So, we started out as an administration having 600 people sleeping on the floor through consent bonds with the help of the DA. Sheriff, I don't know who holds in the room, but I want to re-emphasize again, sleeping on the floor means sleeping on a cot that's what we call them bunkers. It's a boat. It's basically inverted and there's a mattress and the individual sleeps on that. They are not sleeping on concrete. They're not sleeping on concrete. Thank you for that clarification. So, there are mattresses that go inside this floor device that's the proper term for. We call them boats. And ultimately, we have 10 boats now that are in the medical unit because people have ambulatory issues. So, whether they are an amputee or they can't sleep higher. And so, our newest goal with the help of the county is to provide medical beds for those individuals and create five to 10 sales that are more hospital-like. And ultimately, we'll solve that problem as well. But to your very point, when we started as an administration over two years ago, we had 600 individuals sleeping on these floor devices and or mattresses. And so, now we have nobody sleeping on these floors. And that is through a collaborative effort through the DA's office, through the solicitors office, the public defenders office, and really looking, if you recall, we created an inmate advocacy unit. That unit comes through every person's record routinely and then takes those records to the presiding judge to see how quickly we can move the case. Because again, if you recall, when I took over a share, we had over 850 people that had been in jail a year or longer and not had a second court case. And so, we're in this space of this collaborative opportunities, what we're taking, to really treat people more humanely, but ultimately trying to speed up the cases. That is the end goal. And so, this consent-buying program that the DA and public defenders have been able to utilize has really been helpful to us. And so, that's our goal as we, and it does include monitoring systems in many instances so that we are releasing the right people. Yes, Chairman. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Could you again give me what that top number was before we started working on this? So, yes, it was 27.07. Oh, the top number was 3600 individuals. So, you peaked out at 3600? Yes. I mean, that's an extraordinary reduction. It was extraordinary. I mean, it's like close to 30%. Right. And I know that there are folks that are both in the room and other people who are listening. And I would implore our friends in the media that always like to report the bad news and not the good news that this needs to be reported. That significant teamwork and progress is employed. And you now are at a capacity that we feel a lot more comfortable with. Are we still working on it? The answer is certainly, do we all have more work to do? The answer is yes. But we need to make sure that we're showing the good progress that's happening. I want to thank all of you who are part of the process for doing that. Yeah, absolutely. I'll share if you said something about technology. Are you talking about technology within the jail? Or are these individuals wearing products when they exit the jail? So, 90% of them are wearing products when they exit the jail. Okay. Who is responsible for those products? Is that a sheriff's office? So, it's this duality of this duality space that we live in. Right. So, under the sheriffs in the state, they control the actual monitoring, the contract itself, but then the funding has to come from the county. That's right. But it's a condition of release. Yes. So, it's part of the bond system. In many instances, yes. Okay. I mean, it's like we used to do the old ankle monitor. Correct. And we found that it's $12 a day to let somebody out or much less than that now. You know, $2 a day to let somebody out or $100 a day to hold somebody in jail. And the opportunity here, the positive opportunity, unintended consequence, was having us as a county go back and look at where we are. At one point, we have more than 1,300 people on these monitoring devices. But it also gave us an opportunity to have conversation with the judges, and people that had been on monitoring devices for more than a year, where is their case, what does that look like? And those people that are self-reporting, accordingly, we could actually take them off, because they've shown a pattern of doing whatever the DA wants, or the judge has the condition of the bond, and then putting that on someone else and allowing the flat lining of the numbers. So, instead of having 2,000 people out on ankle monitors, we can stay steady somewhere around 1,300 to 1,400 people, and ultimately continue to your point. Pay $5 a $6 a day as opposed to the $103 a day to housing individual. Now, are you partnered with the private sector in this? So, the answer is yes. So, you're not willing to go out and purchase this stuff by yourself? Correct. So, let me level set that conversation. It's predates me, and so, as I came in, as I was sworn in as Sheriff, there was a contract in place with the county already, and there was only one responded to the RFP at the time, as my understanding, and so they ramped up to try and increase services to the Sheriff's Office. Well, we used to use the large cumbersome ankle monitors, and then we went to a smaller ankle strap, if you will, that would test for alcohol and everything else, had the pros and all, so the kind of stuff. And the stuff I witnessed in your facility that had the health care aspect to it, we're still using that kind of stuff, right? So, no. Okay, why not? And that is caught between the politics. And I don't want to get into the politics of the county, but... Right, and that's where it is. That's where it is. So, I have turned it over to the law department. And here's where I am. I'm a profuse proponent of technology, whether it be wearable or in the facility itself, that will come out in the next few months as to a path forward, and I turn it over to the law department. Well, and it's... The technology is a forced multiplier, just like with the district attorney's office, if we have people out there waiting a waiting trial that are being able to be tracked by free world vendors, as we refer to them, then it helps us with manpower, and it also takes some of the pressure off the courts, takes pressure off the prosecutor's office. And so, I think I'm 100% with you on the technology aspect that we have to leverage technology to be a forced multiplier, because I promise you, when you get to the jail this morning, I don't live in this county, but people are not going to be lined up looking for applications to work inside your jail. You are correct. Yeah, I'm correct. And I appreciate that. I want to thank both the groups showing up, and Sheriff, I'll give you the last word, if you have anything else to say. No, I really appreciate the opportunity to shine light on what we are doing as a county, but ultimately how we are servicing and providing service for our customers, both those that are affected by incarceration and those families that extensively are affected by their loved ones. Being light-built. So, we have an obligation to provide care and custody. That's our focus. And so, we certainly appreciate any opportunity to have the conversation because the more we have a conversation, the more we can fix things together. And again, thank you all. Thank you all. And no committee member has anything. We are adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you. Thank you.
