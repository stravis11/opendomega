Now our chaplain this morning is coming to us down in South Georgia. He will be introduced by the lady from the 169th House District, representing Angie Osteen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues, my new colleagues and guests in the galley. It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Pastor Dawn Hadaway. He serves at First Baptist Church in Douglas and has been there since 2019. He previously served at Tabernacle Baptist Church in Carter's Field for 17 years. He also passed her to Manual Baptist Church in Blackshire, Georgia for nine years. He holds degrees from Breton Parker, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and he is the former President, Vice President, and Parliamentarian of the Georgia Baptist Convention. He also served as a trustee for Breton Parker College, shorter university, and the Christian Index. Recently, Dr. Hadaway published the commentary entitled, The Book of Revelation, God's Last Word for the Last Days. In addition to his pastoral responsibilities, he enjoys speaking at revivals, conferences, seminars, and churches throughout the year. He's had the privilege of preaching in England, Greece, Israel, Italy, and St. Vincent in the Grinidines. He's married to my dear friend, Sonja, for 30 years. She's not able to be here today. Together, they have two sons, Nathan, age 27, Daniel, age 26, and Annalaine, who was called to her Heavenly Home at age 21 about two and a half years ago. Please prepare your hearts and minds this morning as your spirits are encouraged and renewed by my pastor and dear friend, Dr. Hadaway. Thank you, Angie. I appreciate that. Mr. Speaker and distinguished members of the House. I am honored to be here with you this morning. Matthew 22 versus 34 through 40 records. Jesus' response to a question that was asked by a lawyer. He was a Pharisee, and this lawyer is not what we would typically think of as an attorney. He was, however, an expert in the law that is Jewish law, in particular, the Mosaic law that is the law of Moses. Jesus responded to this question, knowing that this man was trying to test him, and here's the question. Jesus won as the greatest commandment in the law. So Jesus responded by saying, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and foremost commandment. The second is likened to it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. All these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets. With this statement, Jesus summarized the whole Old Testament law. The purpose of God's law is twofold. First, the commands of God are like a magnifying glass. They give us a close-up view of who God really is. We're able to see his character. We're able to see his holiness. As a matter of fact, Isaiah chapter 55 verses 8 and 9 states, it is like this, for my thoughts are not your thoughts. Nor your ways my ways declares the Lord. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts. Second, God's commands are like a mirror. They show us that we are sinners. For example, let me ask you a question. Have you always loved God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength? Let me ask you this. Have you always loved your neighbor as yourself? Neither have I. This is a serious problem, because James chapter 2 verse 10 tells us, for whosoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all. This is why Paul said in Romans chapter 3 verse 23, For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 6.23 also tells us, for the wages of sin is death. Left to ourselves we are hopeless. This is bad news. Bad news. But thankfully, I have some good news for you this morning, and that is John 3.16 tells us, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Paul added in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21, He made us who knew no sin to become sin for us so that we might be the righteousness of God in him. Did you catch that? So that we might become the righteousness of God in him. So there is hope, there is salvation that has been provided. We cannot be made righteous by keeping the law, by keeping the commandments. We are made righteous by faith in Christ, through his sinless life, his sacrificial death, and his glorious resurrection, we can be forgiven by trusting Christ for salvation. Once we are made righteous, then we are empowered by his spirit to live righteousnessly. The only way we can love God supremely and love each other as ourselves is to totally surrender to Christ. How Davis wrote in 1965 these lyrics, What the world needs now is love, sweet love. It is the only thing that there is just too little love. Well I would say to you this morning, what the world needs now is Jesus. And when Jesus is in our hearts, it will be reflected through our lives. Let's break together. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for all things, especially we are grateful for Christ, who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us, so that we might be saved. Only through him can we genuinely love you and others. Now Lord, we ask that you grant wisdom to these men and women as they serve the people of the great state of Georgia. We humbly pray this in Jesus' name, Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, individual with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Brother Don. We appreciate those words. Doorkypes you may open the doors, members you can join Brother Don in the South any room for a photo, and thank you for his service to us here today. Thank you. Thank you. Our Doctor of the Day today is brought to us by Representative Betsy Holland of the 54th House District. Our Doctor is Dr. Erica Gibson. If you need Dr. Gibson, should be down in the AIDS station to take care of any of your needs. Dr. Gibson, thank you for being here and taking care of the members of the House.

All members, please take their seats. This joint session will come to order. It's clerk. Will you read a resolution? House resolution five, I represent an administration of 104th, a resolution calling a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate for the purposes of hearing a message from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, inviting each other, justice of the Supreme Court, each judge of the Court of Appeals to be present at the joint session and for other purposes. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. It's good to have everyone here this morning to hear a ported message from the Chief Justice. We welcome our members of the Judiciary. Thank you for being here supporting the Chief Justice and we thank you for the work that you do for all Georgians. We recognize a couple of people that import it to getting the work done for all Georgians. First I want to recognize the gentleman on my left, the lieutenant governor, who's doing a great job and we looking forward to working with him and the Senate to get some awesome things done for the people of Georgia, lieutenant governor Bert Jones. A couple of other folks that are crucial to the working of this General Assembly. Dear friend, the President, Pro Tem of the Senate, John Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Thank you for your work, Senator. I appreciate your leadership. Now this is a special day for a number of reasons but even what makes it even more special, it's the birthday of the next person I'm going to introduce. Speaker Pro Tem of this house, a dedicated public servant, a dear friend who's represented her district and the people of this state in its English manner over the years. And her service as a representative but especially a speaker pro Tem, happy birthday speaker Pro Tem, Jane Jones. I knew you were that special recognition on your birthday. It's my great honor now to introduce the Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. Justice Boggs was elected to that position to serve as Chief Justice in 2022 prior to that time, years of service to the people of Georgia in our judicial system. Chief Justice Boggs served as judge on the Court of Appeals of Georgia. He has a superior court judge down in his hometown of White Cross, which is a White Cross judicial circuit. And most importantly, he was trained right here in this house as a member of this house of representatives. He's a graduate of Merce-Lal School and Georgia Southern University. There we go. Go Eagles, just sir. And some really important things that Chief Justice Boggs has been involved in. He served as a member of Georgia Special Counsel on Criminal Justice Reform and the Georgia Criminal Justice Reform Council, meaningful work that he threw his life, he threw his time and effort into that work. Now he is currently a member of Governor Ryan Kemp's, of Georgia's Behavioral Health Reform and Innovation Commission, and serves as chair of the Mental Health Courts and Correction Subcommittee and the Familiar Forces Advisory Council. Among many other things is you'll be one of his passions, his mental health and his work over the years does not go and notice. Thank you Chief Justice. Chief Justice from the important part, Lillison Pierce County, with this wife Heather has been teaching kindergarten for 32 years. And she thought it was more important for her to be with her students today than be here. And I commend her for that. And I salute her for that. Thank you Heather. Along with Justice goes wisdom to administer justice. I know of no one in the judiciary that I've watched over the years does not simplify that virtue. Justice Boggs gets to the point, he gets it right for the people of Georgia working with the other justices. You know, he has a passion for justice. He has a passion for his neighbor. And I thank you very much, evident in his work in the judiciary, and why he's recognized by his peers to serve in this very, very important position in our state. He's done all these things all the while, honoring and respected his fellow men. It's my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce to you all and present to you the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia, Chief Justice Michael P. Boggs. Thank you. Good morning Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, President Pro Tem and my friend John Kennedy. Speaker Pro Tem, Happy Birthday, Jan Jones. You'll excuse me for not singing. Members of the General Assembly, justices and judges who are here with us today in my fellow Georgians. Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. Before I get started, I'd like to ask for a moment of silence if you all will join me for the Chief Judge of the Mountain Judicial Circuit Rusty Smith, who many of you may have heard passed away late last night. Rusty was a personal friend and a wonderful colleague to so many of us and I appreciate the speaker giving him an opportunity for us to honor him in this way, so we please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, both his personal family and his professional family. So thank you for that opportunity. I'm honored to represent the nearly 1600 judges in Georgia who are committed to upholding our oaths of office, to administer justice without respect to person, and to do equal rights to the rich and the poor, and to faithfully and impartially discharge our duties agreeably to the laws of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this state, so help us God. Adherence to this oath promotes the importance of the rule of law and an independent judiciary in our society, and along the way helps build public trust and confidence in our courts. The work to uphold this oath focuses, of course, primarily on deciding cases, the most important work that we do. But that work also extends to effort judges are engaged in across this state to improve the administration of justice. And many of these efforts enjoy your longstanding support for which the judicial branch is eternally grateful. And I'll speak to some of those efforts momentarily, but first, I'm proud to say that despite challenges posed by public health and weather tragedies, and even more serious external threats to our role as a co-equal and independent branch of Georgia's judiciary, our judiciary continues to make good on our promise to faithfully and impartially discharge our duties. And as a result, I'm proud to report that the state of Georgia's judiciary is strong. As public trust in the integrity of government is on a national decline, one bright spot is that public confidence in state courts seems to be more solid. A recent survey has demonstrated that more than half of Americans give state courts a positive job approval rating, and of course this statistic is meaningful, because more than 95% of all court cases nationwide are filed in our state courts. Part of this improved sentiment is, I think, due to the remarkable work Georgia's judges are doing to honor their oath. One way our state courts are leading is by remaining diligent in addressing challenges to our legal system, and this includes examining the impact of generative artificial intelligence. Courts across the world are dealing with this issue, and Georgia courts must be prepared. To this end, I have established a committee led by my colleague, Justice Andrew Pinson, and Court of Appeals judge, Elizabeth Goveal, to study the dangers and opportunities that AI presents for our courts. They will collaborate with a similar committee of the state bar established by our President, Ivy Cattle, and we expect a report from them by this summer. In addition, I talked to you last year about the shortage of court reporters across our state. For much of this year, the Judicial Council Standing Committee on Court Reporter Matters has met with key state holders to discuss this growing crisis. This shortage is felt nationwide and has only gotten worse since I last spoke to you. The consequences are very real because of delayed hearings and trial courts, delayed appeals to our appellate courts, and delayed closure for victims of crime. Now, the Judicial Council is coming to you this year with a balanced proposal that will give trial judges the option of having many, but not all, court proceedings taking down by a digital recording system. The Judicial Council's proposal places no mandate on trial judges to use digital recording, but it does give them the much needed option in order to reduce the amount of time it takes to get necessary records. Court reporters, of course, remain a vital part of our court processes, and we believe this proposal strikes the right balance between protecting the integrity of our court proceedings and transcripts and addressing the very real problems caused from court reporter shortages. Especially one of the things Court of Appeals Judge Ben Land for his leadership on this issue, and of course we urge your support so that we can keep the wheels of justice moving without unnecessary delay. Another recurring thing from last year, and a truly significant issue for Georgia courts and many of your constituents, is the problem of legal deserts. For the last two years, I've told you that there were seven counties all rural with zero licensed lawyers. Sadly, that number has not changed. That leaves more than 30,000 Georgians without access to legal representation in their home counties. For what, in many instances, is likely the most pressing circumstance in their lives, matters like divorce, interventions, and child support, and child custody disputes, and adoptions. It will seemingly routine matters if you have an attorney working for you, but for those who do not, help is almost unattainable, and the consequences can be life altering. I'm committed to leading on this issue, and I'm proud to have other judicial system leaders join me, as we examine potential solutions for narrowing our state civil justice gap. I believe that Georgia should be a national thought leader on this issue, particularly as we've seen Texas, Arizona, and Washington State make great progress. To accomplish this, I created the Supreme Court Study Committee on Legal Regulatory Reform, led by my colleague, Justice Carla Wong-Wit Millen, and Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Dillard. They will work in collaboration with the State Bar of Georgia, judges from various classes of court and attorneys from diverse practice areas across the state, to explore options and innovative opportunities, to use the Supreme Court's constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law, to bolster civil legal services for rural or low-income Georgia. Maybe some of the barriers of accessing justice are caused by, or even made worse, by the way, our court regulates the practice of law. So our challenge, of course, is to do this without undermining the court's duty to protect the public, and not otherwise diminish our state's high standards for legal practitioners in this state. We look forward to the recommendations of this committee, which we hope to receive later this year, as we all seek to improve access to justice for Georgia's. I want to also thank each of you and the legislative branch, who have been great partners in many endeavors to improve our state's justice system. Each of you here today have been instrumental in supporting judicial council initiatives over the last several years that have been transformational for some of Georgia's most vulnerable citizens. Recently, you have approved judicial council funding request for Georgia's Medical Legal Partnership Program, like the one in where county, my home county. This program provides on-site attorneys who assist low-income or senior residents and families with medically fragile children, address their unique and critical legal needs. This ultimately saves lives and tax dollars. Your support of medical legal partnerships is just one example of how important your support is to the state's judicial system. Similarly, over the last several years, you have joined with the judiciary and nonprofit legal services providers, like Atlanta Legal Aid and Georgia Legal Services, in supporting kinship care programs. Those help secure temporary or permanent arrangements for children to be cared for by relatives or close family friends when their biological parents are unable or unwilling to do so. This program helps stabilize families. It lessens the trauma of separation and provides children with supportive services while also saving taxpayer funds. Medical Legal Partnerships and Kinship Care are both the many ways that you all support our courts and...

Honorable Georgians and I want to take this opportunity to personally thank all of you for this critical assistance. In addition to these collaborative initiatives, I'm pleased to report on a landmark initiative that holds the potential to fundamentally improve our justice system. With the support of Governor Kim, Georgia Judicial Leaders are moving forward on a generationally transformative tool for collecting, using, and reporting real-time case information and data. This effort, a statewide case management system for our Georgia Superior and State Courts, is critical to improving the work of our justice system. Currently, as you may know, trial court case management and data are siloed in 159 individual and disparate case management systems that lack common functionality, common definitional standards, and an ability to share information. This can mean that during sentencing, our judges do not have accurate data about defendants, upon which to drive proper case disposition or even diversion. They may not know, for example, whether a defendant standing before them has a prior criminal history in another county. Whether they have ongoing criminal matters and other jurisdictions. Whether they have ever had prior civil mental health commitments, or even whether prior arrest and dispositions are accurately reflected in their criminal histories. I hope we can all agree that a judge trying to accurately fashion an appropriate sentence should not have to rely on the good will of a criminal defendant to volunteer that they are already on probation somewhere else in Georgia, or that they have a history of civil mental health commitments. Of course, bad, missing, inaccurate, and incomplete data available to our state's judges clearly has a real and frightening public safety implication for every Georgia. The governor has funded this project with federal arpa funds, and we're currently working collaboratively with all judicial system partners to ensure that the system will serve stakeholder needs with an aim to have a functional system by the end of this year. We'd like to take this opportunity personally thank the governor for his significant investment in this project, and in so doing, keeping at the forefront the improvements of Georgia courts and the safety of all Georgians. We hope that you share our interest in improved judicial system data, and that you will support this project as needed. In addition to the statewide initiatives, trial courts on the local level are also making great progress in fulfilling their oath to the citizens of Georgia. A shining example is Cobb County's Veterans Accountability Treatment Court program started in 2014 by the late Superior Court Judge Ruben Green, who unfortunately passed away several weeks ago. We mourn the loss of Judge Green, we lift up his legacy of judicial leadership through the creation of this program, which is designed to improve outcomes for veterans in our state's criminal justice system. This program, which is currently presided over by Judge Rob Leonard, is specifically tailored to address issues of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and other mental health issues that are unique to our country's service members. We do this through counseling and additional support services, including job training. As I'm sure Judge Leonard will tell you, the need for veterans courts is dire. 50% of veterans with PTSD in our country do not receive treatment, and there are over 181,000 veterans currently incarcerated in the United States. Both of those 81% had a substance use disorder prior to their incarceration, and a full 25% were identified as mentally ill. Veterans Accountability and Treatment Court's missions is to work to change these dire statistics while also increasing public safety by reducing recidivism, and they are succeeding. Rob 64 veterans have successfully graduated from this 18 month program, and the average recidivism rate is an astounding 7%. I think we could all agree that these veterans have faithfully served our country, and we owe it to them to see that our justice system addresses their service needs appropriately. While all of these various state legislative supported, and of course local initiatives are critical to the health and future of our justice system, it is important to note that they are not the core responsibility of Georgia's courts. That responsibility is to decide cases, and to do so swiftly and fairly and consistently with the law. And on that front, Georgia courts are as strong as ever, despite significant threats to this core mission. For the last several years, we've all noticed an alarming increase in attacks on our courts. Both attacks on decisions, and even physical attacks on judges. It seems that our entire system of justice, a bedrock of our democracy, is under attack. These threats take many forms, from threats posed by disinformation and actual violence, to threats posed by citizens and even at times elected officials, publicly stating their intention to not honor and abide by lawful court decisions. We know you too have experienced physical threats, as we all can recall the instances of swathing that plagued elected officials less than a year ago. These threats simply cannot be tolerated as the new norm in our society, as they threaten the very core of our democracy. And make no mistake, threats against judges are increasing. The United States Marshall Service, which protects our nation's federal courts, reports that threats against federal judges have tripled over the last decade. Up from 179 instances of credible threats in 2019, to 457 in 2023. Of course, we have no agency tracking threats against state judges in Georgia. However, increasing anecdotal evidence does demonstrate that we're continuing to see a precipitous increase in threats against judges, clerks, and court staff. Just last month, bomb threats forced the closure of the Muscovy County Courthouse. Now more than ever, the safety of our state's 1600 judges, as well as our court personnel and the general public who still enter our hallways and courtrooms each day, has become a pronounced concern. It is crucial that our courtrooms are secure, and those who work within them can perform their duties without fear. This means not only upgrading our physical security measures, but also implementing comprehensive training so that security situations can be handled more effectively or better yet prevented altogether. Last summer, we created and implemented training sessions that may be used by judges and you lawmakers across our state to better understand and protect themselves and their families at home or out in their communities. I'd like to take an opportunity to thank my colleague, Justice Sean Ellen LaGrua, and the committee that she chairs for their ongoing work in that regard. I would also like to thank the Georgia Public Safety Training Center and state law enforcement leaders for making all of this possible. I also am very appreciative for the cooperation and support we've received from you all in the legislature and working with this standing committee to add another layer of vital protection through the passage of Senate Bill 508 last session. Thank you especially to the Bill Sponsors, Senator Clint Dixon and Representative Matt Reeves. We greatly appreciate you and thank you all for taking the safety concerns of our judges seriously. Your investment in judicial security is fundamental to maintaining public confidence in our system of government as a whole. We look forward to continued collaboration on our recommendations this session to further refine our approach. In addition to its security, an independent judiciary must be able to attract and retain qualified judges. To that end, we will again be pursuing a plan previously supported by the Judicial Council to improve judicial compensation in Georgia. I'd like to also thank last year Sponsors, Representative Rob Lebert and Senator Bo Hatchett. This year, that same proposal is again sponsored by Representative Lebert, but this year in two separate bills, House Bill 85 will address Superior Court judges and House Bill 86 for statewide judges. We again ask for your continued support of this very important legislation. Equally, as concerning as the attacks and threats of physical violence on our judges are the purposeful and widespread efforts to transform the courts into partisan political actors. It's hard to overstate the danger that such efforts pose to the rule of law if left unchecked. As you know, the rule of law is the simple but powerful idea that all of us, even judges, are bound by the laws that we the people have enacted through our elected representatives. That simple idea is the bedrock of our entire democratic structure and we cannot work without an independent judiciary that has the public's trust and confidence. One way our judiciary is making good on upholding our oaths and doing what we can to further instill public trust in our institution is by supporting legislation that you will see this year to end partisan elections for the remaining few probate and magic court judges who are yet not yet nonpartisan. With the full support of those local courts, we're coming to you again this year asking for your support and assistance in rep defying that issue. We all recognize that the moment judges stop interpreting and applying the law as it is written and start making decisions based on our own policy preferences or worse yet when the public starts believing that's what judges are doing or should be doing, our entire democratic system of government becomes irrepably damaged. Simply put, an independent judiciary with respect for the rule of law keeps us from becoming a society in which the person with the biggest stick is in charge. I'm not saying that no one should ever criticize decisions, legitimate discussions and disagreements about legal analysis and interpretation are and always have been a normal and expected exercise of the freedom of speech that we all hold so dear. But what we can't do as a society is undermine the integrity and legitimacy of the institution every time a court issues a decision that is not aligned with our own partisan policy preferences. That is what we think the law should be judges ought not be judged on whether you like the outcomes of any particular decisions instead they should be judged on whether they have upheld their oaths to faithfully and impartially discharge our duties agreeably to the laws and the common law. The Constitution of the United States so helps us God. As the late Justice Antonin Scalia put it, if you're going to be a good and faithful judge you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time you're probably doing something wrong. So I'm honored to lead a judiciary that upholds this oath by faithfully interpreting and applying the law that we the people have put into effect even if we may not like the outcome in every case. So please help us deliver this simple message. Our state courts are made up of impartial arbiters of the law who have all taken sacred oaths to uphold the Constitution and to defend the rule of law. And our limited role as judges is to interpret the law as it is written and to apply it to resolve disputes between the parties before us not to serve as a super legislature. As long as the people of Georgia understand and trust that our judiciary is faithfully carrying out that limited rule the rule of law will remain secure. In closing, I want to express the entire judiciary's sincere gratitude for your willingness to provide assistance to us so that we may continue to improve the Fair and Swift administration of justice and uphold our sacred oaths. Thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today. May God continue to bless us in this great state of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, always very powerful and to the point we were looking forward to working with you in the courts to ensure that we protect the rights of all Georgians. And as we've always had a great relationship we look forward to continuing and we certainly look forward to the conversation. Thank you so much for your remarks today. Welcome again to the House. We appreciate all the work that you all do from every day for the people of Georgia. So thank you. You're welcome here at any time. Thank you all.

As you all know, cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of women and since 2004, the American Heart Association, signature women's initiative, Go Red for Women, has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps in women's greatest health threat, which is cardiovascular disease. And every year here in the Georgia legislature, we come together to bring awareness. So next Thursday, which is February 6, we're asking our legislators to wear red and we will have the American Heart Association representatives here with us. And for the community in those you legislators that will still be in town on Friday, we are asking you to join us for lunch here at the Capitol at 12 o'clock where we will have the official Go Red for lunch events. And I want to leave you all with this, as I'm getting my low technology in place. Some of you know that I've survived a heart attack and a stroke. But one of the things that I wasn't clear about were the signs. And so we know sometimes women, those signs are a little different, but I want to share this with you. If you have any of these signs, call 911 and get to the hospital as soon as you can. One, you have sudden numbness, a weakness of your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body. Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding. Y'all, I was driving my car on the phone with somebody in my speech was blurred, was kind of messed up. And his friend, I was like, your voice is sounding weird. I say it does, doesn't it? And I just kept driving, was headed to the house, but y'all, I was having a stroke. So don't be like me. There's trouble, sudden trouble, seeing a blurred vision and wonder both of your eyes, sudden trouble, walking, distance, this, lots of balance and coordination. Those are some of the signs of you having a stroke. Signs of you having a heart attack. If you have uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, full disobey, I know sometimes we think it's indigestion, but if it starts lasting too long, guys, go get some help. Again, pain or discomfort in one of your arms, shortness of breath and without chest comfort. And one of the signs that, even my cardiologist, we had to chat about, but cold sweat and nausea. If you have any of those, please, please, please, call 911 because we need all of you, right? So next Thursday, we wear red, right? And then Friday, you guys are coming back to the Capitol Hill, lunch with us with red. So if you don't have two red outfits, go shopping this weekend. Thank you, I yield a well. Thursday a week, right? Thursday a week, we're red. Thank you, Representative Carter. Thanks for reminding us. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to ask you to give the lady in this coming to the well and her friends, your attention and please stand, Representative Lynn Smith and several folks are coming to the well to honor a life. Good afternoon, Representative. Good morning, everyone. And as happens to so many of us, it's a very sad occasion that I, in the Cowardy County delegation, Representative David Jenkins, Josh Bonner, Robert Dawson, Lydia Glaze, and in spirit, Josh Bonner, as well as the chair of our Public Safety Committee, Clint Crowe. This is such an unusual story and pain that the family is feeling because it was so unexpected. The title in our newspaper was, there is just no sense in it. And briefly, Cowardy County, excuse me, all, Cowardy County Fire Bataingee, Bert Cawson was tragically killed last Sunday evening in Alabama while assisting a stranded motorist. This is a good Samaritan. With no cell surface in the area, Cawson and the driver decided to walk to near my home to seek assistance. When the two men approached the driveway, the homeowner came out shooting with no warning. Both Cawson and the driver were struck. Cawson collapsed and died. The other person also was injured. Again, there's no sense in this. But that's where prayer comes in. And so today, the funeral starts at 1 o'clock with a procession and then the service. So let's lift up our prayers for my community in this family. And I think a couple of people who name Cawson want to say something. Good afternoon. We stand here today to honor a great man. Chief Barc Cawson lived the life of the ethos of service above self. The night he was tragically killed, he wasn't dispatched, he wasn't in uniform, he wasn't on the payroll, he just saw somebody who needed help and that's all he needed and he provided help. He was a servant leader and it can't be...

overstated how great the impact on the Cowie to County Sheriff's Department is. He mentored those young firefighters every day to follow in his footsteps and his example and that's you just can't replace that. I had an honor to work with him. Our air ambulance base down there is flying in their service this afternoon to render his honor and it honors for him in the funeral. So I pray for his family, his brothers and sisters at the Cowie to County Sheriff's Department, all those young firefighters that depended so much on his leadership and I conclude my remarks. Thank you very much. Thank you. If you all just have a moment of silence for us, thank you. Amen. Thank you all. Our prayers for the delegation who knew the chief for the family, for the community and our consent, circumstances to the family and prayers for them these tough days and weeks and months and years to come for the tragic loss. Thank you members. That completes our afternoon orders. We have several announcements. I know already leader, are you ready? I'd like for folks, make sure everyone here. Members, if you will, give your attention to the lady in the well. Just hold just a minute. Most important announcement representative, you glee is recognized for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, this afternoon at four o'clock, we're going to have a ceremony to unveil a portrait of our former colleague, Calvin Smirie. Calvin Smirie served this house for more than 47 years and he's only going to be the seventh African American to have a portrait in this entire capital. So I wish that you would come and help us honor him today. He's so excited about it. It's going to occur right here in the chambers or you can come and go to your regular seat. But let's show him love this afternoon and I'm excited for the opportunity that he's been given. So thank you, Mr. Speaker and everybody, we'll see you at four. It's going to be great to welcome the dean back. We're looking forward to it. We'll enjoy this if you can. Representative Jasmine Clark is recognized for an announcement. Representative Clark, give the lady your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today at one o'clock, the Gwyneth delegation will meet in room 502 and CLOB for a delegation meeting as well.
