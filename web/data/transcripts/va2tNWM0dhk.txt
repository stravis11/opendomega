It is now time for our morning devotion.
All senators please take your seats and cease all conversations.
I would ask that the doorkeeper secure the chambers at this time.
I now recognize a good senator from the six district to lead us in our
Pledge of Allegiance and introduce us to our pastor of the day.
Good morning, colleagues.
Let's start with the pledge allegiance.
Pledge allegiance to the flag, the United States of America,
and to the Republic for which it stands,
morning nations, we have indivisible,
with liberty and justice for our own.
Now the Georgia flag.
Where did the allegiance to the Republic
and the principle for which it stands?
It was meant by that it's an honoration for courage.
Good morning colleagues, it is my honor to introduce to everyone the Reverend
Catherine Booth Olson, whose church, Northside Church, is in State Senate District 6.
She's been on staff at Northside Church since 2006 and was ordained
Deacon in the North Georgia Conference in 2010. She's gone to some great institutions across
this great state. She earned two associates degrees at Young Harris College before obtaining
a BS in education at Valdosta State University and a master of divinity at Emory University.
She's married to Gordon and has four young adult and teenage stepchildren.
She also has a cat named Atticus, who she found and rescued in the Northside Church building.
Please join me in welcoming Reverend Catherine Booth Olson.
It is a joy and privilege to be with you this morning.
you for your service and your dedication. I am aware that you have a full day of work
and I have a senior pastor who is a commitment to a strong sense of timeliness. So I know I have
five minutes. It is true I grew up in Evans, Georgia and have covered most of the state from
young Harris to Valdosta to here in the city of Atlanta. I've lived in Cobb to Cabb and Fulton
in County and now live in the 48th district.
I will keep my remarks brief.
I'm gonna share a few lessons I learned with a group
of high school students as we were stranded in Colorado
for two additional days last week.
We got snowed in.
And I must admit, I am not one who does well with snow.
I'm a Georgia peach.
I'm made for hot Atlanta.
I thrive with hot cocoa and warm blankets.
I need ear warmers and I don't know how those
were unhoused do well.
I want it warm and not cold.
And if it was up to me, when it's under 40, we'd go home.
We'd shut down from OSA January and February,
but that is not my decision.
So last Monday, as we went to leave from the YMCA camp
with 21 high schoolers, we thought it would take
about two hours to get to Interstate 70.
Unfortunately, it took seven hours.
We had whiteouts, we saw spinning out cars.
I made prayers to the Lord God Almighty
that I may never be able to cash in on.
I ask God to keep these sweet precious children alive.
I worried about our safety.
I worried if we would be sleeping in the cold.
I thought I might be sharing a van
with some very smelly teenage boys.
And yet, seven hours later,
we made it to the inner state.
Only to find out it was closed.
And we would not be making it to Denver.
And we would not be joining our flight that was leaving.
And as a result, we started calling travel agents
and parents.
I started working with teenagers who were crying
because they would not be missing school.
And no, that is not why they were crying.
They were upset because they would be missing tryouts
and friends and boyfriends and girlfriends
and they were stuck with some people they really liked
and some they were trying to learn to like.
And so two more days in these snowy mountains
we would stay.
And slowly we found a new hotel to stay in
and we were able to order cheap pizza
and they learned that there was a hot tub
And maybe all would be okay.
And as we got to the evening,
I was able to ask our kids,
what were the highs and what were the lows?
And where did they see God in the midst of a day
that had gone very, very wrong?
And I, the pastor, stopped and listened and got wisdom
from a bunch of high schoolers.
And they shared with me where they saw God
in the midst of the day.
Maybe you too will have days
that will go very, very wrong.
It is my prayer that this session will be easy and breezy.
It is my prayer that you will do good, hard work,
that you will make a difference on behalf
of your constituents.
But maybe sometimes things won't go as you planned either.
So let me share with you the wisdom they shared with me.
What makes hard days better days?
A good night's sleep.
Snacks.
Bring snacks with you.
Friends who can make you laugh, knowing that they're adults who are working on your behalf.
Faith in a creator who is at work in the world at all times, and who never leaves you,
nor forsakes you.
Knowing that you can pray at all times and that there are others who are praying for
you, that you can turn your eyes to the heavens, just like the psalmist says, and that it is
okay to turn off your phones and go and play.
friends, you may need that same very advice this session. Maybe you will need a
little rest when the session gets long. Maybe you'll just need a head to bed.
Maybe you'll need snacks. Maybe you'll need a lean into your friends. Maybe you'll
need to ask and seek wise counsel. Maybe you'll need to know that there are other
adults who care for you. Maybe you'll need to trust in God when you don't know
how God is working in the world.
Maybe you need to know that there are church members,
constituents and even strangers who are praying for you.
Maybe you need to stop and turn off your phone
and go outside and get in nature.
How will you know that you are okay
in the midst of all that is going on around you?
Sometimes things go wrong friends.
Sometimes you will do everything right,
just like we thought we had, and it still doesn't go as planned.
I want you to know that even when you do everything you're supposed to do, that God is still
for you, that God is not against you, that you are loved and that there are people praying
for you, and that sometimes there is wisdom in the words of high schoolers, rest, eat
your snacks, turn off your phones, and go and pray.
And if you give it just enough time,
either the session will end or God will show up
in unexpected ways.
Let us pray.
Gracious and loving God,
we give you things that you show up
when we don't expect it.
Sometimes life is a storm and sometimes life is easy.
O God, we ask that you would give us eyes to see
and ears to hear and a heart to receive.
And when we forget,
surround us with high schoolers or wiser adults
to have eyes to look to you,
help us to trust, to believe and to know
that we are loved and we are never alone.
And the name of the one who made the mountains in the snow
and the name of the one who made this very capital,
we give you thanks.
Amen.
Thank you.

attention.

very special guests today and I would like to call on the senator from the
42nd to introduce our special. Thank you mr. President colleagues it's my
distinct honor to welcome to the chamber this morning as our doctor of the day

Good morning. I really enjoy coming here and serving you guys because I know how
hard you work and I know what you do and all I ask is that you in your
legislative effort that you keep health care in mind and in particular urgent
care. I've been in Urgent Care for a long long time and you want to appreciate
how important Urgent Care is and just think of what COVID would have been
light without urgent care centers. I'm sure many of you have been to an urgent
care and hopefully you've recovered well. But again, I really want to say thank
you for what you do. It does not go unnoticed. Thank you again.

We have some special guests here today and light the secretary to read the caption, please.
Senate Resolution 441 by Senators Kennedy of the 18th and others, a resolution recognizing
and commending Marcus Woods and for other purposes.
Whereas during his distinguished career, Marcus Woods has consistently demonstrated exceptional
skill, leadership and commitment to it in his role as a football referee, where he has
long represented the state of Georgia, and whereas he discovered his love for officiating
football in 2007, and whereas his collegiate officiating career has led him to work during
significant games such as the ACC Championship, Fiesta Bowl, Peach Bowl, and the 2022 Army
Navy game. And whereas he has further refereed, the College Football Playoff Bowl games and
will serve as the main referee for the 2024 College Football National Championship.
And whereas it is abundantly fitting and proper that the outstanding accomplishments of the
remarkable and distinguished Georgian be appropriately recognized. Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Senate that the members of this body recognize and commend Marcus Woods for his many years of
efficient, effective, and exemplary service as a football referee, as well as extend best wishes
for his continued success. That completes the order, Mr. President.
Now, calling the senator from the 18th to introduce our special guest.
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning again, friends and colleagues. I am really honored to
to commend two distinguished Georgians that are behind me.
Mr. Marcus Woods and Jamal Shears
for their work in officiating the 2023 NCAA
College Football National Championship,
as you heard from the resolution
about some of their great work on the field.
But I've got with me today, Marcus Woods,
who's a native of Atlanta.
He began his officiating career in 2007.
He served as a referee and center judge
in the ACC since 2017.
Outside of his work in the ACC, Marcus has officiated notable games such as the Army Navy
game in 2022.
The Peach Bowl in 2019 and the Fiesta Bowl in 2018.
Most recently, Marcus was served as a head referee in the college football playoff national
championship game, which took place this year in Houston.
We've also got Jamal Shears, who has been in the football officiating space his entire
adult life.
from officiating in high school games to multiple collegiate conferences including Gulf
South, CIP, and the current conference of the ACC.
While he works in nearly every position he specializes as a side judge, he has had the
opportunity to operate in some high stakes games y'all, including the 2023 ACC Championship,
the 2022 CFP National Championship,
the Army Navy, and over four NCAA Bowl games.
I want to thank my dear friend, Judge Tripp Self,
who many of you know, a federal judge down in Macon
that is watching this on the television,
who brought this to my attention,
these great friends of his and great Georgians,
as well as I understand a lot of officiating friends
and colleagues at these two men behind have
that are watching them receive this honor today.
they've got their beautiful wives with them where are they they're beautiful right right there
who have come and so I just want to express my appreciation and what a treat it is to have these
two Georgians in our capital today please give them a special welcome I'm going to ask them to come
up and if they want to say a brief word we'd love to hear from them first we want to thank Lieutenant
Governor Jones and Senator McKinney for this honor and the opportunity to stand before
you guys and we want to say that we really truly are honored to represent the state of
Georgia and the Atlantic Coast Conference and what we do.
Once again, just thank you Senator McKinney and Lieutenant Jones for this great recognition
and it's such an honor honor to be represented for the state of Georgia.
Thank you.

We've got some very fine guests here with us from Richmond County don't have a resolution
so to speak but they don't need a resolution because these are veterans of our fine state
and country and and we always are glad to have have them down and if y'all were to give
us your attention. I'd like to call on the senator from the 22nd the minority
whip here to introduce our special guests here. Thank you Mr. President. My
honor to introduce the greater gust of veterans who are here today who
represent over 675 years of military service representing the Army Navy
Air Force Marines. All many have served combat tours including Vietnam, Desert
storm, Somalia, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom.
We also have a member here from our Watt Corps who is Vailman Lions, and we have participants
who are with me today.

Force, Augusta Commissioner, current Augusta Commissioner, Alvin Mason, United States Army,
American Legion State Commander, Melvin Warren, Serden Desert Storm, United States Army,
American Legion District Commander Thomas Pinkney,
and Patriot Guard, Ryder State Commander Leon McLean.

also to talk about a veteran's cemetery.
And please welcome our guests as they come here today.
Are you veteran of the United States military?
Thank you.
Applause.
Thank you, Senator.
It's an honor to represent Augusta and the Augusta region.
I want you to know we're great and delighted to have the veterans here today.
We have 40 veterans here today serving all branches of our military serving you and serving
the citizens of Georgia and the citizens of our nation.
You'll find on your desk today a little flyer that describes a project that we've been working
on for a few years now.
Four years Bob Keesney straight on this.
We have a need for a veteran's cemetery in Augusta, Georgia where there are some challenges
because we don't qualify for federal funding and we're trying to find a way to honor our
veterans by allowing them to be interred in their home community.
So if you would please listen to them as they advocate for their needs and let's see
how we can support the veterans of Georgia but especially the veterans of the CSRA.
I'm grateful for the service.
Thank you gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Good morning.
My name is Don Clark.
First of all, I'd like to thank the governor for allowing us the time to speak.
I definitely want to thank all of our senators who represent our region.
My name is Don Clark.
I am a humble representation of the men and women that
represent those that proudly serve their country throughout
all different types of service.
I'm proud to say that we as a community stand tall in
supporting our men and women of the armed forces.
I would like to submit my thank you to the Senate for
approving the initial million dollars when we submitted the application to go forward
for the cemetery.
But I would also submit a request, a humble request, that the work is not done.
We've been carrying this for some time now, and with your support and your collective
leadership, we're looking to make this a reality for our area to ensure that we have a very
proud, a very sacred place to fulfill the fundamental need of our veterans and their families
to lay to rest in their area of home and locate a veteran cemetery.
Men and women in the gallery, I thank you all for your collective service.
I thank you for your service that you continue to render to our community.
Men and women of the Senate Chamber, I thank you all for your service that you render to
the state, and I hope that we have your full consideration support as we move forward in
this process.
Thank you.

All right, are there any unanimous consents, Chair here, or none?
Does any senator which rise on a point of personal privilege, the point of personal
privilege, unanimous consent. Okay. State.
For unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 26.
Ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 26.
You scared me back there, Senator. I thought it's something
important right here.
It is to the senator of the 26.
All right, yeah, without objection,
the Senate from 26. Excuse. So what does any Senator wish to rise on a point of personal
privilege? Recognize the senator from the 8th.
Thank you, Mr. President. Just wanted to remind everybody that today from 430 to 630 at
the Depot, the Georgia Food Industry Association and the Georgia Beverage Association are having
their reception. Hope y'all will come. That's Ms. Kathy. Senator Jack Hill was actually
on the board when Ms. Kathy started representing the grocery industry in this state. So,
y'all please come and have fun with us and appreciate you, Ms. President, I yield the well.
Does any other senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?
from the 43rd.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today is Healthy Mother's Healthy Babies,
Maternal Awareness Day at the Georgia State Capitol,
but they will be celebrating at the Presbyterian Church.
It is also a doula day at the Capitol, room 125,
where you can meet a doula and learn more
about their scope of practice.
It is imperative that we, as a state of Georgia,
not only address Medicaid expansion,
but address maternal mortality in this assembly
in this chamber. Why? Because Georgia has the second highest rate of maternal mortality
of 48.4 percent per one, I'm sorry, 48.4 per 100,000 Georgians. The maternal mortality
rate report shows that this is the highest concern and it is an adequate follow-up of cardiovascular
symptoms and pregnant women and particularly in black women. Failure to recognize and treat
hypertension or hemorrhages soon enough has been an issue. Researchers have reported
that in more than one-third of cases they were unsure of where maternal or paternal care
began for mothers and confirmed that some who died received more prenatal care, no prenatal
care at all. I'm sorry. Black mothers in Georgia are more likely to die from
pregnancy as they are in the as they are in the rest of the United States and
especially in states with rural areas. Again, let's support change in the
maternal mortality rate here in Georgia, expand Medicaid, and meet a doula
today in room 125. Thank you, Mr. President, I y'all the well.
Does any of the senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege?
You have before you a consent calendar of privilege resolutions, does any senator wish to remove
resolution on the consent calendar?
Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar?
Chair, here's none.
The resolution of the consent calendar is adopted.
Oh, are there any motions that were drawn and commit?
You
We just had some special guests come into the chambers today and Senator from the 30
second wanted to recognize them and I wanted us to recognize them as well.
We have the council general from the country of Japan, a great friend and of ours here
not only in the country but this state and we are happy to have the council general here
today, and I recognize the senator from the 30-second to introduce our special guest.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Today, if you haven't noticed, is Japan Day at the Capitol, so there are vendors outside
inside, and then we are very happy to have the Council General from Japan, Mio Maeda,
his wife with us today and along with Senator from what district, District 40, we're
co-chairs, Senate co-chairs of the Japan caucus, and former representative Tom Taylor also
represents the Japanese group.
And I probably don't have to tell you all this, but Japan's had a great big impact on
Georgia's economy. We have 885 companies that have offices in Georgia with a complete economic
benefit of around 9.75 billion. And I've had an opportunity to visit Japan, but if you haven't,
you can get a really good feel for the culture by going to Japan Fest, which is held at the
Guneck County, Guest, South Arena, and this year, I believe it's September 14th and 15th.
So with that, we did do a resolution that I will present to the Council General, and
I'd love for you all to welcome him to the Chamber to give a few remarks.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, what to be honest, I didn't expect that I have to make a speech.
I didn't prepare anything, but anyway.
Thank you so much, and I also thank you all of you
for your continued support to the Japanese companies
and Japanese people here.
And I do, well, as I mentioned, as you mentioned,
this is a 50th anniversary of the establishment
of our office.
And we are looking forward to, we are
We are determined to continue our effort to enhance and expand the relations between Japan
and Georgia, the state of Georgia, and we are looking forward to continue support from
all of you.
Thank you very much.
