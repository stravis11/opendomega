And it's reapportionment and redistricting committee meeting.
This morning, we are going to hear from the minority leader and she will be presenting
her plan.
After that, we will be taking action on a map for the public.
Thank you all for being here.
you to everyone who came yesterday and offered your input. We're not having public comments
today, but if you if you haven't had an opportunity to speak, you can still submit your comments
online. We review those constantly and I've even as soon as early as this morning, I was
checking those comments. So I appreciate everyone who's taken the time to do that, taken
the time to have your voice heard, and we will continue to
log those comments today as well. As we do, all of our Senate
committee meetings will open up with a word of prayer. So I
would like to ask, um, leader Gooch, would you be willing to
open a separate word of prayer? What number? Number 10, good
hit. Our heavily followed, we come to you this morning, God,
we asked for your guidance, we asked for your wisdom. Lord,
as we seek what's best for the citizens of Georgia.
God, we ask for your blessings around our state
and around our nation and our world.
God, as we look for peace throughout our people,
the lands.
Be with us as we travel through the day
as we go home to our families.
And your holy name we pray, amen.
Thank you.
So, leader, yes.
Leader, is there a reason why we're not having public comments?
We had public comment yesterday and passed around the sheet
during the meeting to allow anyone the opportunity
to sign up.
But if people are here today, that we're here yesterday,
are they allowed to give public comments?
Everyone who signed up yesterday, let's give a opportunity.
But you're saying there's no public comments today?
Yes.
And yesterday I said that the public comment was closed,
The public comment portion for yesterday's meeting so today's meeting is a new meeting a new day new maps
And I'm asking about public comments today for this meeting
Yeah, so yesterday we received public comment and we closed public comment today
We've taken the time to hear the minority leaders
and her plan will have discussion amongst the committee
and anyone who hasn't had the opportunity can submit
their comment on the public portal.
So, Madam Chair, we have...
I still understand.
...Basini.
It's a...
I'm sorry.
Is that my understanding that we have two processes
that we have following?
no no ma'am there's not two processes well yesterday you had public comment
you closed the public comment for yesterday and today is a new day with the
new map and so we should follow the same process and it's for the people to
have a voice for the members of the committee to ask questions at the
appropriate time so that there's you're not cutting off debate of the
committee members, you're just not having another public hearing today.
The committee members will be given ample time to ask questions and make comments, but
it's not a public hearing for the public input.
That portion of the process was done yesterday.
Today's meeting is to follow the agenda that is here before us, and then members will
be given plenty of time to discuss either map and have plenty of time for questions and
answers.
right. But we didn't have questions because we didn't give in
for yesterday though. So is it like part two is for committee
members because we didn't come in yesterday. We had no time to
dive on yesterday. Are you as member of this committee? I
am. You'll be given plenty of chances for questions. Okay,
how about if how many people who were not here yesterday?
Need would like to stop to make public comment. I don't have
the Weepbook Committee.
You spoke yesterday.
I'm not on today's map.
So we reserved our testimony for today's map
until we think today's case.
So after the minority leader presents her map,
we will open up public comment for anyone
who didn't have the opportunity to speak yesterday.
So this real quick, you had three people raise their hand?
Well, there was one.
Yeah, one who wasn't here, who didn't speak yesterday.
So it's still a different process.
You can pick and choose who can speak.
You didn't do that yesterday.
You didn't pick and choose the people in the public that
would speak.
But today, you get to pick and choose.
And today, you get to ask the committee to ask questions.
But yesterday, the committee didn't get to ask questions,
because we will prepare to ask questions.
Yeah, yeah.
Madam Leader, yesterday you were given the opportunity
to present your map and you chose to do that today.
Yesterday we heard from everyone who signed up
to present their map, to present their public comment
yesterday.
Today I'm allowing anyone who wasn't able to present yesterday
who wasn't here to make their public comment
and we'll be happy to take those public comments then.
Madam Chair, people that made public comment yesterday
commented on a different bill today, it's a new bill and they should have the
opportunity to comment on the new bill. Okay, thank you. Members of the
public yesterday from commenting on the map that's being presented today.
Madam Chair, you released your map on Monday. On Monday, when was this map
released. I believe it was Tuesday. It was posted Tuesday.
So members of the public had the opportunity to comment on both maps as they were both
publicly available prior to yesterday. That's correct. That's correct. Okay.
I think Madam Chair, some of the comments that were made by the public yesterday in fact
addressed the map of the Democrats because it had been previously released and was in
in the public for at least maybe two days.
Okay, so at this point in time,
I think it's appropriate for the minority leader
to present your mail.
Thank you Madam Chair.
And good morning everyone.
I'm Senator Gloria Butler.
I'm the minority leader of the Georgia Senate Democrats.
Today we are here to discuss the Democratic proposal
for redrawing the Senate's legislative map
in accordance with the federal court order,
and more importantly, in accordance with the Voting Rights Act.
The Democratic caucus recognizes
that fair maps are crucial to ensuring
that every vote in Georgia counts equally,
and that no voter in Georgia is subject to discrimination
in the election process.
Therefore, we have not taken the federal court's order lightly.
Last month, Judge Jones issued a 516-page order,
which found that the 2021 map proposed and passed
by Senate Republicans violated the Voting Rights Act
and discriminated against white voters.
Specifically, the court identified Senate District 10,
16, 17, 25, 28, 30, 34, 35, 43, and 44, as the areas in which the map violated the Voting
Rights Act.
To remedy this violation, the court ordered that the Senate enact a map that includes
two additional majority black districts, specifically in the area identified by the court.
to be clear. The Court's order contained two directives. First, that two new
majority black districts be created. And second, that the new majority black
districts be created in the vote dilution area that the Court identified as
not providing black voters with an equal opportunity to elect the
candidates of their choice.
The Republican proposal for a new Senate map
does not follow the court's directive.
In truth, the map proposed by Republicans
fails to comply with the Voting Rights Act
and continues to dilute the voting power of black voters
in South Metro, Atlanta.
In many ways, the Republican proposal
is a hoax.
In the Pacific area where the court found voting rights
violation, the majority's proposal
moved nearly as many black residents
out of existing majority districts, black districts,
as it moves into majority black districts.
This means that a net of only approximately 3,000
black voters in the vote dilution area
identified by the court were moved into majority black districts.
Republicans try to cover up their social smoking mirrors.
They attempt to obscure what has been done in this map
by reassigning the district numbers of multiple existing
incumbents, but you can't obscure the truth.
The Republican Proposes dilute black voting power just like the 2021 Republican map did.
The Republican Proposes does little, if anything, to improve black voter's ability to elect
candidates of their choice.
Given this, the Democratic caucus presents an alternative map that it believes should
be adopted instead because it actually complies with the Voting Rights Act, and specifically
complies with the Federal Court's order.
I will begin by describing how our proposal complies with the Federal Court's order,
and expands Black voters' opportunity to elect candidates of their choice as ordered
by the Court.
Now, to start, the Democratic map does exactly what the court
orders demand.
It draws two additional majority black districts
in the vote dilution area, where the courts
specifically found violations of the Voting Rights Act.
In our proposal, the 16th and 17th districts,
a new majority black districts, and all
of the proposed changes in our map
are made in the area identified by the court.
In that area, our proposal brings almost 150,000
black residents that currently live
in non-majority black districts
and to majority black districts.
Our proposal does not move any black voters
out of majority black districts
and two non-majorative black districts.
Additionally, by focusing only the area identified by the court,
the Democratic proposal leads 46 Senate districts, exactly the same,
and only modified the boundaries of 10 Senate districts.
That is, the 10th Senate districts identified by the court.
by comparison, the Republican proposal
modifies the boundaries of 15 Senate districts.
Of the 15, only eight of them were identified
by the court as diluting black voting power.
Further, the Democratic proposal does not
pair any incumbents.
It also does not unnecessarily change district numbers
where district boundaries have not dramatically changed.
Keeping the same district numbers as the 2021 maps
will decrease voter confusion in the 2024 election cycle
and increase voter confidence.
Additionally, there will be little to no voter confusion
in the 46th district that have not been changed.
The first district that the court specified, District 10, this existing majority black district
maintains is the cab and henry core and adds a portion of Rockdale County that is becoming
increasingly diverse and was previously in the 17th District.
district has a black gap of 63 percent. District 16, this district becomes a new
majority black district to comply with section 2 of the VRA and the
judges order. It retains this Northwest Fayette Corps and adds sections of
Northeast Fayette County that were previously packed into District 34. The
The district also includes portions of South Fulton County from the PAC District 35 and
Northeast Calveter County from the crack district 28 along the I-85 quarter, including all
parts of the cities of Union City, Fairburn, and Noonan.
Compared to the old District 16, it removes non-section two areas of fae, spawning pike
and Lamar counties.
The district has a blackwap of 52%.
District 17, from 2011 to 2021, District 17 existed in parts of Henry Newton and Rockdale
counties.
of the district's population was in Henry County.
During that period, Henry County's white population decreased
by 19% and the black population increased by 60%.
The prior district had become a 42% black opportunity
district that was overpopulated.
It was possible to create a new majority black just
from within the core of the existing district.
Instead, during the 2021 redistricting,
the state cracked black voters in the 17th district,
moving 19,000 black residents in Henry County
into the 25th, where they did not have an opportunity
to elect a candidate of their choice.
rural counties that are not communities of interests with Henry, including parts of
Walton County and all of Morgan County were jerrymanded in to achieve population.
I'll plan news voters in southwest Henry County out of the packed
chinch district into our own district. This proposed 17 districts includes voters in the
cities of Stockbridge, Macdonough, Hampton, and Locust Grove along the I-75 corridor.
It also adds a sizable black population in Butts County further along the I-75 corridor.
The newly created district is compact and has a 51% black gap.
District 25, from 2011 to 2021, District 25 was a mostly rural district southwest of
that Lana suburbs.
It was not a black majority district or opportunity
district.
In the 2021 redistricting, the state
jared mandated the 25th district to take black voters
from the old proposed 17th district
to prevent those voters from having the opportunity
to elect the candidate of their choice.
We cure this district in a configuration, more
like its original configuration and respect in communities of interests.
All of Baldwin, Jones, Putnam, Jasper, and Morgan counties are contained in the district.
Mostly rural portions of Alton and Newton County are also included to achieve population.
A small portion of Macon Bibb County is included in the existing district, while we would
But not include this portion if we were redrawing our districts.
This part was left unchanged due to the judge's mandate to only focus on affected areas.
The black gap is 27%.
District 28, the existing 28 district is 25% black and not an influence district.
Stanford Black Population in Central Caluity County, South
Fulton County, and Southwest Douglas County were cracked
and placed into this district.
Those black populations were removed into New District
16 and 35 to satisfy the court's order.
This district picks up portions of Fayette and Spaldon
County and all of Pike and Lamar Counties.
That came from the old district 16,
but a not section to areas.
This district loses herd county
and part of Northwest Cowheeda County
to district 30 because of population shifts.
These parts are not section to areas.
The final district 28 includes most of the southern part
of Cowheeda and Fayette counties.
most of Spalding County except for the parts of the city
of Griffin and all of Pike and the Mar Counties.
The Black Vap of the District is 14%.
District 30, the existing District 30 is not a section
to district and included all of Carroll County
and Hurd County and portions of Douglas and Pauling County.
Black voters in Northwest Douglas County and South East
Paulton County had their ability to select the candidate
of their choice impacted by being cracked into existence
District 30.
These voters were moved out of District 30
into New District 35 due to population loss
from the Section 2.
From the Section 2 mandated changes,
District 30 added all of Hurd County and the North West
portion of Cal Wheeler County, the Blackvap is 16%.
District 34, our plan maintains the Clayton County Corps
of this district.
Most of Clayton County, west of Tower Boulevard,
is included in this district, including
portions of the south part of the county
that were previously in District 44.
We removed the portion of Fayette County from this district.
That area was packed in and formed the core
of the new VRA complaint district 16,
compliant district 16.
To achieve population and help as many areas as possible
in the affected area of the map,
comply with the judge's order.
We also added portions of the city of Griffin
and Northwest Paulton County
that are plurality, plurality, black.
This district remains a majority, a majority black district.
District 35, existing district 35 includes parts
of Southfoot and County,
and the eastern half of Douglass County.
previously black voters were packed into this district.
Neighboring areas with substantial black populations
like Weston Douglas County, South Paulton County,
Northeastern County to County,
and North Weston Fayette County
were cracked into non-VIA compliant districts.
Heavily black portions of South Fulton
along the 85 quarter were removed to create part of the new
core of District 16.
All of Douglas County was consolidated into this district.
They were previously in either 28 or 30.
Portions of South Paulton County that were previously in
District 30 were added to achieve population deviation.
The new district has a black gap of 55%.
District 43.
The existing district 43 contained a portion of Southeast
to care, all of Rockdale, and a portion of Newton County.
A substantial black population in Newton County was cracked
and placed into existing district 17
to prevent these voters from being able
to pick the candidate of their choice.
We place the majority of these Newton County voters
back into District 43, where they can exercise
their voting rights.
The district retains half of Rockdale County
and east of I-20 due to population deviation
and moves elsewhere to comply with the court order,
the other half of Rockdale County was moved into District 10, another section to District.
The new District is 61% light valve. District 44. This District retains its existing
core in the Cab County. The proud configurations of Clayton County more centrally. This District
included most of the right east side of the county.
Clayton is now split more along Tara Boulevard
and this district has most of the county
that is east of Tara Boulevard,
including the cities of Forest Park and Mauro.
The district is more compact.
It no longer goes all the way to the bottom
of Clayton County's southern Panhandle area.
the new district is 67% Black Val.
As you all can see, the Democratic proposal creates two
majority Black districts only in the vote dilution area
identified by the federal court.
Under our proposal, more than 100,000 Black voting age
residents in the vote dilution districts
would now be able to exercise their Constitution of Right
to vote in a new district 16 and 17
or by being added to existing districts like 10,
34, 35, 43, and 44.
In the Republican proposal, a net of fewer than 4,000
like voting age residents in the vote dilution districts
would achieve new status
because the new districts were created primarily from areas
that were largely already in majority black districts.
Oh, in the case of substantial population
in Douglas and Newton County were previously
in majority black districts, but were cracked
into non-voting rights act compliant districts.
The Republican proposal achieves additional majority black
districts by packing and reconfiguring
non-affected areas elsewhere on the map.
If the Republican plan passes,
the fellow records finding of Dixon French,
Dixon,
Dixon French, I spent,
sent it on the areas around Henry County
and Griffin in Spalding County,
Northwest Fayette County,
Center Newton County and Weston Douglas County would still apply. That would mean that tens of
thousands of black voters in those areas were still not equal opportunity to still not have equal
opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. As we did in 2021, Senate Democrats again
pleaded with Republicans to pass a map that complies with the voting rights act and does
not discriminate against bike voters. We believe that passing the Republican map would only
lead to more litigation and waste taxpayer dollars. Georgians deserve fair maps and it is our duty
to create fair maps that reflect the diversity of Georgia and comply with federal law.
Madam Chair, that concludes my presentation and if you will give us the opportunity to
ask and ask the questions, we will comply with that.
Thank you.
Yeah, so we'll open up now if anyone has any questions for the majority later about the
map she's presented.
The whip and the chair are here to help supply answers to question as well.
Sure.
Although the whip is the member of this committee.
Madam, later I was trying to follow along as you were reading that testimony, but I didn't
sure I have it accurate. What are the two additional black majority districts in South Atlanta
that were required by the judges order? What are the two districts? 16 and 17. 16 and 17.
That's correct. If you don't mind me, if you'll look at the blown up, we were supposed to
have a map that you have at Senator Couser in your packet. You'll have to flip to the non-state
wide plan to the Metro Atlanta plan to be able to see it at all.
So your new districts are numbered 16 and 17 in this packet that we've been presented.
How did you in creating this map take into account the different experts that it testified
in that court proceeding. My understanding is the Democratic Party and the plaintiffs
in that case had a fellow named Bill Cooper and one named Bill Esselstein or something
like that. They had two competing kind of proposals. How did you account for their different
approaches that the plaintiffs' own experts had in that case challenging the original
out. So we are not parties to that litigation and I'm not sure that any any of us know and have gone
to that minute detail about exactly what maps the plaintiffs submitted. We are offering this
proposal. Well it's important because that's what the judge based his decision on and the chairman's
plan very closely followed the plaintiffs expert Blake Esselstein's proposal. Actually
Senator R is much more closely mirrors the plans submitted by the plaintiffs because
I thought you weren't familiar with that a second ago.
Well I'm vaguely familiar I'm not familiar with the exact differences between Cooper and
Eswellstein but I am familiar with the fact that the plaintiffs maps create two new majority
minority districts in the area directly mandated by the court which is the affected area of
of the 10 districts and this proposal does the same
and it makes no changes outside of the court's affected area.
Yesterday's map makes dramatic changes outside of it
and barely any changes providing black voters
any new opportunities in the affected area.
So in that sense, our map is far more similar
to the various plaintiffs' maps.
Should I question you or the sponsor of this bill?
I'm serving as her attorney for this particular hearing.
All right, well then, I will.
And I'm the second signer.
I'm the second signer.
May I continue?
I will follow up and whichever one of you
has the wants to give me the legal answer or the political answer,
I'll take either one.
Did you use political data when drawing this map?
No, I mean, there's always a byproduct
in looking at maps with data, but no.
I mean, the maps are drawn to represent the courts mandate
within the affected area.
And the mandate is two new majority minority districts
within the affected area.
So it's just pure happenstance that the Democratic map
happens to create two new democratic districts,
giving a partisan advantage, whereas the chairman's map
left it exactly the same as the current political split
in the state center.
And look at that at all, just by the look of the draw, you ended up making a partisan advantage map.
Have you, Senator, run the partisan data on this map?
I haven't, but it's something contained in the deal.
It is? I don't think so.
I'm looking at it.
I'm not aware that that was.
And I hand out that was, isn't all the committee members, folders?
That's not a, that's not a provided by us.
And it says we're judging this on two things.
Number one, do we add majority black districts
both plans do comply with the judge's order?
Number two, it judges on, does it affect partisan balance?
The Democratic plan does affect the partisan balance
by adding two Democratic seats.
And the chairman's plan did not.
I know you may not have prepared this,
but this allegedly independent group
that claims to be nonpartisan shows
that your map gives a partisan advantage
as well as the two new black seats.
Well, what I think is interesting is that,
you know, I'm looking at this,
and as the leader said, we did not provide it.
But what I'm noticing is that the group that provided it
is giving very high marks to this proposal
under both VRA grounds and under traditional
redistricting principles grounds.
That's what I'm noticing in their handout.
Yeah, well, I wasn't a math major,
But the one that says the Senate plan here that the chairman
is presented, gives 33 Republican districts in the new plan,
and there was 33 in the old plan.
And it gives 23 Democratic districts in the new plan,
and 23 in the old, whereas the Democratic proposal
creates 31 Republican districts and 25 Democratic districts.
But somehow, the math is not taken into account
deciding whether it affects partisan changes. So which of the districts changed to draw the
new majority black just 16 and 17? No, each of the 10 districts found to be illegal by the court,
each of them changed and the leader pretty exhaustively walked through it, happy to provide all
of you with that printout because obviously it's very lengthy and so maybe you know it's hard to
follow along the whole thing when you're just when you're speaking so certainly
happy to give you the specifics of exactly what was changed but every one of
the ten districts which are the affected area as decreed by the district
court has been changed to bring them into compliance with the voting rights
actually we don't have a list of those we do we do we do well certainly I mean we
all know what they are there let's ask and I'm not as savvy in reading this
a bill that's you know 85 pages thick to know which of the 10 districts we're
talking about. All right so if you're looking at your your map center
cows are your blow up of the affected area right which is the South
Metro Atlanta area. Okay. Specifically the court identified Senate
districts 10, 16, 17, 25, 28, 30, 34, 35, 43, and 44, as the area in which are currently
enacted districts violate the Voting Rights Act.
And are those the 10 districts that changed under the Democratic plan?
Yes, sir.
Good.
And no other districts changed.
So, under the proposal yesterday, 80% of the new black voters come from areas outside the
affected area, which is irrelevant to the court's analysis, whereas in ours, 100% come
from the affected area and zero other Georgians are impacted.
And importantly, here's where you can really get into the nitty gritty.
There are two things that are really important.
Number one, under federal court precedent, under the precedent called gingles, whether
or not it's pretty, there's a clear and not constitutional analysis on whether or not
you need to create a majority minority district.
And there are factors that are followed.
where that, where one can be created,
it needs to be created.
And that's why he limited it to the affected area,
because you don't just create them anywhere.
You're required to create them in certain areas
where the population is sizeable enough,
there's racially polarized voting,
and a few other things like that.
Are you disappointed then that your district now
is a majority black district?
Certainly not.
Good.
I mean, I, I do, I'll say this.
I'm not bothered.
what in one of the 10 that the judge identified?
It was not one of the, right.
So essentially you cannot, where a majority minority district
has to be created, you can't satisfy it
by moving around people in other areas
where no voter discrimination was found.
You have not cured where the court said voter discrimination
is found and the process is not equally open
to black voters.
That was simply not found in the area
of the map outside the 10 districts.
So in our map, yeah, in our map, for example,
100,000 new black voters will be in the position
to equally and fully participate in the political process,
which is exactly what the court found is not happening,
under our enacted districts, 100,000.
Basically, the only way the proposal from yesterday
tries to create anything is by just shuffling people around.
So people that are in this-
That is in other words, redistricting.
Yeah, but you didn't let me finish.
So when you just simply move people around,
all you're doing is trying to obfuscate the fact
that very, very, very few new voters
have been provided with any new opportunity.
There's 3,000, 3,000.
And you know how big our districts are.
So it simply just doesn't comply.
Thank you.
Madam Leader, earlier you referred to a pact and crack in your testimony, what is your
definition of pact?
When you take photos of the same race and put them all in one place.
packing. I'm sure you know that Senator. Okay. And do you agree at least that the
chair's proposal does create two new majority black districts in the area
that the judge identified? No. No. No. It does not. Okay.
I'm part of this analysis that took place where the court actually did mention various districts
that were in violation of the VRA and two of those I think were 16 and 34 but I don't
think they had any changes to them at all and yet the court has said because he actually
listed various districts that had those issues,
those legal issues.
So Madam Leute, can you tell us possibly why you,
in the previous map that we had,
we see two particular districts that had no changes at all,
even though they're specifically mentioned
within the courts order as far as seven issues
with the voting rights act.
I'm sorry.
What was that a question to make?
No, it's a map leader.
Okay.
Yeah.
On district 16 and 34, the fact that they had no changes at all, even though they were
mentioned specifically within the VRA or within the judge's order of having issues with
the VRA.
Any reason why you think that may have actually taken place.
in the previous map that we saw yesterday.
To Mr. Rita, it does, however,
create a legal problem.
You're highlighting another legal problem
in yesterday's map.
Anyone out?
What number are you for?
for, yes, I'm not recognized.
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Sorry.
For whoever wants to answer this, this co-sponsored the bill.
We did receive this chart, and I just want to follow up with Chairman Hatchett's question.
We heard numerous public comment yesterday that this does comply with the mandate and
I'm sorry that the Chairman Eccles map complies with the mandate.
This identifies that it complies with the mandate.
Your position just to clarify is that this does not comply with the mandate.
Also, we heard from the plaintiff's attorney yesterday.
It was not on.
Sorry.
Yeah, apologies.
Do I need to repeat that?
Are we good?
Yeah, so the answer was yes.
So no, yeah.
The remedy section of the complaint states specifically there should be two majority
black districts created.
It does, in the affected area.
And do you believe that Chairman Eccles mapped at that?
So this particular thing you're referencing,
I think it was stated very clearly that they were simply
doing a numerical analysis and not a legal analysis
in terms of compliance as in are there
two new majority black districts.
However, that is not at all the inquiry that
is required to be conducted a simple mathematical equation
when you're talking about the Voting Rights Act.
And that is why Judge Jones said create
two majority black districts in the affected area.
The affected area are the 10 districts
that we previously stated.
And as it stands, yesterday's proposal
provides a varied poultry, 3,000 black voters,
new black voters, the opportunity
to participate equally in the political process.
It's actually nine districts that are mentioned
in the order in its district slash areas.
And then he does recognize district 10, 16, 17, 25, 28,
30, 34, 35, and 44 as the district slash areas.
I think the key in that section of the order,
which if you have it, I can tell you what page it's on.
It's down in my office.
It's on page 513.
I can get it from my office, but if you want me to look
at you in a minute.
The key there is that it mentions district-slash areas.
I think you're limiting that to districts and not recognizing that the order actually
states that the new black districts should come from these nine district-slash areas.
I think that's potentially a point of contention between the two of you.
Can I respond to that?
Sure, absolutely.
So the areas would be South Metro, which are Henry, Spalding, Northwest Fayette, Central
and Western Douglas.
Yeah, the areas that were,
I don't know how much of those
are captured in the districts that I just read,
but those districts listed.
All of them.
Correct.
So they're kind of one in the same thing, would you agree?
Right.
So in the Chairman's map,
the two new Black Majority Districts
are derived from seven of the nine identified areas.
So I think that perhaps her contention,
I'm going to ask her this later,
would be that the seven of the nine
does capture the spirit of what was stated.
I do want to focus.
Can I respond to that?
You please, yeah.
So the problem is that when the disenfranchised voters
are down in Henry County, for example,
you can't take voters who aren't disenfranchised
into cabin Fulton counties and use them to try to say,
now they're, because they weren't disenfranchised,
you still have to enfranchise and allow
the voters in the vote delusion area to participate fully.
And those are the ones down south.
You can't like take these districts north
outside of the area where the court found the illegal maps and say oh yeah
everything's great I mean that's just not it doesn't satisfy the VRA or the
court's order as it relates to district 16 is that one of your new a majority
black districts in your map yes if you look at that's correct yeah can we can we
talk about that for a second what and you're my where the communities of
interest that connect, I guess, South Fulton, Cawita, and Fayette.
I'm sorry, South Fulton, Fayette, and Newton.
So before I go back and reread what leader Butler already
read about those districts, which I can certainly do.
That'd be great.
OK, I'm going to reread that.
I don't need to reread it.
Maybe you could just highlight in your own words
what those communities of interest are.
All right.
District 16.
This district becomes a new majority-black district
to comply with Section 2 of the VRA and the Judges Order.
It retains its Northwest Fayette Corps
and add sections of Northeast Fayette County
that were previously packed into District 34.
The district also includes portions of South Fulton County
from the Pack District 35 and Northeast Calvita County
from the Crack District 28 along the I-85 corridor,
including all or parts of the cities
of Union City, Fairburn, and Nunean.
compared to the old district 16,
it removed non-section two areas
of Fayette, Spalding Pike, and Lamar Counties.
17.
That's helpful for, let's just stay on 16 if that's okay.
Sure.
Yeah, I will note for 17, it is worth repeating this
because it really is critical to the court's analysis
and it's the area where there's the largest,
so again, piggybacking on what I was saying earlier,
you're required to create a majority minority district
when certain factors are meant.
The single largest, there's large growth
in the minority population in Henry County, right?
If you look at a map and you turn on
for ethnic and racial background, you will see.
There's like a glaring huge block of individuals
right there.
And so it is worth repeating that it says,
The prior district, right before we enacted,
right, these ones, had become a 42%
black opportunity district and was overpopulated.
It was possible to create a new majority black district
just from within the core of that district.
And that is because between 2011 and 2021,
Henry County's white population decreased by 19%
and the black population increased by 60%.
And that's where, you know, we were saying during,
when we enacted these maps in the Florida Bay,
we said, look, y'all,
George's population grew by almost a million,
not quite the vast majority of that growth,
in fact, all of that growth was among voters of color.
And black, the black population increased by five
to 600,000 people.
And a lot of them are in this area.
And they need to be able to have a voice in the process.
Okay.
Just coming back to 16, I think that you referenced earlier
when Senator Kauser asked a couple questions that no,
you guys didn't use any political data and that you were even
unaware of what the partisan shifts may be with this new map.
You just referenced the turning out of maps and looking at
racial data.
Did you solely use racial data in drawing the 16th?
Yes.
Okay, so there's no other data used to draw the 16th?
Well, no, you mean you have to use,
You got to look at like the block files
and you got to look at all of the things
that go into making a map.
So other than establishing the balance districts
within the threshold,
I think your increase was the sole fact.
You got to talk about what we've done
is follow the court's order and the Voting Rights Act,
which is to create two new majority minority districts
within the identified vote delusion area.
that's all we did. That's what we did. And to this extent that demography is
destiny, I would push back on that a little bit. I don't know what the partisan
data is. I don't have it in front of me. Okay, I just want to clarify, because I think I heard you say yes to the answer that it was solely racial,
it was solely race that you relied on to draw the 16th. No, no, look, you have to use all kinds of different factors and race can be one of them.
And it is because we were ordered to draw to new majority minority districts as it relates to 16
them. What were the other factors that were used? Let's go back to it again.
So it became it became one of our new majority black districts to comply with section two and the judge's order.
But it followed other
traditional redistricting principles and this map follows other traditional
redistricting principles much better than yesterday's map in the sense of
communities of interest, core of
prior districts and the like. So this
district retains its Northwest Fayette Core
and add sections of Northeast Fayette County
that were previously packed into District 34. I recognize the geographical lines of the
district. That's not my question. Okay. My question is specifically what other
data was used to draw this district other than race. When I first asked you, did
you solely use race? You said yes. Now you're saying that other factors were
used and I'm wondering what those are. What other data do you always use? Do I
mean you've got to look at the precinct lines. You've got to look at
population. You've got to look at. I got that. Yeah. You got to look at, I'm
You're interrupting my turn to that.
I mean, you've got to look at the population.
You've got to look at geographic, important geographic
boundaries such as county lines, city lines, et cetera.
OK.
My last question on 16.
I see how we to now is split.
It was not split previously.
On the map was this split done primarily
to add black voters to the 16th.
So you follow the communities of interest,
the core of the prior districts, compactness.
All of that has been followed.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, what are we probably going to do now?
That's one thing.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
To follow up on something you said earlier
about complying with the judge's order and I believe,
he also said the judge said these are,
these districts are legally drawn
your position was you needed to change each one of those districts based on the
touches orders. That right? The judge found that yeah that in the 10 voter area
I mean 10 district area that all those that those 10 districts were drawn
illegally and that y'all needed to in response to the judges orders you
understand is that you need to redraw each one of those. That there should be a
a two new majority minority districts
within the 10 district area.
But I guess the question that I'm asking is,
you were saying those are illegal districts,
those are individual legal districts,
and that y'all needed to redraw each one of those districts
based on the judges' order.
Well, once you follow all the, you know,
redistricting principles,
and create the two new majority minority districts,
you are, first of all, you, yes,
You don't want to leave illegal districts, ones that have been packed and cracked.
So once you account for all of that, you've changed each one of those 10.
What's your definition of packed and cracked?
Packed is when you try to put a very significant numbers of certain communities in a small number
of districts.
your interpretation of the judge's orders was that all of those districts you
listed were illegally drawn and each one of those districts individually needed
to be redrawn. Well I believe I just answered that one. Well I haven't I haven't
gotten you to answer that specifically but the question is is it your position
and the position in considering how you read how this map was drawn that the
judge said each one of these districts needs to be redrawn. He drew he said
these 10 districts are a problem and that's the affected area but I can't read
his mind exactly right so I don't know and I don't have the opinion in front
of me I forgot to bring it from office so I probably need a reference it but my
memory would be that he said these 10 districts are illegal that's the
affected area to new majority minority districts need to be drawn in the
effected area. In the effected area. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
Senator, I'm Anna Vitarte. Thank you, Chairwoman. I had just quick couple questions.
And I direct us at the minority leader or someone in the Democratic Caucus. Can someone articulate
based on data or I guess methodology why Rockdale County was split in half.
Rockdale. So we're talking about 43 and 10.
The 10. This existing majority black district maintains its DeCab and Henry
County Corps which again is one of the you know traditional redistricting
principles and adds a portion of Rockdale County that is becoming increasingly
diverse and had it previously been been cracked into the 17th district. So I
know two of my colleagues to my left basically border Rockdale County in
terms of the county you know the makeup just you know demographics everything
in the Rockdale County, I mean, doesn't make sense
to split Rockdale County in half.
Well, where you need to draw the majority minority districts,
it depends on where the population is sizable enough
and can be shares commonalities with other communities
and can be outvoted for lack of a better term right now
by the majority, right?
So when you, if you start to look at the demographics,
you see where those communities are,
and that's where you're required
to create majority minority districts.
So based on that, and kind of going back,
I guess, to the methodology that you cited earlier about,
taken from the North and trying to satisfy the South,
what in terms of community interests, similarities
exist between South to Cab, and I'm saying this
as somebody who used to be a resident of DeCab County,
to someone who literally lives
on the Henry County Butts County line.
Right, so I think we stated, the leader stated in her presentation that there's a significant
black population there and that part of us.
So I understand that, but what else in the community in South of Cab and Southeast Henry
would be similar?
So was it based, it was drawn strictly based on race?
No, as I already went over, no district is drawn strictly based on race.
which you just said. No idea. Based on South of Cab and it is a factor and as you are certainly aware
it's an important factor and in fact it's the factor that has forced us into a special redistricting
session so it's certainly relevant. Could you articulate what are the other factors in South of
Cab and Southeast Henry County that we're used to draw that part of district 10? Well we're
required to create a new majority minority district in that area where the
Gingles factors have been proven in court. So you don't have specific data
you could share with the committee at this point? I can re-read you the other
reasons why. I've already heard everything you read, probably from your attorneys.
So, all right, thank you.
Do you want to visit him?
No.
I'll say no.
Okay.
What are you nine?
11.
He had asked first, and then after him,
no good.
That's fine.
No, no.
No, no.
Call on.
Okay.
We'll hear.
I, President.
You're welcome.
Thank you very much.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
One of the things that occurred to me, and I just want
I put this out for consideration, is that I believe yesterday the Alpha-Fi Alpha fraternity
group, a primary player in the lawsuit in the first place, a Senator of the Committee
stating that it is their belief that this has drawn by the Republican maps, it violates
the Voting Rights Act. This is a plaintiff comment as stated by the to the committee and I believe
that's that's going to carry some weight. And in that light as it relates to violating
the Voting Rights Act and causing confusion, don't you think that this is going to be more
money, more confusion and it's going to cause people to hesitate about going to the polls
that's going to cause a lot of things
that perhaps shouldn't occur when we're looking forward
to the 2024 election.
I'm just putting it out there for your consideration
and to the chair and to comment for my leader and chairs.
Well, I just believe that that's the big elephant
in the room, they're saying that this violates the voting
right there, clearly, and it does not comply with the judge's order punctuation period.
If that's not the case, maybe I'm reading this wrong, but I believe that is a great
food for thought. Thank you. Thank you. Senator Kennedy.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Leader, my question is in drawing the maps that you all
came to ultimately be what is presented to us today.
That's a very dynamic process.
I'd know about that from two years ago,
and you know about it from many years of working with maps.
I know that not many years have worked with maps.
OK, all right.
Sorry if I was giving you more credit in that area
than I should have.
I just know you've been here a long time.
It served for a very long time.
Not an expert at growing maps.
OK.
I do recall last time, two years ago, you were very active in expressing your opinions
and the opinions of your party about the maps that we offered, and I think we can agree
on that.
That's my vote.
Yes, ma'am.
My question is, in all the work that went into formulating ultimately what we see as
the bill that you've provided and that you're presenting today, did you make any efforts
to draw a map that you thought complied with the court's order, but maintain the same
partisan numbers that we have now of 33-23.
We don't have partisan data, Mr. Pertem.
Okay, so now you're telling Madam Lee, do you have anything to say?
I'm happy to be here for you, but I don't know why you said that Senator, that doesn't
address my question.
My question is, were efforts made to draw a map that you thought complied with the courts
order, but maintaining the same Republican Democratic numbers that we have currently?
Not if you've got to produce two new majority black districts, we can't maintain the same
numbers.
Well, you can.
Whoever runs can win.
It's too much to add to what numbers we have.
of majority minority.
So your position is and was in the process
that in complying with the court's order,
you were required to come up with a map
that added two Democrats.
Is that what you're telling us?
No, sir.
No, two of you are at a black district.
Okay.
So I guess back to Senator Counselor's question earlier
that really wasn't answered,
it just happened to be that the map shell came up with.
changed the partisan numbers correct no it's a work of art it's not happens
stands as he said let me ask it this way senator parent you're saying no as
if you're seemingly unaware of the rd numbers of the maps is being of the
map being presented can can either of you tell me or tell this committee what
you understand the republican democratic split to be under this map is
proposed. I actually I don't have it in front of me. I don't think we have it in
front of us. I mean are if you're saying that a Republican cannot win a
majority minority district. No that's no that's no that's not what I'm saying
it's very simple and very straightforward. Oh you mean what are the actual
voter analyses in terms of like which election are you talking about? Are
you talking about governor last time or are you talking about okay what are
you talking about? We don't have to get into that level it's a very simple and
straightforward question of what is your opinion,
Madam Leader or Senator Parent,
of what is the Republican Democratic split of the map
that you're presenting?
What is the anticipated district count
for Republicans versus Democrats?
So what we're dealing with is a court order
that said create two majority minority districts
in the affected area.
And that's what we did and that's all we did.
And the court didn't look at partisanship,
That isn't part of this as you're well aware the Supreme Court said partisan
gerrymandering was fine and racial gerrymandering isn't. I understand. That's what
this order is based on and that's this map that you have. Senator, thank you for
that. Can you answer my question though? Because you have, you completely, wait a minute,
hold on a minute. You've completely dodged my question. Which is, do you have an
opinion of whether or not or what the numbers are in the map that you're
presenting? As I've stated several times, we do not have that. I don't have that
in front of me, and I'm asking, I guess what I'm asking you is what's the relevance to
the court's order?
Well, because Senator Perry, you'll certainly remember that two years ago, when we did
our redistricting process, you, other members of your party, were very critical of the maps
that we presented and said that they were partisan.
They were two partisan.
They were partisan gerrymandered.
They were gerrymandered in a way to maintain certain majorities.
So that was clearly a part of the narrative.
And so the question now is Senator Chausser, Chairman Chausser, pointed out, it just seems
to be that the map, y'all have presented, gives you, gives your party, a two-seat advantage
over the current maps.
Well, the independent group that has provided the flyers that are in here does.
I think an independent analysis of the RD political number, which suggests those numbers
are right, perhaps.
I haven't studied them either, I'm relying on what's in the file.
And so the very thing that y'all have criticized us through the process of making it and using
partisan objectives seems to be exactly where we've landed with the maps.
It seems to be exactly where we've landed with the maps that you have presented, but you
don't want to talk about partisanship.
But clearly it just happens to be that's where you luckily landed, but it is striking that
We come to this committee and we have very knowledgeable
and experienced and seasoned senators that want to suggest
you don't even know what the RD numbers are
of the map that's presented.
So if there was criticism,
that there was a partisan gerrymander,
which there was and there was from Fair Districts
and a whole bunch of groups.
And they think that this map in front of us
is fairer to the voters of Georgia
because it undoes a partial and racial gerrymandering.
That means that we're not gerrymandering.
Well, you've just conflated two issues.
You've jumped from political gerrymandering
to talking about racial gerrymandering.
And my question is just about the political I think.
So if we've undone a partisan gerrymandering,
then we've not gerrymandered.
And let me just read to you, Mr. Protem,
the Princeton gerrymandering project
is out with their analysis of yesterday's map.
and they said, it is a blooming carnation of gerrymandering
with oblong pedal-shaped districts radiating out
from Atlanta.
So if ours isn't drawn like that,
it's because it's not a gerrymander.
Okay.
I mean, would you not acknowledge
that Georgia is a purple state?
And you think we should maintain a 2333?
Is that your position?
My question to you is whether or not you will acknowledge
that you have drawn this map in a way
that provides a political advantage.
And if you can't acknowledge that,
if you don't recognize the numbers
that seemingly the independent folks acknowledge,
it's kind of hard to have a conversation and go forward.
Okay, well we can have that conversation.
It may.
And it's because it undoes the partisan gerrymander
partially that y'all have put in place starting in 2010.
Which is what you just said a few moments ago
that the court recognized in fact can happen, right?
That was your legal opinion that you were providing us.
The Supreme Court, which is why we're here on the Voting Rights Act, is different, a
different inquiry than partisan gerrymandering.
So is the objective of the map that you provided one for partisan purposes or one for purely
racial purposes?
We are here under the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, and that's the only thing that concerns
us today.
The only thing in front of Judge Jones, and Judge Jones said, these 10 districts are
legal. Section of enacted maps
violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as to the following area slash
districts enacted Senate districts 10 16 17 25 28 30 34 35 43 and 44 and he
said draw to majority minority districts within the affected area. And
that's what this map does in keeping with aside from that traditional
redistricting principles, and certainly traditional redistricting principles as to the non-affected
areas of the map instead of ripping things apart and destroying communities of interest,
and it makes no changes to 46 districts, which doesn't change the middle.
Okay, thank you.
Any other questions?
Okay, thank you. At this, at this time, we'll move to the public comments from the people
who signed up just a few moments ago. So first up is Cindy Battles and then on deck is
Ms. Shale Sanchez. Yes, so so yesterday we had a five minute time limit per speaker.
So we'll acknowledge that same time limit today.
Thank you, I am pretty sure I can do that in five minutes.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak, obviously with the House and the Senate
meeting at the same time yesterday, even as talented as I am, being in two places at one
time is a little bit difficult.
I do want to kind of talk a little bit about that process, about the fact that there's been
such limited time for public comment.
talked about when the maps were released. I don't know what kind of attempts have been
made to reach out to the public, but I would like to say that pursuant to Judge Jones's
order, it feels like getting that public comment and making those efforts is important.
As we've mentioned before on October 26th, the legislature was instructed to redraw its
maps and to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Judge Jones will ultimately
decide whether the legislature has complied with this order.
But providing so little time for public comments and not reaching out to the community's most
directly impacted by Judge Jones's orders continues the previous practices that contributed
to the illegality I can spell and speak, I promise, of the previous maps.
These proposed maps continue to deny voters of color and equal opportunity to participate
and the political process specifically
because of the dismantling of districts
that elect the candidates of choice of voters of colors,
such as what is proposed for Senate District 6,
which is Senator Estevez's district,
and what was previously Senate District 42,
Senator Parent's District.
The proposed map also does not appear to comply
with Judge Jones's order,
because Judge Jones has held that black voters
residing in 10 Senate districts in the Southern Atlanta
Metro did not have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of choice in violation of
section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Thus, he ordered that the legislature draw two additional
majority blacks in its districts from that cluster of 10 districts. However, most of the
black voters in the purportedly new majority black districts appear to have been moved
from outside those 10 districts. And many of those voters already resided in majority
Black districts. Other districts that were racially
gerrymandered under the originally enacted plan, included Senate
districts 1, 2, 4, 17, and 56, remain racially gerrymandered in the proposed plan.
In Chatham County, which is split three ways, SD2 remains packed, diluting the voters,
the votes of voters of colors in SD1 and 4. The original SD17 is now essentially the new SD
42 and remains unlawfully cracked. This district is among the districts that
Judge Jones stated was in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and
remains virtually unchanged. Additionally Senate District 56 remains unlawfully
cracked. Just because some of the things that we've heard here today I want to
point out that the court order does not state that the legislature should only
comply with the order and that in the Voting Rights Act if it maintains a part
as an advantage. Partisan advantage does not supersede the Voting Rights Act or federal
law. You cannot discriminate against black voters to retain partisan advantage. Even
if the Supreme Court allows you to do so, sir, it is not okay. It is not okay. And we've
had this conversation when we talked about the Democrats trying to do the same thing
to retain power when Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act still gave Republicans the right
to go before the Department of Justice and say,
hey, this is a partisan gerrymandering.
It's not OK.
I implore you to please, as you move forward,
consider the voters, consider what the voters want,
and draw maps that reflect that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next, we have Michelle Sanchez, and on deck
is Yolanda Pickstock.
Hello.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak.
My name is Michelle Sanchez and I've been a community organizer
in Georgia for eight years focusing on Latine
and black communities.
Today I speak on behalf of Casa and Casa in Action,
representing our members in DeCab,
Fulton, Clayton and Henry counties.
We find it very concerning that despite Judge Jones's ruling
that the current map violates the Voting Rights Act
by diluting black voting power,
the new maps fall short of creating new majority black districts.
The judge identified 10 districts with vote delusion.
While this map technically adds two majority black districts
as ordered, it removes two districts with over 40% minorities
and diminishes black voter power in other districts.
This map fails to honor the spirit of the court order.
Instead of providing two additional districts
where black voters can elect their candidates,
it protects every incumbent and denies
black voters any additional representation.
It's very unfortunate that the already struggling Georgia voters
are having to spend their hard earned tax dollars
on this special session that would not have been necessary
had Georgia Republicans done the right thing the first time
the maps were drawn.
You have a chance now to do the right thing.
And in no better time considering
so many people are questioning the power of their votes.
By failing to follow the judge's order
of enfranchising a block of black voter, black Georgians,
and instead opting for an numerical loophole,
this body impairs itself to failing to comply with the ruling
and fails the people of Georgia.
Do the right thing here, people.
It's not that hard.
Thank you.
Next, we have Yolanda Pickstock,
and then after Yolanda will be our final speaker,
Janet Grant.
Good morning.
Yolanda Pickstock, legislative director for Georgia's standup.
We commend those who have presented the maps
discussed today.
This map does comply with the judges' order
by adding two additional black majority districts,
Senate districts, 16 and 17.
and it does not increase competitive districts.
Georgia stand up, which is part of the redistricting alliance,
believes elections should be determined by voters
and not politicians who draw maps.
We support independent redistricting commissions,
which are more transparent and impartial.
Independent redistricting commissions,
established standards for those who can serve on commissions
and criteria, which must be followed
when drawing district maps.
As communities in Georgia,
we would like the state to move towards
more inclusive redistricting processes
by creating independent district in commissions.
Specifically, FAAIT and Spalding areas were ignored
by the maps presented yesterday.
As coalition groups, we have worked to set the administrative
record via local redistricting resolutions,
which the county of Clayton has passed.
we thank you for the opportunity to speak.
Thank you.
And our final speaker is Janet Grant.
Good morning, chair Eccles and members of the committee.
My name is Janet Grant and I'm co-chair of Fair Districts
Georgia.
I appreciate the opportunity to testify today.
I was over in the house testifying
when while you were meeting yesterday
and pleased to be able to speak on the Democratic Caucus
map.
As a reminder, Fair Districts Georgia
is a nonpartisan grassroots citizen organization
solely focused on abdicating for fair redistricting
and redistricting reform.
We believe that the maps enacted during this session
should comply with the court's order
while excluding any unrelated unnecessary changes
for partisan gain in keeping with our long held priority
of opposing mid-cycle redistricting by both parties.
You do have in front of you, I've heard several of you have been looking at it.
You have in front of you our scorecard for the Democratic House map and you also have
the scorecard that can reference yesterday for Chair Eccles map.
On the Democratic House Caucus map are simple two-part pass-fail tests.
In this case, we find that the map does meet the first criteria of the court order with
two new black majority districts.
also meets the second test in that it clearly passes with no unnecessary changes purely
to gain partisan advantage. You've now discussed two Senate maps. The difference that we're
concerned about is the unnecessary disruption of voters in Chair Eccles map, which impacts
15 districts moving 14.4% of the statewide population. While the Democratic caucus map
demonstrates that the court order can be met without broad disruption and potentially
vote delusion of the chair's map. The Democratic caucus map is more surgically
precise impacting just 10 districts and 8.4% of the population. This puts the
chair's map should it pass at risk as we've heard from others for being struck
down by judge Jones in which case a special master would draw a map for the
court which may or may not result in less attention to incumbent protection. We
strongly encourage you to revisit the map and take control and pass a map that
fully reflects the growing diversity of Georgia and does not have the risk of
being overturned by the court. Thanks for the opportunity to present today.
Thank you. So that concludes the public hearing portion of the meeting.
Madam leader at this point if I think the times appropriate to entertain a motion if you would like to have motion on your map
Thank you, madam chair. I
Move that
Senate be a one EX
Excuse me
Wait, no, we haven't.
Where did I get that?
So we got a motion in a second for EX.
Or that was a joke.
Move.
I'm not going to make you a motion.
Oh, so about this.
OK, I apologize.
Let's make my motion.
No, I'm not going to make you a motion.
I'm looking at the wrong bell for EX.
For EX?
Yeah.
So we have a motion.
Second, Madam Chair, but we also speak to the motion.
Okay.
Discussion?
Yes.
I do second that motion.
I did want to have a brief discussion on Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Obviously, we supported this particular 4EX.
But I do want to just talk about,
because I could say this now or when you take up 1EX later,
that we have taken up basically in three hours this committee.
This committee. Eight days worth of testimony in the court. They had 20 witnesses live.
They had 20 witnesses through deposition. The court made a 516 page findings.
And we have basically taken that within this committee and condensed it down to three hours worth of testimony, if you want to call it that, to make a decision on these maps, which is a gigantic decision, quite frankly.
Because, of course, it does involve the Voting Rights Act.
And I've heard comments about we're here because left-wing groups have brought us to this point.
It's not true.
What has brought us to this point is, unfortunately, the sad sword history of voting in Georgia.
And its decision from Georgia to continually suppress and oppress the rights of one particular group African Americans.
And that sad sort of history cannot be refuted because even the defense's own experts stipulate
it to that particular history.
So we know it exists, and that's what actually brings us here.
Today, and of course, now the perfunctory remark will be what part of that sad history
came through because Democrats were in control.
Of course, that remark misses the point that life is not static.
can change, parties change. In fact, those who know history realize that parties were initially
frowned upon in the United States. Many thought that one of the reasons that George Washington
run for his third term was because of proliferation of political parties. So parties change. But
you know what, that analysis about what party was in control, what party was not in control,
misses the point that the court points out, misses the point that the reason why we had
the vote and rights act, the point is about not who's been in control, the point is about
who's been discriminated against.
And so no matter who was after, no matter who was Democrats or Republicans or any other
group, the constant group that was discriminated against stopped whether through written law
or through informal law, or remember defensive experts are stipulated to all of this that
I'm saying is African-Americans.
That's why we're here.
It's not about whether to get too extra seats on a Democratic side or a Republican side.
In fact, the court even addressed that because if you remember, the offenses expert tried
to make the point and said, we have racial polarized voting in Georgia because African-Americans
may vote more Democratic.
Of course, that's not the issue.
The issue is who has been discriminated against?
Why do you have racialized polarized voting?
And can that particular group of hundreds of years of discrimination elect the persons
of their choice?
And according to that order, following a conservative Supreme Court, mind you, said no,
that these lines that were drawn violated the Voting Rights Act, following and using the
rationale used by a conservative Supreme Court.
And understand that many of the metrics used in that case in Alabama, whether it was racial
post-vised voting or some of the factors that the conservative Supreme Court looked at,
Georgia actually fell as we fall below that.
Our racial polarized voting is actually more extensive
than in Alabama.
Many of the factors that they looked at in the Alabama case,
Georgia falls below that.
When we start talking about some of the factors to look at,
whether it's pole closing, what there's
different types of laws that have been enacted,
this court found that Georgia actually
falls below Alabama.
We're heading in the wrong direction.
And we realize that these potential map that might be going forward is not going to pass
Constitution of mustard and we're going to have someone who knows nothing about a lot
of us drawing these particular maps.
It was asked about what metrics were used in determining about 4EX and I would say that
I find that a very interesting comment because two redistricted cycles now still don't
know the metrics that have been used by the majority party that were most likely.
Be going forward.
Don't know the socioeconomic factors that have been used.
Don't know the racial polarization that have been used.
These are things that were brought up before.
Now all that was came out in testimony in the court case.
But what metrics were used?
But no one says what metrics were used on the opposite side.
What are the socioeconomic factors?
Why is it that African Americans are below on so many numbers that the court took
into consideration.
What metrics were used as far as racially polarized voting?
What metrics were used when you find that,
as far as if you have a, in a general election,
African-American and white candidate,
that African-American normalment can't get over 10%
of that white vote?
What metrics were used?
It isn't about one or two extra seats here.
And there was a question about acknowledgement.
A knowledge about two extra seats.
until we get ready to acknowledge the history
and present history of voting in this state
and the design to stop.
One group, doesn't matter about who,
I don't care about the party, but one group,
African Americans from ex-Sus and the right to vote,
we will continue to go through these
ridiculouses process over and over and over.
That's the acknowledgement we need to be making.
is who has been discriminated against.
Let's acknowledge that and then find out how to go forward
to make sure that group has the opportunity
to let the candidates of their choice.
But I do support SB4EX and I do second that motion.
Thank you.
What number are you?
Two.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Madame Chair, just to comment.
I represent District 33.
Basically, all y'all know me in here.
I'm not a black and white guy.
But I have to look at the data when it comes to District 33.
The black vote in age before we started this process
was over 40%.
Now it's down to 32%.
When you get below 37%, a group of voters are not
effective at election that candid it
or get in their politics formulated in positive manner.
want to go and that's quite a drop from 40% to 32%.
That's a significant drop.
And you have to wonder since that district 33 is
minority opportunity district wise that happened in how
can I explain that to the people in my district.
What does it mean?
I might not get reelected.
That's one of the things it means.
It means in the morning, when it comes to roll call,
I won't be able to call out the Senator
from the 31st name or call out to y'all.
Senator from the 46 may not be around.
I won't be around so he can laugh at my corny jokes.
Senator from the 51st, we've worked hard
traveling around the state, trying to formulate
developmental authorities and take on some tough issues.
But basically, what does it mean that the people in my district
probably be disenfranchised. But I just want to make that comment and I support the Democratic bill.
Thank you. Thank you. Any more discussion about SB 4EX?
That's your bill. Okay, so we have had a motion, we have had a second, we've had discussion,
So I think it is time to vote.
Let me read off LC 472579 is the LC number
that you, for your bill, is that correct?
Okay, so the motion is for do pass,
for Senate Bill 4EX of the LC number that I just read.
All of those in favor, raise your hand.
Did you get those?
Thank you.
And all of those opposed, raise your hand.
Thank you.
So the motion fails.
I think it is the appropriate time I make a motion we do pass Senate bill 1EX LC number 47258 for we have a motion is there a second we have a second is there any discussion
I've listened to the debate and the impassioned comments of many members of this committee and I can't
Overstate my affection and respect for the Dean of the Senate, for the minority whip,
the minority leader, and I can't put myself in your shoes.
The whip just made a great argument about historical discrimination, voter suppression.
There were times in our state's history where the Democratic Party would not allow African
Americans to vote in their primaries.
That is obviously changed.
For the better.
There was a reputed history in the south of discrimination against black voters, which
is why we have the Voting Rights Act in Section 2, which brings us here today.
And I think we're selling ourselves short not to acknowledge and recognize the progress
that we have made as a state in working together in stopping the past practices of discrimination.
And now we come here today and the echoes of these arguments resonate still in this room
and our behavior has changed and it's modified.
And we are following the law.
And I voted for the 2021 plan believing and having been advised by legal counsel that
it was nondiscriminatory.
Most of the opposition to it was partisan opposition.
And like they say, you can't take politics out of politics.
That's understandable.
We all have thick skin and we can take that.
Jones, who is a personal friend of mine, sees this otherwise, and he believes that to
comply with Section 2, we can create to additional African-American majority districts.
If he thought we could create 3, 4, 5, 6 more, he would have put that in the order.
But he said, based essentially on the demographics of Georgia where you have a 31 percent African-American
population, we ought to be able to create two more. And he showed us the areas with high
African-American concentration of population in the South Metro Atlanta area where we can
do it. Well, the chairman has done it. She has created the maximum amount of majority
minority districts that Judge Jones believes is possible in the areas where he thinks is
possible. So we are doing our very best to comply. The only difference between
these two plans, they're both creating those districts in the area required or
suggested by the judge, is that the Democratic plan has partisan advantages
where they add to Democratic seats and the chairman's plan does not. So let's
Let's stop the debate about the racial components because both plans comply with what the judge
requested and it's the maximum amount of African American participation.
Any suggestions of voter suppression are simply inaccurate.
The voting data shows we had the highest African American turnout ever in the history of
this state after these maps were passed.
And we had the high voter turnout.
Nobody's votes are being suppressed.
Some people aren't electing the candidates.
They won't.
A lot of Republicans weren't happy that we have two
Republican United States senators, but we do.
And we all work together and live together.
And there's always the next election
where you can go advocate and fight.
but there has been no proof of any voters
not being allowed to vote or their votes not being counted.
The issue here was, can African-American voters
elect the candidate of their choice?
And because of our racially polarized voting,
that leaks into racial majorities and minorities
in different districts.
What I hope for, as a Republican, is the day
That as a Republican party, we can persuade African-American voters that we are their candidate
choice, regardless of our race.
And it's more of a political discussion, and I don't want us to lose sight of the fact
that we have made tremendous advances in this state on the treatment of minorities, not
just African-American minorities, but all minorities.
In the state Senate itself, we have 18 non-white members right now.
That's over a third of the 56 Senators, and we're about to have very likely two more
and less weekend persuade voters of color to elect Republicans, and we'll see that we
can do that.
And I just, I want the public to recognize that that's our split right now, you know,
as we have eight, we have a third of the Senate, our minorities, and it's going to increase.
And it is an inclusive state that we have for everybody.
We always said that Atlanta and Georgia were too busy to hate.
And I like to see that our state government continues to operate the same way.
I think the chairman's plan equally addresses those concerns of racial discrimination
without changing any partisan advantage that the current system has, and I soundly endorse
it.
Thank you.
Any more discussion?
Okay.
Okay, then, at this point, well, I guess it's time to vote on LC 472584.
That is Senate Bill 1EX.
All of those in favor of the motion do pass.
Raise your hand.
I'm sorry, I'm not there.
All of those opposed to the motion do the same, raise your hand.
Thank you.
The motion passed.
That concludes our meetings on the Senate redistricting maps.
I'll entertain a motion to dismiss to adjourn.
move to have a second. I don't need it. Okay meeting is adjourned we've made
the motion we've second we're out.
