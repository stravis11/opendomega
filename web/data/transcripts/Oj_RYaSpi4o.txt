TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
If you would, please come in and have a seat, and we'll call the meeting to order.
Okay Chairman Anderson you want to come up and explain substitute the Senate bill 12
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will attempt to do what you have asked me to do
Senate bill 12 is
Originally was a relatively short bill that simply defined custodian when it came to the question of open records requests
And this is still in the bill.
Okay, it's section two, I believe it is of the bill now.
So I'll talk about that first, but the original bill did was to,
actually it's section three now with the rewrite of it.
But it defines custodian, it directs that all requests for public records.
She'll be made upon a custodian.
It also says that private persons or entities, she'll provide the custodian
with those records upon requests if they are in the public records and that they shall
maintain those in accordance with statutory requirements as far as time frame and that
sort of thing. And then we in in the the sub we've gone further and added the word public
in many sections in front of the word record simply because public record is defined
but just the simple word record is not in the code as amended.
That is that portion of it.
Now, I'm going to drop back to Section 1.
And Section 1 is relatively simple.
It excludes, and I'm going to read this to make sure I get everyone.
It says, we're talking about agency.
And this would be an agency subject to open records request.
Such terms shall not include the legislative branch,
including but not limited to the General Assembly and its members, officers, staff, committees,
commissions and offices.
We currently have and utilize legislative privilege on our conversations internally.
What this does is this extends that to our conversations with other departments primarily
in the executive branch.
That's my understanding as to the purpose of this.
And there's a lot of, and just my commentary here, there's a whole lot of pages in here
where nothing is done.
So the two and a half page bill went to 34 pages, but the bulk of those pages, there are
no changes too.
So I'm going to jump over to page 10, I believe it is.
And this is under the reference to code section 50-18-72.
This was a recommendation from the Prosecuting Attorney's Council.
Just to, and what I'd like to do, if I may, Mr. Chairman, could I invoke the call of friend
option and let Chairman Leveritt explain this portion where there's just a couple of lines
added to this code section?
Chairman Leveritt.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, Chairman Anderson, I didn't think you needed any help, you're doing great.
But so this is the statute 50, 1872, which are the exceptions to the Open Records Act.
And one of them are records of law enforcement, or lighting to a pending investigation.
But there's an exception to that exception, even if there is a pending investigation,
the traditionally the word used in the code was the initial incident report, was still
something that law enforcement will have to tinder in response to an open records request.
We're sort of clarifying that a little bit by making it the first incident report completed
on a standard incident report form to clarify what is the exception to the exception.
And then there's also a provision in that exception that says, well, but at some point
But you can't use this exception about a pending investigation when the investigation is
really pretty much over.
And we're just finally, the language was when all the rec litigation involving the investigation
and prosecution has become final or otherwise terminated, PAC is asked to clarify that because
I think there's been some disagreement about what that means to upon a final disposition
of the accusation indictment or complaint and exhaustion of any right of appeal for all
individuals charged on the same accusation indictment or complaint.
So that was a, I think, of some just kind of, I guess you could consider it clean up or clarification that they requested to that particular provision in the exemption statute.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Then we jump to page 26 in the current version where there is added on line 677 and 678
a reference to the Department of Human Services which I would expect is was an omission in the
original text of the statute that needed to be added to make sure we cover the appropriate
departments within that section then the last provision that I have seen in the current
rewrite of this occurs on chapter or excuse me page 30 where there are additional references
to as I mentioned earlier the communications between the legislative branch and the
executive branch Mr. Chairman I will okay be glad to attempt to get a
couple of questions with part. Thank you Mr. Chairman Chairman Anderson you
are right there on page 30 with respect to line 769 to 777 why is the
majority party trying to expand from disclosure or to keep private
communications between the legislative branch and a private person or a private entity.
Does that not greatly expand non-disclosure laws?
What are y'all trying to protect?
And then what are you trying to hide, I should say?
And then on line 774 to 777, again, we are excluding from public disclosure
or keeping hidden from the public movements within a building, any sort of government building.
Can you help me better explain why we are trying to hide more information from the public,
especially when legislators are engaged in conversations or receive information from
a private person or a private entity?
If you'll give me one second, sir, let me just make sure, again, I was just given a fresh
re-rattle, some of this.
So, Chamberlabor, if you look at this portion, we'll need to.
Yes.
Well, first of all, I appreciate the sense of loving kindness in which you asked the question,
you know, what are you trying to hide?
I don't think we're trying to hide anything.
There's currently existing under law, legislative privilege, and which protects conversations that
we have with people about legislation.
This is just saying, just because it ends up a document or a communication being in the hands of the executive branch doesn't remove the legislative privilege, it's still exempt from the open record.
My concern, I do have concern between further protecting conversations between the legislative and the executive branch, but again, this subsection 54, with respect to private persons or private entities and the performance of a service or function for the legislative branch.
Well, generally my understanding is if I have a private conversation with someone about
legislation, legislative privilege applies to that.
So are you saying to simply codifies existing laws?
Well, if it does, it just makes, if you have a written record of the communication that just
exempts them from the open records, which just simply kind of furthers the existence of the
privilege, otherwise the privilege doesn't really mean anything.
And I would think there are times when we have conversations
that involve we rely on people to give us honest information.
And if they think that we're going to have to say what they told us,
they might not be as truthful with us about it or as forthright.
I would respectfully disagree, I think,
as elected officials subject and how accountable to the people.
I think the people should have the right, would you not agree,
to know where certain information that impacts and influences legislation,
where that comes from, whether it is a extremist organization,
whether it is a foreign billionaire,
I think the people are subject to that information
of which my understanding and plain reading of this language
is that that would protect those sorts of conversations
and communications.
Sorry, I'm gonna talk to you.
I mean, I respect the opinion.
I agree that's a different policy,
but I think it's more important to get accurate information.
And my understanding of the privilege is that that's the policy that's been adopted by the application of the privilege and that's why the privilege exists in the first place.
And also you would ask about electronic access system. My understanding is that has to do with the security systems here and the codes and without that people could get access to all of the codes and be able to access building without being tracked.
That's part of the reason for that, because I'll know you didn't ask about that, but you did you did make some references up
We're trying to hide our goings and comings. That's not what's going on. We appreciate it has a question
Thank you chairman is for bringing the bill isn't it true chairman that the federal government recognizes a much broader legislative
Privilege than the state of Georgia and this this language is in line with that legislative privilege
that the federal government utilizes.
It is my understanding, sir.
Isn't it also true that the key words in line 777 and 777
and the performance of a service or function of legislative branch
and to the point of Vice Chair that when we are performing
our legislative function, in other words having conversations
about legislation or excuse me putting together legislation
If we want those honest conversations,
then folks don't want to be subject to any type of request
of the information.
And this is just clearly an opportunity for us
to maintain a good piece of, or excuse me,
it's an opportunity for us to just align ourselves
with a much broader legislative privilege, is that true?
I would say yes sir and if I may further with that just to speak on behalf of my colleagues
who are not attorneys and seasoned in the ins and outs of law it is difficult sometimes
for us to determine what conversations we have in the course of conducting the business
of the state and the legislature that are protected or not.
So what this does is for all of us it provides a clarity and provides a definitive answer
to me of that question that those conversations in the course of doing my legislative duties
are protected.
Okay.
We had a question of Mr. Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the Chairman of the podium.
The parts of the bill that were other than the 39 lines or so that you said were the
original Senate Bill 12 has any of the language, including the language we just been discussing
at 767 to 7777 and then the other new language that wasn't part of the original.
Has any of that, was that any of that in a bill that went through any substantive committee
on either the House or the Senate side for any vetting?
I do not know the answer to that question.
How did it come to you?
It came to me as a sub, a rules committee sub that I am here presenting.
As far as you know, this language, it may have not been ever vetted at all, other than
what we're doing right here.
I can't speak to what may have been presented in the past.
I'm not knowledgeable of any presentation of this this session.
Well, if anybody on the committee knows and would be up to the chairman if they could
share now, but maybe they could share with me later.
other question back on line 769. I understand the point that the whip and the
vice chairman were making about our legislative privilege and I don't
disagree with that but this this language at line 769 wouldn't you agree is
way broader because this says records are data relating to the legislative
branch. I'm not really sure what that is. Also it's going to protect just straight
date up data that an agency may create, an agency may create a spreadsheet summarizing
information.
It may summarize dollars relating to some budget item and maybe that data was originally
the request of someone from the legislature but it's not its data, just like the attorney
client privilege doesn't protect data, it protects communications and advice.
This is going way further in protecting underlying data that perhaps we may request in a study
committee that the public certainly has a right to know does that do you
read it as broad as I do and does that not concern you I will defer also
again later to lines 170 171 where it does say that in the performance of a
service or function of the legislative branch or on behalf of the legislative
branch. Right. The data and the information, the records that would be covered in this would
only be for the purpose of the performance of that function. But when you agree that any data
perhaps that the budget office prepares that summarizes dollars, reserves, spending over time,
ups and downs, that's all probably requested from someone in this body. But the data
is not part of our legislative thinking and crafting that I think the
legislative privilege is designed to protect. Why are we trying to protect data
and information in our state government from the public? I would have to say
you'll have your opinion on that again. My basis for supporting this would be the
in the performance of a service or function. Do you agree that that should be
shielded from the public. If we ask the budget office to create summaries of
reserves and ups and downs and projections, do you agree that the public
shouldn't see that just because perhaps the budget chairman asked an office to
create it? I can't speak to every circumstance. I know there are circumstances
when I do think that should be yes. Thank you. 15 Miller has a question. Thank
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author of the bill on line 237-338, where we do quote-unquote
clean up, oftentimes in investigations, criminal investigations are multiple incident reports
and initial incident reports.
officers for example can respond to the scene and give an incident report based
on their observations. Is this meant to and those are routinely produced because
they are incident reports? When we say first initial the first initial report for
any officer or any investigation can you just tell me what we're what we're
trying to do with this? I appreciate the question. I cannot answer that question.
I would again defer to my learning colleague, Chairman Liberty, if I may, Mr. Chairman.
It's answering the lady's question.
As I read it, it's talking about the first incident report prepared.
And my understanding is there is generally one incident report prepared for an investigation
that's the initial one that's done.
And that would be attainable in open records.
Now, this doesn't impact what you could get through discovery in the criminal case.
No, no, no.
Thank you.
We're just talking about what is subject and available by way of open records.
It is the intention to limit the amount of information that folks can get on a case
through the open records.
I think that you could get through to a pending case that's still being prosecuted.
Yes, I think it's intended to limit it to what I think customarily at least I've always
understood as the city attorney was what you had to produce.
Okay, and then to the broader scope of what I think this bill is trying to do, I guess
my question to the author is normally in, for example, attorney client privilege or
work product privilege or psychiatrist patient privilege, there are boundaries, there are
things that you have to establish. It is limited in scope. It can be waived. It does not
protect, for example, crime or fraud. And I'm wondering if you are contemplating in this
privilege, is it really as broad as anything that is communicated to a legislator in the
process of them doing their job as a legislator, anything, any conversation, any record, any
piece of data, is that what we're really trying to do here?
First of all, my answer to that question upon reading what we have in front of us here
is there is nothing that would prevent the waving of the privilege or voluntarily participating
and that sort of thing, but as far as whether it is intended to cover anything, again, I defer
back to line 770 and 771, that is in the performance of a service or function of the legislative
branch or it won't be half of the legislative branch.
So if it is in that performance and function, it would be covered under this, but those
other provisions, the other exceptions and exclusions you spoke of, there's nothing
I'll see you in here that we've heard of it then.
Thank you.
I'd do, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask about the CARBA on 55 and just if there's an explanation
for those records which are the access records to the buildings, I think there's some oversight
aspect of whether or not somebody was actually working that day and so if you can share just
a little bit behind that. Is it a safety thing or something else?
To who I'm ever can answer it. Yeah, it's line 774 to 777. So
the exception 55. Yes. Yeah, that's my understanding is is without that
exemption. All of our the codes that that are maintained by us could be subject
to open records arguably. And it is a matter of not only of safety, but also
security in the building because if you know all the codes then you can make your own card and come
any time. You're talking to a guy who's more analog than I am digital but that was my understanding
of the need for that exception. I could understand the codes but it would seem whether or not we were
using the access cards to actually access the building should still be subject to being disclosed.
Well, again, we're not talking about disclosure of facts.
We're talking about production of documents here.
So these are electronic or tangible three-dimensional documents.
So you could get electronic documents or electronic data
relating to all that information, which would allow you basically
to hack the whole security system.
OK.
All right, thank you.
That's my recollection as it was explained to an old guy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the chairman presenting the bill.
Just a point of clarification in line 767, it talks about the legislative branch, any
members, officers, et cetera.
And then when you go to the line 7679 and later it just says the legislative branch.
So does that mean that anyone that's a member of the
legislative branch this applies to, or does it apply to like an official committee or
the House itself, explains me for clarification, what are we saying now?
If I can try and answer the lady's question, again this is the open records act.
So this is an act that provides generally that you have access to public records.
There are a number of exceptions to that, and we're adding three exceptions.
There is already, at least understand, a legislative privilege that applies to communications
and some written communications as well.
But the Open Records Act is not a plot of the legislature.
It has not, since it was enacted, the Court of Appeals has said it on the plot of the legislature.
But it would a plot of executive branch agencies.
So this is just adding as another exemption communications they have with legislative
branch or members, et cetera, there are.
So again, we're talking about a request for production of documents relating to these
matters.
These things would be exempt from disclosure under the Open Records Act.
It doesn't necessarily mean you can't get it in litigation.
That's a different matter.
So I have to understand then that where it says legislative branch in several of these
places that includes members as well as official committees and what I want to.
But you're not you couldn't make an open records act request to the lady as a member of
the legislature.
It would be made to an executive branch or executive agency and this would be an exception
to the things they would be required to produce in response to.
One other thing Mr. Chairman and this is not exactly a question but I'm a little bit concerned
that nobody knows where this came from.
And what is the urgency that brings us here
on the 39th day at this hour?
And I suppose I don't know.
I think it was just felt it would be good to put this
in law while we had an opportunity to do so to clarify
and to further sort of clean up some issues
that have arisen, you know,
The bill was initially because we had a court case
that I think interpreted requests made to vendors
who contract with local governments.
And the understanding has always been,
you had to make the request to the local government
and the local government has to track down the vendor
and get the documents if they're responsible.
That's responsible.
The Court of Appeals read it differently.
So we were trying initially in the bill to clean that up.
Well, there've also been some Court of Appeals cases
and that the legislature is not subject to open records
and open meetings, so we were cleaning that up,
and then we were just adding these legislative privileges
in here as well.
So it was not viewed really as being a substantive change,
but just as confirming what I think
is already a reasonable extension of existing law.
Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure who this question
will be direct to, but isn't it true that some years ago
There was open records issues around, back in the day when we had toll booths about the tags being able to be when people went in and out of that under open records.
They were at one time subject of the operators and isn't true.
The reason we took that away was because it was a security risk.
People knew when people were in their home or not and to that, isn't it true that 55 if this data were open, they would know if somebody were going to do something, you know,
and Ellen tended to a member of this legislature,
a member of our staff.
They would know the goings in the Cummings
and when they were in and out of the building
and it's a safety issue
because these are public records,
a private company would never do that.
Isn't that what we're trying to get here?
I mean, that's my understanding of 55 anyway.
That's what that night point is.
Is it secure?
Chairman, if I may,
as further clarification with what Chairman Lebritt said,
and I think to the point of what Chairman Martin
I was asking there in some of the notes that the Speaker's Office had provided me on
this exception 55 for security purposes, such that no one could access data to track
an individual's movements within a state building.
So yes, it is probably, exception 55 is primarily for security purposes for each of you.
Okay, I have one last question, Mr. Milton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the second bite of the apple.
Just something occurred to me.
I guess I missed it when Chairman Leveritt indicated
that this is really more so designed
to protect communications between the General Assembly
and the executive branch.
And I'm wondering, I know that this session,
there has been what I understand
to be a whole lot of communication
between the executive branch
and the legislative branch about a certain priority.
And I'm wondering if this isn't,
if this is being done at this time in an attempt
to shield the level of communication,
pressure, exertion, all the other things
that we've all talked about on the floor,
is that what this is designed to cover?
No, no, this has nothing to do
with any legislative initiatives that have been launched.
this year. It's just, this was simply viewed as an opportunity to, again, make some clean
up that was, you know, was desired and was not viewed as being that great a substantive
change. No grant conspiracy here. Okay. And the further that, it is my understanding
that it is very rare that we have bills related to section 50-18 in this code section.
So as the chairman alluded to, most of these additions to the original bill were done to
address issues that have come up over the last few years in communications and dealings
through the courts on other issues as well as concerns for the prosecuting attorney's
counsel and what we've seen out of the court for appeals.
Okay.
We've heard the explanation and the questions on this.
On Senate bill 12, by substitute, is there a motion to do pass?
Motion do pass have a motion and a second to do pass is in opposition is
objection all those in favor say aye all those opposed no
It passes
Okay, thank you
Next Senate bill 20 by substitute chairman martin
Thanks chairman parish
Ladies and gentlemen, this Senate bill 20 is in five parts
The first portion of the bill parts one through three
We're originally passed by this body this rules committee in this house earlier this year as house bill
56
Those are as pass those parts one through
Three of the bill part four of the bill is the original
Senate bill 20 which passed out of
House higher ed and in part five is just the implementation
So we have two pieces of legislation that have been vetted in the House Higher Ed Committee.
One of those past what is in House Bill 56 to or what was in House Bill 56 to help everyone's memory
was to extend to fallen public safety officers, spouses, an opportunity for education.
And part three of the bill is to make that same extension
for public school teachers, public school professionals
that are killed in a lot of duty.
And unfortunately, we had our first and I hope only
to this fall, but that's what parts two and three
of the bill, part one of the bill allows checkoffs.
At the time you're getting your drivers license
if you want to help fund these scholarships.
That's what the bill does, Mr. Chairman.
Okay, any questions, Kevin Martin?
Don't see any questions.
You'll hear a motion of substitute
to Senate Bill 22 pass.
I have a motion and a second is any opposition?
Okay, it passes.
Okay, now let's set a third supplemental calendar
for today.
Senate Bill 12 by substitute,
LC 47, 37, 21, Fs.
have a motion in a second is our position okay all those in favor of putting it
on say aye all those opposed no it's on Senate bill 20 rule substitute LC 61
zero two six six yes is there a motion have a motion in a second in your
position. It's on Senate Bill 36. I have a motion and a second in the
opposition. There's objection. All those in favor say aye. I'll suppose no.
I'll save it.
He's going to pick that up and bring it back just a minute, okay?
Okay, while we're weighing on that, Senate Bill 46 have a motion and a second in the
position. It's on. And Senate bill 255. Moving second in any opposition. There is an objection.
Okay. All those in favor of Senate bill 255 going on say aye. Any opposed?
No. No. No. I just have it. Okay. Just sit tight for just a minute. Okay.
You
You
You
You
Okay, everyone have a copy of the proposed amendment AM 44-0228.
We can have a copy of the proposed amendment, AM 44-0228, okay.
Representative Evans, you want to explain your amendment, please.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ladies and gentlemen, the committee, this is a proposed amendment to send a bill 36.
It simply adds to the end of line 67 of the bill.
It already says benefits or exemptions, so it would just replace line 67 with the following.
So it would say nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination and violation
of a federal or state civil rights law or a local civil rights ordinance or resolution.
The author of the bill has indicated both in judiciary committee and in the press that
he does not intend Senate Bill 68 to be a tool for discrimination.
So this just simply clarifies that that is true.
It is language that you will find in other state laws around the same subject matter also
in conservative states such as Texas have language similar to this and it just ensures
that while we place value on religious freedom, we also want to make sure that no one in our
state will be discriminated against and this just allows that balancing that I think all
of us would like to have due unto others as we would have those due unto us and again,
I'm not asking for this to be the rules to substitute this in.
I'm asking for us to utilize the procedure that is provided for in House Rule 33.2 that says a modified structured rule bill which this is can have an amendment approved by the rules committee to have placed on the floor.
And then whether myself or some other member attempts to move that is something that happens on the house floor.
I'm simply asking that this committee allow this amendment to be placed on the House desk for having the ability to be potentially moved in the House. That's all I'm asking.
Okay. You've heard the proposed amendment and you've heard the motion that it be placed that rules pass it out and place it on the floor. Is there a second to this motion? There is a second. Okay. All those in favor of moving this to the floor will say aye.
All those opposed will say no no okay all those who want to send this forward raise your hand
Okay, all those opposed
Motion fails
Excuse me, symbol 36 is part of the supplemental calendar.
We had a motion, do pass, or be added to the calendar, is any opposition, objection,
all those in favor of adding this to the calendar, say aye, all those opposed, no, it's
added on.
Okay.
That's it.
Thank you.
Thank you for your patience.
You
