you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you President, there is no journal. So I didn't read it. So you, but I'm sure it would have been correct. Had we had one? No, there is no journal today, but I will tell you this about the senator from the eighth, and I might want you to take a point of personal privilege. There was a over the Christmas holidays, we have a local radio station, and we always have a Elvis Christmas day special. That my sister has been sponsoring on the local radio program for quite some time, and I, she asked me to be on, and I said, well, that's fine, but the only person I know who is a historian on Elvis Presley is our good friend from Valdosta, Georgia, or Senator from the eighth. And right now, I'm still getting requests from local folks there about when am I going to bring that man back to town because he was one of the most entertaining people they had listened to. So I'm even thought he was a comedian on the radio show. So Senator, when you come in, there's a great quote that you always give. Elvis Presley quote that you give that he says before, and you do it into his voice, and come on up here and share that with the Senate real quick. Well, thank you, Mr. President, happy birthday, Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley used to have a song called Walk of Mylon, my shoes, and of course he was a great humanitarian. He pretty much gave away everything that he ever made. But before he sang that song, Walk of Mylon, my shoes, he recited a poem, and I think it's kind of fitting for just life in general, and how we need to treat each other, and it goes like this. You never stood in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, or stood and watched what helped us hands while a heart inside him dies. So help your brother along the way, no matter where he starts, for the same God that made you, made him too. These men were broken hearts. I'd like to sing a song along the same line. God bless y'all. Good job, Senator. That was not, that was not a hers. I just put him on the spot, so that's pretty good. But it's good to have, it's good to have all the spouses, and I see some children, and everything else that are here today. I've got my crew here today. I've got a Jan, and y'all stand up and take a Jan in banks and Stella here. I'd say it's, I'd lick the picture from a year ago today, and it's hard to believe in one year how much the kids have grown, but at any rate it's, it's, it's, grow out and glad they're here. And, and as y'all well know, it, it takes a family effort, being public service, and, and we're great. I know we're one in this room, it's grateful as I am of, of our family. So, anyways, we are glad to be here today, and the sector. We, oh, we've got the JQC appointments, that's right. So, Secretary will read the communications Supreme Court requesting, sitting confirmation of its appointment to the judicial qualifications committee. Mr. President, the Senate has received communications from the governor, speaker, and House of Representatives, and Supreme Court of Georgia, requesting that the Senate confirm the following appointments to the judicial qualifications commission. Miss Victoria Derrassal, a copy of these communications have been placed on each senator's desk. That completes the order, Mr. President. Presumably to the Senate rules of 3.1, the appointment is referred to the committee on assignments. It is now time for the morning roll call. Are there any motions to excuse? Senator from the 33rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning and happy new years, y'all. I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 38th for business outside the Capitol. Without objection, Senator from 38th is it excused? Is any other motions to excuse? Hearing none, the secretary will start the roll calls, signify your presence by voting the A-switch. Secretary? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. It is now time for the morning devotion. All senators will take their seats and all audible conversation will cease and the door capers secure the chamber. I've got the pleasure today of having our senator here today. I mean, having our pastor today today, but I want to tell you a little bit more about him. Right after our pledge of allegiance to the flag, so let me lead us in and pledge allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for just standing one nation under God, indivisible, for the good of the Kingdom of Justice for all. Georgia flag? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the flag of the Kingdom of Justice for all. Today it is an honor. I've got pastor Jared McClendon here with me today and he's as you will be able to see, he's also a member of the law enforcement there in Clayton County and has been for quite some time. He and I cross pass this past year and something that be here and I both are very passionate about and that is in youth football. His son, Caleb, who's here with us today, was on the team and of course my little boy banks were on the fifth and sixth grade team. I was on the wrong rock and I told somebody that I would help coach but they're going to have to find him a head coach. I couldn't do, because I couldn't deal with momless and deadies talking about little Johnny and I play in. So I needed a head coach. I needed a coach from McClendon and we got to know one another and I usually when a gentleman comes in there and their child is on the team.

Sometimes you get accused of doing daddy ball. You know, as Jan would tell me often, she goes, don't be a daddy ball coach, you know. But I saw real quick that Coach McClendon kind of had a lot of philosophies like me when it comes to raising their children and he didn't cut his, any more, any breaks that he wouldn't. He was treating his kids just like he was treating everybody else, you know, and just like I always do. But we grew, we really started a real tight friendship there. And then I found out he was a pastor of a church there in Henry County and has a great, great following. He is somebody that I have a lot of respect for. And he and I had a lot of fun this past football season. Coach, you know, these young gentlemen, they were trying now at times. You know, I will tell you that. I hadn't, I hadn't coached football in a long time, especially youth league and it's a different, it's a different caliber of kid out there right now. But my wife was excited that I had a preacher coaching alongside of me because she said, well, at least I know you won't be dropping any language. You don't need to be around those kids. I was like, yeah, you're probably right. So, but we had a lot of fun and won some, won a lot of games but better than that, we built close bonds, not just with the kids, but also the coaches that we were able to work with. And I'm honored to have him here today. I'm honored to have his wife and his son here today and look forward and I hope you'll pay close attention to the message that he has for us today. Thank you. Welcome to 2024 Georgia. I'm gonna say that one more time, he said, I'm a pastor, you see the police uniform, I'm gonna try that one more time. I said, welcome to 2024 Georgia. I preached a message two weeks ago called, release the baggage. Whatever you did in 2023 is gone. It's now time to start over and new beginnings. Is that all right? Given honor to God, who's ahead of my life, to my lovely wife, Mr. Patrice McClendon, I brought some guests with me, Lieutenant Jones, I bought Dr. Walker, my chief of police, my supervisor, Lieutenant David Pajouz, and I esteemed board president, Miss Jessie Goree. Applause. I'll be about, won't be long, I'll be about five minutes strong. Is that all right? Like Lieutenant Jones said, I met him and we just bonded. I want to think about Kenji's spirits. We have so much in common. And I call him now my brother from another mother. He's been honest with me, loves my son, loves the coach, loves children, but most of all, he loves God. And all our conversations were based on that. And when I got the invitation to do this, God said, tell the state of Georgia these words, second chronicles, seven and 14. And it reads, if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray, seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then we will heal from heaven. And he will forgive our sin and he will heal our land. Georgia, all we have to do is humbile selves. Let us be the light that shines out of darkness. We're in a dark hour in this country now. Wars, rumors of wars. Things are taking place that we thought we would never see. But one thing I know about this state, this is a praying state. And that's why we can come together, no matter what you believe, wanna call it one state. Let us pray. Father, we thank you right now. We lift you up, God, we magnify you and we make you bigger than anything. Lord, you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves. Lord, I come asking as your servant to forgive us for our sins, seen and unseen by all mission or court mission, God. Blood out our transgressions. Hide us behind your cross. Every county, every city that's represented right now, God, we present them to you, God. We actually, the turn was going on in this world, Lord. Let us turn back to you. Lord, I lift up God, the governor of this state. Look on him right now, God, touch his family. Lord, look on the lieutenant governor, God, Bert Jones, look on this family, God. Give these men the mind of the learned, the tongue of the intellect to lead this state, God. Touch everyone under the sound of my voice, God. Now, God, you be true, you be humble. We thank you right now, God, for what you gonna do and what you have done. God, I'm asking you to go to every hospital. Go to every corner, touch those that are bound by habits, touch the homeless, the sick and shut in. Touch those children, God, right now, they don't have anyone. Go to the mental health center, God. Touch right now, like never before. Lord, we bless you and we thank you. We thank you right now, God, for what you're gonna do. According to Proverbs chapter three, verses five, six and seven, we trust in you, God, with all our heart. We won't lean to our own understanding. In all our ways, we acknowledge you. And you said this word, God, you shall. Shadows of promise. You shall direct our paths. We thank you right now, God. We give you the glory, certainly on in the praise. In Jesus name, let us all say, Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen again. Lieutenant Bert Jones has been on honor and a privilege. I thank you, I thank you. You've been nothing but honors and fair to me and my family. God bless you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Sunshine Boulder. It's always a pleasure to have the opportunity to visit and introduce our doctor of the day. We greatly appreciate all the work that the physicians have volunteered their time to come down here and the gentleman we have today, I'm going to let the senator from the

30 second, introduce him, Dr. Kaufman. This marks his 35th year coming down here. 35th year coming down here. That's really amazing. I told me it looks too young to be able to do this for 35 years, but I'm going to call the senator from the 32nd. Thank you, Governor. I hope that you all will pay close attention to this introduction because it's not often that I get turned to do. Somebody really special is Dr. the day and a good friend of mine for many years. Dr. Bobby Kaufman, Robert Kaufman we call him Bobby. Since 1989, he's been practicing internal medicine at the Kaufman Clinic with offices in Atlanta and Woodstock. He's a graduate of UGA and earned his medical degree at Moore House and he completed his residency at Emory School of Medicine. His father, Dr. James Kaufman, started the Doctor of the Day program here in Georgia. So we owe the Kaufman family a great debt. Dr. Kaufman has a vast experience with weight loss and fitness, which is a good thing to talk about here in early January when many of us are starting our healthy resolutions. At age 19, he weighed 270 pounds and by age 21, he weighed 185 pounds. As of 2021, he still weighs 185 pounds and he's a big believer in daily aerobic exercise and core weight training. So we're gonna have to figure out a plan here, people. Dr. Kaufman's a lifelong resident of Atlanta where he resides with his wife and twins. He's very involved with the Georgia Alzheimer's association. As founder and Atlanta board member. Since 1999, he's been chair of the James A. Kaufman golf tournament, which has raised over $4 million for the Georgia Alzheimer's foundation. So knowing that this is Dr. Kaufman's 35th year of serving as Doctor of the Day, I hope that you will all take the opportunity to meet him. He's a huge advocate for what we do down here in his very original process. Thank you, Dr. Kaufman. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's an honor to be here. Yes, this is my 35th year. But I've only been here 34 years because last year, I was in Los Angeles at the National Championship game. So it was much, well, it was a great time. I wish I was in Houston right now, but unfortunately that's not the case. But over 35 years, I've been through a lot down here, made a lot of great friends and have thoroughly enjoyed it. And the service that we provide is somebody asked me today. If you had some cases that are down here, I was just remember looking up at the stairs. We had one year, we had somebody fall and was lodged in up the stair up there that we had to get out. But I truly enjoy being here. I had a great role model in my father. And I'm a correct K that we're now up to $5.5 million that we've raised for the Alzheimer's research. So I have a lot of very generous friends. But as you all know, that the role we provide, and that's what we're here for, but there's really one person that's much more important than the doctor the day. It's Julia Mac over there, who runs the station, knows everybody. So she's the one who deserves all the credit because she does all the hard work. Julia wave at everybody. But again, if I can be of any service, my office is just a mile away, and I'm happy to help anybody any time. They'll have a great day. At this time, the secretary has a resolution that they would like to introduce to the chamber SR-431. Secretary. Senate resolution 430 by Senators Kennedy of the 18th and others. A resolution to notify the House of Representatives that the Senate has convened and for other purposes. That can be seen. Mr. President. Does the pro-Cham wish to speak to the resolution? Pro-Cham has waved. And does the Senate any objection to the resolution? Chair here is none. And the question on the SR-431, if there's no objections, will be adopted. We have another resolution. At this time, I appoint the following Senators as the Committee of Notification. Sorry. Secretary, read the resolution. Senate resolution 431. A resolution by Senators Kennedy of the 18th and others. A resolution to notify the governor that the General Assembly has convened and for other purposes. That completes the order, Mr. President. At this time, I appoint the following without objection. Is there objections to the resolutions? I'm sorry. Now, with no objection, I knew you were going to be in a friendly mood today. That's why I was trying to jump ahead here. With no objections, the resolutions are adopted. This time, I appoint the following Senators. Senators from the 18th, the Pro-Cham, Senators from the 51st, Senators from the 55th, Senators from the 50th, Senators from the 3rd, and Senators from the 15th, the Dean of the Senate. I would ask that all members of the committee meet the Secretary of the Senate at his desk immediately upon adjournment. Is there any unanimous concerns? Chair, here's none. We now, for any points of personal privilege, would any light stand for a point of personal privilege. My good friend, the Senator from the 14th, I hope you have a strong message for us today. Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning, colleagues. I have remarked with a couple of you already today that it's fun to be back in some respect. It is certainly an experience that brings a lot of cortisol to be in this building, to use a scientific term, stressful. But we are here, and we're here to do the people's work. I rise today to talk about the people's work and in the context of the swatting incidents that occurred over the last few weeks over the holidays against not just the Lieutenant Governor, the President of this Chamber, but also several members of this body. We live in a really dark time, and everybody knows that. We go about our business in this room. As though it is not as dark as it is sometimes. Because we have routines, and we work on legislation, we work on, and we hope some of this noise dies down. But make no mistake, there are people out there who would seek to use some of the scariest, most dangerous possible tools, threats, not only to put members of the government, serious risk of serious bodily harm, potentially worse, but to try to disrupt the normal operation of government. And make no mistake about who condemns these horrific and unjustifiable acts, every member of this chamber, people of both parties. I've had a lot of good conversations with members of both parties after these incidents, and the thing that those conversations have brought forth for me is the idea that the rational, level headed, stately way to handle these things, is to condemn them to make sure we have the information, to go get the information, to provide law enforcement with the tools they need to track down the folks who did this and hold them accountable. The answer is not to run to partisan corners of either side, and I've seen people on both sides make this mistake of assuming that they know everything about who did this and who's responsible. I think that we face a real challenge moving forward with this session in an election year where the risk of culture war is at its highest. And that is when it comes to the very basics of government, are we gonna do what's necessary? Not just to protect our members from a law enforcement of public safety perspective and protect the public at large, but are we gonna protect our shared commitment to govern for everybody and not assume the worst of each other at some of the most difficult, vulnerable moments that we face. I'm honored to serve with everybody in here. I want to extend again my sympathies to the folks who had to deal with the worst part of this, the stress of having your family open the door and not know why a police response was there or yourself. This is not just a problem affecting legislators, it affects a lot of people in the community, but it's with that shared sense of empathy and solidarity with one another, bipartisan, that I trust that we are going to move forward this session with a commitment to do the right thing, protect everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator. Senator from the 39th, which rise for a point of personal privilege. Good morning and thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I rise today with a deep sense of pride and honor to acknowledge a pivotal moment in the history of Atlanta, our great city. Today marks the 50th anniversary of Maynard Jackson's historic election as the first black mayor of Atlanta. In just a few minutes over in City Hall, they will also be doing a celebration of this, but I wanted to say here that Maynard Jackson's legacy is not just merely a chapter in Atlanta's history. It is a testament to the enduring power of leadership and the profound impact one individual can have on a community. His vision and determination laid a foundation that continues to shape our city to this day. As we reflect on Maynard Jackson's tenure, we're reminded of the transformative leadership he exemplified. He championed inclusivity, breaking barriers to ensure that all Atlanta had a seat at the table. His commitment to diversity and economic equality left an indelible mark creating opportunities that persist in our city's fabric. His foresight and strategic governance set the stage for Atlanta's growth and prosperity. His emphasis on building a strong economic foundation, investing in infrastructure, and fostering a sense of community pride has reverberated through the decades. We stand on the shoulders of the progress he initiated, benefiting from the vibrant and thriving Atlanta we know today. Notably, Maynard Jackson's leadership opened doors for subsequent generations, paving the way for the election of Atlanta's first black female mayor, Shirley Franklin, and a continued legacy of engaged leadership in our city seen today with Mayor Andre Dickens. His impact remains evident in the milestones we celebrate and the progress we continue to achieve. So as we commemorate this significant anniversary, let us not only honor the memory of Mayor Manor Jackson, but also recommit ourselves as we begin our 2024 session to the principles he championed. Let his legacy serve as a guiding light, inspiring us to build on the foundation he laid and to continue the work of creating a city and dare I say a state that is inclusive, equitable, and prosperous for all. May the spirit of Maynard Jackson's leadership continue to inspire us as we work together for the betterment of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and all of its residents. Thank you. I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'll find out. Thank you. The Senator from 56, you like their eyes on Point Personal Privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I commend the Senator from the 14th for talking about the issues that several of us faced at the end of last year in the beginning of this year. As many of you know, I think first was our Senator from the 45th, the 32nd, myself, the Senator from the 41st, our Lieutenant Governor, several other department heads were all swatted. And for those that don't understand what swatting means, let me take a moment to explain that. As when someone thinks they're making a prank telephone call and saying someone has been either shot or murdered, and they might be then holding some type of hostages, hanging up the phone, trying to solicit the police department to literally send a SWAT team and a cadre of other public safety vehicles to your house. This is extraordinarily dangerous first and foremost for the people who are responding, as they are driving full emergency in police cars, fire engines, ambulances, et cetera. It's very dangerous to the public as they are going through the streets, and it's very dangerous to the individuals who are in their home when that happens, not knowing what the outcome could be. This literally could have cost someone their life. And for those who think that this is a prank, it's actually a crime. I want to thank the senator from the 45th for leading the way on upcoming legislation that you will see that will add criminal and civil penalties on top of what already exists today. And I want to give a special thank to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia State Police and Capitol Police for their work in working with our local and federal counterparts in order to track down and bring those people to justice. You may also know that just a few days ago, someone emailed the bomb thread into our Capitol building as well as buildings throughout the entire United States. Again, these type of actions are both foolish and dangerous. You see a much increased police presence here at the Capitol today, and you'll continue to see that both visibly and non-visibly to make sure that each one of you and your families and your staff are protected. Thank you for your service and know that the men and women who service and law enforcement, our finest, are diligently working to bring people to justice. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Thanks, Senator. Senator from 31st, which reminds them of one of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to be brief. I just wanted to just share some comments and just let the family of Scotty Tillery and Cedar Town, Georgia, know that we're thinking about them. We just had the funeral for Scotty Tiller on Friday. And it's pretty hard, pretty emotional. I do want to recognize our senator from the 19th, who's cousins, family of this man who is born in Rome, Georgia, who's had a tremendous impact for basically a generation or more on-po County, Georgia, and Cedar Town served as a city commissioner for a number of years, and as a county commissioner, said just want to lift up, amri, his wife, his sons, his brother Rocky, and the entire Cedar Town community as they continue to grieve. This man that was bigger than life and bigger than many of us probably would experience in a lifetime and be on a generation as a Georgian. So Scotty, thank you for everything you've done for me as an individual in my family. And we love the Tilleries. That was Mr. President, I yield. Thanks, Senator. Senator from 36. Point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. It's great to see all of us back together, and our numbers are strong and staunch, and let us all come together to work to do the right thing. I wanted to follow the comments of the gentleman from the 14th, as well as the gentleman from the 56th, then others. We've all heard the old adage about the lobster, doesn't know what's happening, cause the water heats up so slow, and then all of a sudden you're boiled as a lobster. I think that the climate that we're in in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this state, and in this nation, is dangerously like a pot of water, with a lot of heat under it, but haven't got up all the way to 212 yet, where it's gonna spill over. But we are on the way, and we all understand the phenomenon of behaviors that occur and start to appear normal. I've thought several times over these last weeks, as colleagues, no matter their party affiliation, no matter their title or non-title, but open the door to armed police, who've been summoned zapped to your home as an harassment. And the level of security that we just come to count on increasingly, that everything's, you've got to be on guard constantly. You've got to really worry who can get a hold of your address, or who knows where your child goes to school. Remember, this is not normal. We didn't use to live like this. Did we? We all know this is not normal, but as it continues, it becomes the new normal. And I think it calls on all of us to do all within our power to use our bully pulpit, party aside. And we know there are folks that will listen to Senator Orock, there are folks that will listen to Senator Burns. I can run the list. We all have people that listen to us. We should absolutely come together and use the bully pulpit. To model behavior that is not divisive, not rancorous, not tearing down, but sounding the message of coming together to address the needs of our constituents and our state is what we need to be doing. And playing not at all into this scenario that well, we're just going to have to put more cops everywhere all the time. We're going to have to arm, have to state if not more, on and on and on. We've come in the wake of that, comes just more negativity and more potential for harm. So let's not let this violence, and we know that we have people in very high profile positions in the politics of this nation that behave that way and their behavior encourages others. Oh, he can do it. Well, I can do it too. I can get up and cuss out people in the school board meeting. They're even passing bills to say the parents can do that, you know, without much, without much of a blowback on them. So I just urge us all to think deeply about the role that we can, that we should, that we must play in promoting coming together to solve problems and make progress together and to stand in the face of and put a stop to these new dangerous norms that we see taken over our state and our country. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Senator from the A to the rise of an important personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. In light of, along the lines of what the Senator from, I can't remember what, in the district, 36, where we're at today and the world that we're living in, you know, I don't know if our politics have become a reflection of the people, of our people, or a reflection of the politics. But we talked about Elvis Presley, the late great Elvis Presley, earlier today, and had an opportunity to do that radio show with Lieutenant Governor, it was awesome, had the best time in the world. And there was a song, I didn't realize really that Lieutenant Governor was a bit of an Elvis fan himself. And in fact, when he, when he got married, the mother, the mother and son dance that they had was to the song called, if I can dream, by Elvis Presley. Now, you all know Elvis was born in abject, but he was born in the age of 18, and by Elvis Presley. Now, you all know Elvis was born in abject poverty. His mother would pit cotton when he was a little boy, when he was an infant, and would drag him on the burlap sack through the field by his slip. So he got to see abject poverty in the greatest riches in the world. And I think about what's going on today, we've heard the protesters outside, and where we're at in terms of, you know, the stability in the country. And I think about 1968, my dad had an on-the-state on-the-state. But I've always said that my generation's 1968 was 2020. But in 1968, Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis, Elvis's hometown. Robert Kennedy was assassinated. The Vietnam War protest were raging throughout the country. And Elvis was going to do a Christmas special. And it could have been the end of his career. He didn't know if it was going to be successful or not. And he wanted to do a song that spoke to the country. Of course, his manager and everyone else advising against that, he said, you know, you don't do message songs. You don't want to offend anybody. But he felt so strongly about it that he did it anyway. I hope as we get forward to the position, maybe we can't get the words of this song. But, you know, the lyrics go, there must be lights burning brighter somewhere. Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue. If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walked hand in hand, tell me why, oh why can't my dreams come true. There must be peace and understanding sometime. Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear. If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone, tell me why, oh why won't let sun appear. We're lost in a cloud with too much rain. We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain. But as long as a man has a strength to dream, he can redeem his soul and fly. Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question. Still, I'm sure that the answer, the answer's going to come somehow. Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle. And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk, while I can dream, please let my dream come true. I think those words were true in 1968 and they're true in 2024. And I think God for the opportunity to serve with all of you. And I hope that we do our part to try to return to the stability of our public discourse. And it's an honor to serve with all of y'all. And God bless Mr. President, I yield the will. Thank you, Senator. Senator from the 54th, wish Razzle and Point of Persil privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Back during the special session, I had the opportunity to come to the well and thank many of you for your prayers and outreach after the passing of my mother in the summer. And I sincerely meant that. But today I wanted to go to the well because I wanted to tell you about my mom, Dell Ruth Payne. She's an absolute amazing woman. In so many ways, we talk about the greatest generation. I love history because of my mother and a lot of my father's teachings. But we talk about the greatest generation, that generation that had the hope to overcome a depression and then turn around and chase that hope off the war and into the fields and the factories for the first time. But my mother was of the next generation. She was of the silent generation. We don't talk about much about the silent generation. But if you think about the silent generation, was the silent generation, because they were the obedient generation. They just went out and did the work. And so I just wanted to come to the well and say, I'll teach you a lesson of my mother.

And every time I leave the house when I was 16 or 17 years old, my mother would meet me at the door. And sometimes I was going to that party. I didn't want her to know about. But she'd always meet me at the front door, and she looked me in the eyes like she was looking to the depths of my soul when she says, son, you just remember who you are. And I think that that's a message for a state and a nation that we need to remember who we are as a people. And the rest, the great lesson of my mother's life and what will always live on in me and my brother, my sister, and her grandkids is my mother. I never in her life, not one time, did she ever come in the room and say, I want. My mother would always say, I hope. And I came to realize in life that hope is what I chased out the door of an airplane 46 times as an army paratrooper. I left want behind to chase my hope. Hope is why I walked the spit off my face after a 16 year old just spitting my face as a probation officer, juvenile probation officer, that I didn't allow myself to be angered because I didn't want. I couldn't let my want have control. My want said rip his head off his shoulders. But hope whispered in my ear, said, yeah, that just happened. But it really looked at him. And when you really started looking at him, you saw a 16 year old boy starts shrinking down to a three year old, just looking up at you and asking you, is there a place in this world for me? Hope that there's a legacy of my mother, is the way hope. And I tell people all the time, I said, there's only two places one exists, hail on earth. There's only two places hope exists since Christ, earth in heaven. So I might hope for us in this coming section and going forward that we will govern ourselves by what we hope for and never by what we want for. Because the same message I gave to teenagers for 30 years, your want will eventually you down a path, you can't crawl out, I down in a hole you can't crawl out of. But your hope will never, ever, ever leave you in that state. Thank you, Miss President, now we yield the win. Thank you Senator, and we are sorry for your loss, you've experienced this year. Recognize the Senator from the 16th for a point of personal privilege. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I just want to recognize freedom is not free. And the end of December the 29th, we had officer Mark McIntyre shot and killed in small town. Interest he was going to a domestic call, and he was shot and killed. I realize this freedom is not free. Somebody stands in the gap for you and me. And our law enforcement officers stand in that gap for us and we need to be very appreciative. The scripture says that greater love has no man that laid down his life for his friend. Can I give you this, our law enforcement officers laid out their life for those who are not their friend? That's even a greater love in my opinion. You'll have a wife, he left children. I think the thing we have to realize is that there's good and evil, and no matter how many laws we pass, evil is still present, and that our law enforcement officers are those that stand in the gap between good and evil for you and me. Friday was one of the first times I've been to a ceremony in which they honored a down an officer that was down. There were over 3,000 law enforcement and people there in honoring Mark McIntyre. The stories behind it were phenomenal, because he had an opportunity to go into other locations. But he said my calling is to be a law enforcement officer. I don't know about you, but that's a high calling in that respect. And he believed that God had called him to that position. I just want to recognize him and his ultimate sacrifice for us, and for all those men and women who serve in law enforcement and protect us and are willing to lay down their life. I don't know about you, but as we are here in some of the protests enough, I don't know about you, but these guys around us, the state patrol, those that are here, the Capitol Police, realizing this that they are there to stand for us in between us. And I just want to say thank you, and also to honor one who was willing to lay down his life in Sergeant Mark McIntyre. Thank you. Senator, do you mind if I ask for the chamber to stand in the moment of silence for both the deputy from Spolting County as well as one from Cal Edie County here recently? We've had two very, very unfortunate accidents in the last couple of weeks. So everybody, stand attention to the world. Hey, man. Thank you, Senator. Does any of the Senator wish we're eyes on a pointed personal privilege? Chair, here's none. When we're moving on, Secretary will read the message from the House of Representatives.

We'll just convene just like the majority leader said at 10am, on Thursday and around probably 11, we will make our way over to the House for our annual state of the state. You know, senator, I sat beside you for 10 years and I don't believe there's committee in this building, you shouldn't be home, you know. Are there any motions to withdraw or commit? Senator from the 32nd for what purpose do you rise? Thank you, Mr. Press.

Mr. President, on the last day of the 2023 session, you appointed a conference committee on House Bill 514. I was appointed to that committee along with the senators from the 45th and the senator from the 30th. I would note that the senator from the 30th resigned from the senate last week leaving a vacancy on this committee. I would ask that you fill that vacancy so the conference can continue their work. Secretary, we will read the caption on House Bill 514. House Bill 514 by representatives Washburn of the 144th and others.

All right. I think as much as I thought about this senator from the 26th were a little bit up here. The man behind you wanted it a lot worse than you did. So the senator from the 28th will fill that role. The motion that senator from the 21st asked for. We're going to keep that in mind, senator from the 26th onward.
