----------
Good morning. Good Monday morning, the hour convenient to have it arrived. All members, all members, if you'll come into the chamber, take your seats. All members. Mr. Clerk, do you mind ringing the bell? All members. All members will come into the chamber, please. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members vote in. Have all members voted themselves in? All members. All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock machines? Good morning. Doer keep us. Will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Members, if you will take your seats and give respect, some members from the Gnett delegation that will be joining together up front for your members and some condolences this morning. We're going to go a little bit out of order, but I want to recognize represented Jasper and Clark and represented Hilton. We're making some comments and the Gnett delegation. Members, if you'll all join me and let's stand. All members. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, Gnett County was rocked by unspeakable violence against law enforcement. Two officers, officer Pradeep Tameing and Corporal David Reed, were dispatched to a hotel in Gnett County for suspected fraudulent use of a credit card. Officers were directed to the room in which the card was used and were greeted by Kevin Andrews who invited them in and later shot at the officers. Unfortunately, this senseless act of gun violence claimed the life of 25-year-old officer Tameing while Corporal Reed remains hospitalized after suffering serious injuries. Officer Tameing has been a member of the Gnett County Police Department for less than a year joining in spring of 2025. And so I will now pass it to my colleague and fellow member of the Gnett delegation, Chairman Hilton. Thank you, Representative. Officer Tameing represented one of the best of us. He immigrated to the United States 10 years ago. And like my colleague said, just graduated in May of last year. He was only 25 years old and he gave everything he had, including his life, to the service of the people of Gnett County. Master Police Officer David Reed remains in the hospital this morning in critical but stable condition. He is also a veteran of the Gnett County Police Department having joined in September of 2015. He answered the call for over a decade and as we speak, he is fighting to recover from his wounds. Our prayers go out to him and his family. Mr. Speaker, this is the first time a Gnett County officer has been killed in the line of duty since officer Antoine Tony was shot and killed in 2018. And only the six in the department's history. Today I ask my colleagues in the chamber to please join me and recognize the ultimate sacrifice made by officer Pradeep Tameing. I ask us to keep master Police Officer David Reed and his families in our prayers as he works toward a full recovery. And I ask the people of Georgia and the people of this chamber to never forget what these officers and what law enforcement nationwide give us so that we may all live so freely. Thank you and God bless. Ms. Balsett, yeah. If you'd bow your heads with me in the moment of silence. Thank you colleagues. Thank you members. Doves is to the family. Prayers for the healing of the wounded officer. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. This morning I have the honor and privilege of introducing our chaplain. He's a gentleman that I've known for many years. Respect him greatly. From down in Effingham County, Georgia, Gaiton, Georgia down near Savannah for those who don't know where Effingham is. It's just north of Savannah. He's a friend. He's a leader in our community and does just that. He leads in our community where the church house or the state house. Thank you for your service there, Lawn. Lawn Harden has passed her at the Mesodonia Missionary Baptist Church in Gaiton for 12 years now. This is 156 years old so it has little history. They don't call her pastor what I have in it. Call her good one. I assure you this is a good one. He's married to a lady that I respect very much in Mesheela Harden. They've been married for 35 years. That's a testimony to her endurance. No doubt about that. They have three daughters and three grandsons. After 32 years of service with Singed River Flight support, and he does keep himself busy at the church in our community. He serves on our IDA board, and he serves on our planning and zoning chairman of the city of Gaiton. He also served eight years in the US Marine Corps. There you go, Chairman Hitchens. I knew that was coming so I may have no last for it, why? It's a great pleasure today. I'll go ahead and admit to you that Lawn is pinch-heating. He's always prepared. He knew about this about an hour ago. We appreciate him and life's about timing. The Lord had you here to fill this pool pit for the day. This diocese for the day. Come bring our devotion and we appreciate you doing this and appreciate you being here. I appreciate you for who you are. Thank you, Lord. Come on up. Thank you, Speaker Burns. And to all those under Son of my voice, good morning. I greet you in the name of our Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If you allow me just for a few moments to give a morning, I would say inspiration. It comes from Romans the eighth chapter and verse 38 and 39. And it reads as follows, for I am persuaded that either death no life, no angels or principalities, no things present or things to come, no height, no death, no any other creative thing, she'll be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This letter that Paul wrote to the church in Rome is encouraging them. And each and every one of you this morning in this chamber are persuaded. You're persuaded in one way or another while you are serving your community and you're serving this state that you're doing the right thing on behalf of the people. Paul here is emphasizing to us even a greater that even the good things and the bad things can take you off course. Here Paul, his name was not always Paul. His name was Saul and he was public enemy number one. His job was to go out and persecute those who were of the Christian faith. He would take a degree and he would take again, there would be warrants to go out and bring them in by any means necessary. But I'm an earth-winning fan, earth-winning and fire fan. And I always love to use the phrase, but something happened along the way. And there he was traveling down on a Damascus road with a group of individuals and God picked him out of the group of people. He knocked him off his beast and hit him with the light. And only he was the one that received what God sent to him. How many of you know that you may be picked out to be picked on? Think about that. You're called out of many other people to serve and do what you do here today. But not only that, but Paul also his sight was taken from him. God took his sight from him after he knocked him off this beast. And then he told him to go see a man by the name of Ananias. How is it that you took my sight but you want me to go somewhere? That's when you trust that I will walk by faith and not by sight. Sometimes there's things that we get into that we don't know the end of it. We don't know how it's going to turn out but I'm going to do it anyway because I'm commanded in commission to do so. So I encourage us today if you take away anything from this is that you are and we are persuaded in this day and in this time to do what is right. And as I remind you as I conclude this is that looking at this that you are persuaded in either death nor life that means things to present or things to come, the things that are unseen that means I trust and I faith is in God himself. So brothers and sisters and delegates and all those on this out of our voice continuously to do what is right do what God has you to do on behalf of the citizens and the people that you serve because it is important. And be not persuaded by anything that's not right. I encourage you to do the right thing. So search yourselves but know that you are persuaded. Nothing will be able to separate you from the love of God. Well how do you mean that? Well Paul here I'm going to give you a little interesting about him is that he was shipwreck. He was in prison many times. He even was bitten by a viper and that same hand that was bitten by the viper he used at the healer man. You're going to go through some things, be going to face some things, be going to take some bumps and bruises along the way. Everybody is not going to be on your side. Amen? If you're persuaded about your cause and about your purpose that won't bother you. You got bit by snake shake it off. You got in prison you come out you're going to be all right. That's what I'm talking about to persuade it of doing the right thing means that you'll go through many things to do the right thing. So in my conclusion again ask yourself are you persuaded in this season that we live in to do the right thing no matter what is taking place? Let us pray. Our Father in heaven we come now God in the humblest manner that we know how. We come thinking you for another day's journey and we are glad about it. Thank you for life health and strength and the air that we breathe. Thank you for watching over us all night long while we slumbered and slept. That no fire didn't break out and no robber didn't break in. But oh God will be lift up the Gwyneth delegation this morning. Oh God on behalf of those offices that lost their lives and the line of duty and that are fighting for his life. God will be known that you are a healer and you are protected and God will be asked to continuously heal and protect and comfort that family. And Lord look on us here today. Continue to keep the hair of your protection around us. Look after our country this world that we live in the leadership in Washington the leadership here in Atlanta. Oh God in in our Vanessa Palates all across the state of Georgia and we give you all the praise all the glory and all the honor that you really deserve. For it is in your name we pray amen. Let us now look to the flag for our pledge of allegiance. To the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation in the God. Indivisible with liberty just as for all. Thank you all very much and I appreciate the opportunity to serve. Or keepers you may unlock the doors. So sometimes you just know you know we'll fell on you know it's hard. I knew Lawn didn't need much notice for he could bring us a devotion today it would be meaningful. Thank you Reverend Harden and we appreciate you. Thank you. Members you may all greet Pastor Harden out in the south any room. I appreciate your thanks for him being here today. I'm just thinking you for bringing our doctor of the day today. Thank you, Dr. Osama Hashmi. We appreciate him being here.

The Link's Incorporated is a fantastic organization that I'm honored to be a member of, comprised of over 17,000 women around the world, dedicated to community service, and uplift. There are 299 chapters. Someone gave a number for community service earlier, I'll present to another one, and it is 1 million, because the Link's Incorporated submit 1 million documented service hours each end every day. My sisters are not sitting in the gallery this morning because they're in the sloppy, fluid building in panels, and presenting their legislative agenda, and checking in on things that impact our community. So it is my honor and my privilege as a member of this organization to ask you to acknowledge Link's Day at the Capitol, and when you see the gorgeous women in green and white walking through, please speak with them. They are your doctors and physicians in your communities. They are your principals. They are your HBCU presidents.

So happy Link's Day, my sisters, and if you would, colleagues, just acknowledge Link's Day at the Capitol. Thank you. Yes, representing Dorin Carter is recognized for two minutes to speak to us about Black History Month. Good morning, and thank you. Give the lady the will, your attention, please. Well, I'm excited to stand before you this morning because we are celebrating the centennial of recognizing Black History in the U.S. So today, my moment in Black History, I rise to honor Lucy Kraft-Laney, one of Georgia's most influential educators and a true architect of opportunity. Born and making in 1854, nearly a decade before the end of slavery. Lucy Kraft-Laney learned to read at a time when educating Black children was illegal. Her parents understood that education was the pathway to freedom, and Lucy carried that belief for the rest of her life. She became part of the first graduating class of Atlanta University and went on to dedicate herself to teaching across Georgia. In 1883, she founded the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, beginning with just six students in a church basement. Under her leadership, the school grew to educate hundreds of Black students and prepare them for college across the nation. Lucy Kraft-Laney believed education should develop both the mind and character. She established a first kindergarten for African-American children in Augusta and helped create early nurse and training programs for Black women open indoors to help and long been close. Her legacy reminds us that education is not just instruction. It is empowerment, dignity, and hope. It is fitting that her portrait hangs just outside this door in the capital. A permanent reminder that Georgia's history is shaped by those who dare to teach, lead, and lift others. I am honored to honor and recognize Lucy Kraft-Laney today for...

a moment in black history. Thank you, and I yield the will. Thank you, Representative Carter. Remember as I hope you'll join with me and recognize a former member of this house and a good friend to many of us in here who now serves Cobb County on the G dot boarded and we appreciate your service there of former member Doug Stoner. Let's make Doug welcome. That completes our morning orders. We'll move on to the rules calendar. We have three bills on the rules calendar this morning. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 557? House Bill 557 by Representative Hawkins, 27th and others to be tallied back to amend Code Section 1562. Well, the official go to Georgia annotated relating to the number of judges and superior courts. So as a provide for a six judge of the spirit courts of the Northeastern judicial circuit, Ms. Bill that may refer to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Lee Hawkins is recognized to present House Bill 557. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you will notice with the LC number this is a substitute. And the reason for that is I dropped this bill last year. Our judges decided to wait until this year to let another circuit go through. So the substitute is a date change from 26 to 27 on lines 25 and 109. This bill simply adds a six judge to the Northeastern circuit. I'll stand for any questions. I have no questions. Thank you, sir. I have your support. And I was yielded the will and asked for your support. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here he none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Here he none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We will vote yes. All those opposed. We will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 557 that yeas 169, the nasa zero, the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 960? House Bill 960, our representative Clark, and themekound other ask implement code section 5 6 6 2 the یہ Fitch hello, the court asks replacement for one for her twelfth judge, with the superior courts at the quanditisnd CarCola turtle. little anchburty. Jamie Consticle, apps, microcontinues for the annals. If Jasmine Clark is recognized to present House Bill 960, and ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today, I rise to ask for your favoral consideration for House Bill 960, which is LC473480. This is a simple bill that would add a 12 judge to the Superior Court in the Gwyneth Judicial Circuit. Currently, the Gwyneth Judicial Circuit has almost 100,000 residents per Superior Court judge. Which is almost twice the state average of 50,000 residents per judge. These judges are seeing just under 1900 cases per judge, which is also well over the state average of just under 1500. Based on this reality, Judicial Council has stated a demonstrated need of 14.6 Superior Court judges for the Gwyneth Judicial Circuit. This bill seeks to add one more judge to get us closer to meeting that need. This judgeship is a third on the list from Judicial Council for Workload Value. And additionally, while bills for additional judgeships to the Superior Court are general bills, this bill has bipartisan support of an overwhelming majority of the Gwyneth delegation meeting the Gwyneth threshold of support for local legislation. We also have the support of the Gwyneth County Commission Chair. And with that, again, I ask for your favorable consideration for House Bill 960. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield for questions. Lady has a couple of questions. Representative Drenner, to your left, is recognized for a question. Representative Drenner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? Yes, I yield. Isn't it true? The lady will suspend on her question just for a moment. proceed, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Isn't it true that you are a member of the PhD caucus? Yes, that is true. Isn't it further true that this is your first bill and that we are all so happy for you. Congratulations. Thank you. Yes, that is true. And she has a consensus as well, too. That's pretty cool. Minority leader of this House, Representative Higley, is recognized. Leader Higley is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? Yes, I yield. So, do y'all have all these bad people in Gwyneth that you need more judges? Is that what you're saying to us? So, the superior court handles a lot of different types of cases, not just criminal cases. And so, what I would say is that a Gwyneth is a great place to live. And that the concern is just that we want to make sure that our judges are able to handle their workload. Lady has another question or two, was she yield? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Now, I want to assure you, if I don't know that question, you wouldn't have had to answer that question. It's nothing better. Thank you, Minor Leader. Representative Reeves, to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the chair-leddy yield. Yes, to my friend. Is it not true that this bill is supported by the statistics from the Judicial Council for this County of over a million people? It is bipartisan. And the day this went through the Judiciary Committee, there were about 500 Gwyneth residents on jury duty about the tri-jury trials that day. Absolutely, yes. The need is very great, and Judicial Council has recognized that as such. Yes, this is a very important bill for Gwyneth County. Lady has one more to your left and back. Representative Stenson is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? Yes. Madam, Representative, can you tell me how House Bill 960 actually will impact the funeral home industry? Yes. How will this bill impact the funeral home industry? Well, I think any time we're dealing with cases that involve death, then they will eventually make their way to the funeral homes. And so therefore, this is a very important bill for the funeral home caucus. So would this bill help judges be able to sign off on death certificates and on timely manners so the funeral home can take care of fairs on behalf of the families across the state of Georgia? Absolutely, especially in the Gwyneth Judicial Circuit. All right. Well, thank you. Lady has no further questions. I promise you I'll do a better job of screening your questions next time. Lady has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you all the well? The job, the lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here, none of the previous questions are ordered. Is there any objection to a green to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here, none the report of the committee's agreed to shall. This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Mr. Clerk, will you just kid? All members voted. All members voted. All members voted. All members have voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of the bill 960, the yeas of 169, the nays are won. The bill hasn't received the requisite cost of its majority. Is therefore passed. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Representative Clerk, would you mind coming up and letting me have a photo with you as well? Thank you. Yes. Congratulations. Members, we'll move on. We have another bill on the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 659? House Bill 659, by the represent of Green and the 154th and others of the Italian Act to amend Chapter 34, Title 31. The bill is going to draw to annotated relating to medical professionals for rural assistance. So, it's the Expand Medical Education Funding and the Service Cancelsal Loan Program. This bill haven't further the committee on rural development. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Green has recognized to present House Bill 659, Chairman Green, the dean of this house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, House Bill 659 addresses critical workforce and access to care needs related to optometry in our state. The bill expands eligibility for loan repayment and financial assistance programs to include optometries, placed in them alongside other health care professionals who serve Georgia communities and often carry significant educational debt. This bill originated out of the Rural Development Committee. This bill originated out of the Rural Development Committee and we found that not only the problems that we were having with other health officials, that it was a large number of optometries not serving rural areas. Right now in the state of Georgia, we train our people not in Georgia but in Birmingham, Alabama and in Memphis, Tennessee. We hope and trust that this is the beginning of a process for an optometry school in the state of Georgia. Georgia is one of the most popular states of the nation without an in-state optometry school forcing students to leave the state for their education. I hope and trust that you will vote with me on House Bill 659 on 659 which increase access to vision and I care services statewide. And we'll strengthen the health care workforce especially in rural Georgia. Ms. Baker, there's no questions. I yield the well. Gentlemen, has no questions. Good job. Mr. Chairman, I think if you can't see, you can't learn to read, can you? Let's work on that out of school about optometry. Thank you for the bill. Is there any objection to previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the bill will vote? Yes, all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Yes, I will. All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the pass of House Bill 659 the yeas are 168 and nays are two. This bill having a seat of the cost of majority is therefore passed. We're going to move on to afternoon orders today. I'm going to ask members, I want to recognize two members that are going to express and condolences to begin our afternoon orders. Members, I'm going to ask you to hold it to one minute. If there is any way possible, one minute. And we'll recognize Chairman Dickie for an afternoon order. I'll ask you members to stand and remain standing for the next afternoon orders. Well, Chairman Dickie. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'll ask the members of the Make and Be of delegation to come down. We had a former member who served in this party. Chairman, suspend just for a moment. Okay. Make and be of delegation if you'll come down. I'd like to, Mr. Speaker, if I could recognize John F. Stewart, a former member of this body. John served in this body an awful long time ago. He would have turned 100 next month. And he came in in 1965. 64 and 65. There was a special reapportionment to give you a little history. The county unit system was declared unconstitutional in 1962. And in 1963 and four, they had a special reapportionment election with a lot of new members came in. 11 African Americans came in in that special election. Call of Sanders was governor. George T. Smith was Speaker of this house. And other members you might recognize that served with John was Tommy Irvin, Joe Frank Harris, Julian Bond, Tom Murphy, George Busby, Marcus Collins, and others in this body as well as Jimmy Carter, Bobby Rohan, and Cover Kid across the way over in the Senate. But John did not serve at one term. He got reapportionment out. It was a multi-districted, district in Macon. But he loved this house. He always asked me questions. He was very critical. He was not very sometimes encouraging to me. He was one of nine Republicans at the time in this house. But he loved this house. He kept a close eye on it. And he survived. He lost his wife just three years ago, but survived by a great friend of mine. And Steve Stewart and his younger son, my brother-in-law, Cliff Stewart. So just a moment of silence for John F. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Long life, all my member, life we all lived. Remain standing, represent, train. Represent, long trains recognized for a remembrance. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House District 80 has two officers who have fallen within the past six months. In Chambley, Georgia, officer, lock, tram, who served in Chambley, Georgia. No relation to me for 15 years. He had some health complications and passed away. And then in my city of Dunwoody, I can't believe I forgot his name. One second. Oh, detective Jordan Loverty of Dunwoody, Georgia. He served in the Cap County for three years and eight years with the Dunwoody Police Department. So, take a moment of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Thanks for their service. But you may be seated. Represent Bernal. Recognize for an afternoon order. Give the lady in the well your attention.

Dr. Smith, thank you for your service to our community and to the school district. You will be missed. And at this time, I'm going to let Representative Bel, Dr. Smith, Representative Bel's principal. I would like to say on behalf of the graduating class of Madeys Mill High School 2009 and all the other classes that Dr. Smith had a hand to touch, that we are honored to be your student, that we are honored to stand on the backs of giants and honor to go down the path as you pay for us. So, thank you, Dr. Smith. I know in the future, your life has so much more of head of you and I hope we're making you proud. Mr. Speaker, we yield to you. Thank you, Representative. Congratulations, Dr. Smith, great career representative Bel. We'll recognize you again while you're up here to speak to us again. Gentlemen, recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I'll rise because today we're reclaiming a moment to remember the past, to claim the beauty and the brilliance placed within us by our creator. For me, braiding my hair is not just the style, but it's about history. It's about legacy. Braised trace back thousands of years across Africa where every pattern spoke about an identity of a community or belonging. In times of bondage, our ancestors braided seeds into their hair so they can have amongst the travel that they can sow seeds of life. The braids were messages and maps of freedoms, even in oppression. They found a way to plant hope. So when I braided my hair today, I'm not just here to, I'm not, it's not just about grooming. It's to honor the sacred past that we inherited. It's about wearing the prayers. It's about the strength and the survival of my people. And yet too many, too many children amongst us don't have the same pleasure and dignity in self-sommerty. With that, I would like to bring awareness to the Crown Act and thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Thank you, Representative. Representative Butler. Recognize for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've been asked to share with you this National Newsletter that Tom Rollins wrote. And so I'm just going to read it as verbatim. First up is the situation in my home state of Georgia where the child welfare agency is on track for a $48 million shortfall and has this October stop funding private agencies who do the necessary work of providing behavioral aids, family assessments, and transportation. The agency has treated this situation as a nothing burger, blaming juvenile court judges who ordered unnecessary services and providers who aren't doing their jobs. I said in a letter that was delivered to the governor last week a child welfare agency that cuts off its private providers and drives some of them to close their doors is cutting off its nose to spite its face. While the legislature appears poised to reinstate and increase the funding, thankfully the agency's attitude towards the providers is quite frankly horrendous. In a Republican-led state that's always invited public and private partnerships, this commissioner suggests that they should be handling these services in-house. If you found a child care system that can accomplish this mission purely relying on government services, please let me know. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair, ladies and gentlemen, I represent the Lynn Smith recognized for an afternoon order. So it's still good morning. Good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for your unanimous vote last week on the state regional water plans, but also to inform you that if any of you have any questions about it, I have some contact information at my desk. There were a few errors of aligning the representative up with the district, so we want to make sure that those questions get answered. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the well. Thank you, Representative Ali. Give the gentleman the well. You're a tangent, please. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity and members of this House. I direct your attention to the screen to see David. David is 15 years old, a future personal trainer, determined, hardworking, and immensely creative. Oftentimes, it's harder for teenagers to get adopted and get out of the system. And I ask that we create a world where that is not the normal, where we break that, we'll re-break that mold, and we advocate for change at it's my turn now dot dhs.gov. Thank you so much. Thank you, Representative. Looking young man, not you, Representative Ali David, so I was talking about. Representative Hagen and Camp. There is Representative Hagen, Representative Camp. Representative Camp, you want to join us down front? Here, Lady Camp. I'm going to talk about NCSL. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and colleagues. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing us to talk for a moment. NCSL is going to be here this week. Every single member in this room is a member of NCSL. You are all members. They are a great resource for data, for research. They will research things for you. Their meetings are wonderful to go to because you get a chance to hear what other states are doing and learn from other colleagues and make connections. And I'm going to turn this now over to Chair Hagen to follow up. Thank you, Chair Camp. I just want to let all of you know if you haven't seen in your House email account, there is an email from NCSL inviting you to click on a link where you can sign up to meet with them this week while they are here visiting. Please take advantage of that if you would like to meet with them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, ladies. I know many of you are involved with NCSL. It's a good opportunity to visit with them and learn what the opportunities are. We are members of NCSL and it's a commitment that we make so that opportunity and that information and those resources are available to us all. So I encourage all of you to take advantage of them this week but certainly in the future as you engage with folks from around the country. Represented Ballard, Blackmond, Dickey and Crow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank all of you for joining us today to recognize the courageous service of Warner Robbins Police Officer Matthew Whiteel. Last Thursday, Officer Whiteel was shot several times while responding to domestic disturbance, putting himself in harm's way to protect our community.

We are profoundly grateful that he survived his injuries and is now recovering in the hospital. Our law enforcement officers including officer White Hill routinely run toward danger, safeguarding our citizens during their most difficult moments. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to him and to all who serve in law enforcement. Thank you. Thank you and prayers and great thoughts for his recovery. Our representative Representative Griffin. General's recognized for an afternoon order. The gentleman from Millageville, Georgia, Representative Griffin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker and members of this house. I rise today to recognize Black History Month. A time not only to reflect on the past, but to draw the lessons that continue to guide our work. Black History Month is often described as a story of struggle, but it is also a story of service, strength and steadily leadership. Throughout history, Black men and women served their communities in this nation. Often we'll find recognition because service was necessary. They served in churches, schools, neighborhoods and in uniform, carrying the responsibility greater than their authority. My years in uniform taught me that leadership is measured not by rank, but by responsibility to the people you serve. Black History also teach us about strength, quiet strength rooted in faith, disciplines and character. Strength that endured hardship and helped communities together during unseered times. And perhaps most importantly, Black History teach us to value a steady leadership. Because it did not come overnight, it came because people showed up consistently, did the work and state focus on moving forward. History reminds us that leadership is not defined by Taiwan, but by responsibility. It is also solved by problems and others remain steady when challenged. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. I've got a couple of extra minutes, right? Thank you. You did, but you put on the good use, Representative, I appreciate you. That concludes our afternoon orders.
