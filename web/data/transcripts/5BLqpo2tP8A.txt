TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
I believe with a subcommittee, so I'm going to go ahead because he presented a great
bill last summer.
I want to make sure we take advantage of this time.
We won a rules committee meeting, and Senator Dolezal got me here on time, so you have
him credit for that.
But why don't you go and sort of give us a brief refreshment of what you've talked about
earlier, and let's see if we can get some action on it, okay, yes.
My name is Scott Holcomb, and I'm presenting to you House Bill 364.
House Bill 364 has been an effort that this General Assembly has worked on for many years.
And I think there's long been a recognition that we would benefit by improving the process
by which we compensate the wrongly convicted.
As you all are aware now and as the resolutions that follow will be presented, right now it
requires an individual resolution.
So every person who is wrongfully convicted has to have a resolution filed and go through
the whole gauntlet of the legislative process.
Many members have shared with me and candidly I'm a practicing lawyer and a former prosecutor
that they feel a little bit uncomfortable making these decisions, is that they require an
expertise in understanding if the person was in fact innocent and reviewing the legal
case history to come up with a good decision.
So what this bill does in a very high level overview is it would create a panel of experts
which would include a judge, a district attorney,
a defense lawyer, and then two appointments,
one from the House and one from the Senate,
and those appointments would have to have specific expertise
in wrongful convictions and particularly with DNA evidence.
My understanding was almost everybody
who has been exonerated, meaning that they did not commit
the crimes that they were prosecuted for and jailed for
had been released because of DNA evidence.
We've had great advances in DNA evidence and technology
and testing over the last couple of decades.
So this group would then evaluate,
ensure that the person is innocent.
We've worked with the prosecutors
to make sure that the language is tight
and would only apply to those that are innocent,
not to those that may have then released
on a technicality.
And then if they found the person was innocent,
then they could recommend compensation.
So we already do this as a general assembly,
so we'd be deling getting this to experts.
And the range would be between 50 and 100,000.
That range was determined based on studying
how this is done across the country.
38 states have wrongful compensation panels,
and the median dollar amount is 75,000.
Most states set a specific sum,
whereas we are putting in place a range,
and then the panel could take into account different factors
in terms of making recommendation within that range,
between 1,500 and 1.2 know is that in serving
the other states, there are some states
that are much, much more generous.
Some states provide $200,000 per year of incarceration
as well as even medical benefits afterwards.
So what George is doing is certainly significant
and I support our measure but compared relatively speaking
is we would be kind of right in the middle,
but we would also advance, I think this process,
if this were to move forward, by being a state
that has a commission of experts
to help the General Assembly with this decision.
So then finally, if there was a recommendation,
it would go to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The idea there is that since the mistake took place
in the court system, it makes sense for it
to be within their budget.
Also because of separation of powers,
my understanding is that the governor
when making his recommendation to the General Assembly
usually does not change in any way
the recommendations that come from the judiciary.
So the General Assembly would then have it
and would have final oversight for any recommendation.
Then the last sort of substantive part in the bill
to highlight is this also has a protective feature
for the state whereby if an individual had a claim
for wrongful conviction.
There is under civil law claim for wrongful conviction,
the state would get a credit for that.
In other words, if somebody participated
through this process, they could not both get a dollar amount
from this and then also receive a dollar amount unaffected
in that claim.
There would be a credit and an offset
because those dollars are coming from the state.
So I'd be happy to answer any questions.
And the other thing Mr. Chairman did just point out
is we did have a discussion earlier this week
that when we met about the annuity issue,
as written now, the bill has recommendation
that the funds are provided in cash.
The primary reason for that is that these individuals,
the vast majority of people that we've compensated
have spent 15, 20, 25 years in prison,
so they don't have assets, they don't have property,
they don't have retirement, they don't have Medicare,
they don't have Social Security,
so experts in this space strongly recommended cash
because the needs are very great for those
that have been harmed this way,
but there was a recommendation to have an annuity
if the award were above 1.5 million.
So I had an amendment put together
if the committee was interested in pursuing that.
I actually think it's a really good idea,
and I would support it if that were.
You have it on the will of the committee.
Yes, sir.
I handed it in early.
You have to have a amendment out.
Remember, you have the amendment.
They don't have it, okay.
You know, can we get a copy made of that so we can look at that and if what we do, I went
on line and looked at just a few of the exoneration across the country and it's really, really
varied, but you got about 1,000 a year in the United States of America.
I looked at Texas, they all for 88 million dollars, 88,000 dollars a month.
and then it goes paying taxes as well.
So where you aren't feeling on the taxes,
you should not be a mount,
but are you sort of feeling
about that as well?
There should not be tax,
because this is a,
it's not income,
and we have a reference to that in the bill.
It may take me a second to find it,
but this money should be exempt from taxation.
Okay, all right.
Because that happened to one of our persons
who had been exonerated and he was hit pretty much.
So what I will do right now is,
do you have a, do you each member have a copy
of the amendment, you don't?
Okay, pass it on, okay, thank you.
Will you take a look at the amendment
And let's see if this is something that we can look at.
And I don't think it's at a trouble with the amendment
on this particular bill.
And I also noticed that of all those, what I said about just
under 1,000 in the United States, the least of the medium
is like $3.6 million compensation
for any length of time that doesn't deal with that.
But I just thought that was sort of interesting.
But, and we were listed as not having payments
for long-for conviction in the group of people.
I don't know why that was like that.
But, so this would be our first recognized,
but we've been doing this for like 20 years,
I believe at least 20 years or more,
because I handle a John White case back in the 90s.
So I know we've been doing it for a while,
it's just maybe perhaps not recognized in some of the areas.
Mr. Chairman, we have been doing it,
but it's been an ad hoc individual basis.
I understand.
Yes, sir.
Have members of the committee had the chance
to look at the amendment?
And if you do, do I have a motion on that particular
commission amendment?
Do I hear a second?
Moved in proper, a second is all in favor, say aye.
post-like sign, now on the bill itself in the comments,
since the dollar's on.
Do you?
Yeah, I was just going to ask a question
of representative Holcomb.
Can you walk us through the $5,000 to $100,000 range,
how that compares to maybe the last five years of compensation
or some recent windows?
Do we typically fall within that window currently?
We do, sir.
Yes.
I think last years were maybe 60 to 65.
I'm not sure what the ones are this year,
but I think they're probably within that same range.
And so that has been generally where Georgia has been.
And then as mentioned, it would be pretty close
to the national mean, would be $75,000.
And what I mentioned in the earlier hearing was,
the idea behind it, I think that this would be,
if this were set up, how the board would apply it,
would be if you had somebody who maybe had a non-existent
war history for lack of a better term was kind of like a slacker,
they would probably be on the 50,000 range,
and then if God forbid, somebody like me,
more on the higher earning stage,
were wrongfully convicted,
I might be closer to the top end of it.
And so it would give them an ability
to consider the factors of work history, et cetera,
and making the recommendation for the number.
But to your point is yes,
we are within this range now,
so we're not dramatically changing
what we're doing through our ad hoc process.
This is more so a comment for us to move through the process.
I mean, this to me is probably one of the most difficult situations to deal with.
It's always unconscionable to imagine what it is like to be locked up and not having committed the crime.
I would probably honestly discourage us from considering work history in terms of the value of that.
First of all, second of all, I would consider length of time.
And perhaps that is more of a consideration than what lost earnings may have been.
been, because we very likely at this thinking of the scenario of a 20-year-old, we've taken
away their ability to prove what their earnings could have been.
That's true.
I would rather see that in consideration than work history personally.
You know the comments?
Just a question.
Senator Robertson.
Representative, I hope you found them.
Thank you for bringing this forward as we talked about last time.
I know this has been important to you and important to Chairman Efestration.
And on our side, Senator Strickland and myself, is it your understanding or is it your feeling
that if we have a structure in place beyond what we're having now that the turnouts we have
would be much closer to what they should be as opposed to the system we have now where
it goes to the Secretary of State's office, there's a committee there that's given information
by whatever group and then that particular decision
is made there, you think this has a little more integrity
to the system, if you will?
I think it improves it with Robertson, and by that,
I think that it will prevent any potential mistake
of us getting it wrong by having people that have real expertise
to make this review instead of us as legislatures.
Like it's, when I was asked to handle,
I've shared this before, when I was asked to carry
the resolution last year, my immediate reaction was no.
And then I had a bias of anybody that's in prison,
I think committed it because I'm a former prosecutor
and I had to kind of work through that.
And it's not an easy process to really understand.
really understand. And so that's part of what we're trying to do is to make sure that we get it
right and I think that this helps us achieve that. The other part is these individuals to Senator
Dolezal's point of having your liberty taken away for 10, 15, 20 years, not being able to be with
your loved ones for that period of time, not being able to invest in yourself in that time,
make money. All of those type of things of I don't want it to be subject to some
of the politics that sometimes happens here. Sometimes the House and the
Senate fight sometimes individual legislatures get sideways with other
legislatures and something could get killed just out of personalities and
politics. I don't know that that's ever happened but I don't want it to
happen either and so that's also part of what is driving this is what we could
just have for lack of a better term a more sterile system that just really
focuses on the facts the law and makes a recommendation in terms of what is an
appropriate remedy in terms of compensation and we still have oversight
through the organic appropriations role that the General Assembly plays if we
wanted to change the recommendation the recommendation is not absolute to us
but I think this puts really good guardrails in place to make sure that we make
the right call. Right and I'm not aware of the Senate and House ever disagree with each
other so that's foreign to me. Especially this time of year. Especially this time of
year. But who makes these decisions now? What is the what is the expertise of the committee
that makes these recommendations now? It's us. No no I'm talking about these these
resolutions that came to us they were vetted and someone said the other day that one of
was unanimous. So the way that it works now, you're correct in terms of there is a process
now and that process is that they come through the claims advisory board but the claims advisory
board is not filled with experts on wrong folk conviction. Is there a prosecutor on the claims
advisory board? I don't believe so. I'll say heads not in the back but I mean or shaken.
But so it's usually department heads. Yeah, so it's it's no one that's been involved as a prosecutor or within the criminal justice system
Somebody that may not understand the evidence of a system somebody that may not understand the power of a
Havius or or whatever that may may flow through the system. It's and is it
Who presents to this commission?
The claimant, and then the claimant usually has provono council that represents that.
So the individual seeking compensation and their council present.
And the legislator who's carrying the bill.
Right.
So there is no one presenting from the other side.
Let's say victims of this situation, victims, families or anything like that.
This is to be frank, I guess, a very one-sided presentation.
The ones that I've seen, yes, and I think that's because they were exonerating there wasn't
a victim by these individuals, but I don't know if the current process forecloses that
from happening.
That's a question I'm not sure of the answer, but as I mentioned to you last time, this
does have an invitation to the prosecutor in the district attorney or the attorney general
district attorney so if that person wanted to participate and object to the
request for compensation they would be unnoticed and would be able to do so
which I think is another good safeguard. That's current right now that you that
the person who was harmed or allegedly harmed by that alleged person perpetrated
they can appeal bringing to the attorney they could object. They could object.
Right now right so you know that that the very line of the question in
in comment and that, that's the very reason I think we need the kind of commission that
would sit in judgment and look at it because otherwise, just as he said, you're gonna have
those feelings going back and forth and people speculating and have another jury kind of
setting again, I suppose, so I would suppose that's why we want to move towards the kind
of unbiased, whatever that is, unbiased commission. But anyway, any more comments about it, some
That was all.
Mr. Chair, would you like to ask the committee what they think about the current range,
and even if Mr. Representative Holcomb could highlight for us again, I think you said
the average was $75,000 a year nationwide.
Across the country, yes sir.
And you said the high end was in the 200-200.
With medical care.
consideration given to the medical care piece in this. I'm ultimately just to be transparent
that the $50,000 number to me assuming that we do reach the point where there is exoneration
is pruned. The $50,000 number to me it seems really not as long to put too many adjectives
on this but I'm just wondering if it shouldn't be higher and if we shouldn't have our floor
be the average with the with the ceiling it's a little bit higher than we currently have.
Senator Dullesaw, I would support you in that 100%.
We tried to make as flexible as possible
to build the political consensus to pass,
but I see this very similarly of just the devastation
that it imposes on somebody to lose that much time
and not to be able to invest in themselves,
their career, et cetera, it's real.
The harm is real.
And in some states, Mr. Chair, for your mind,
in some states they had education incentives,
such as scholarships and things this nature,
to attempt to help the individual transition back into,
as normal as society is today,
but normal society, is that right?
Yes, sir.
Everyone has a cash, cash is the baseline,
and then the question is, where along the spectrum
do you land in terms of the cash payment?
And then it's a very, very small,
minority of states that have health care
or other type of services to help them get started.
Does any state cap legal fees?
I don't know that off hand, I'm not sure if any of the other experts know.
My general understanding is that legal fees are included because of the sense that if you're
wrongfully charged, as a practical matter, most of these people are going to have public
defenders, so there's not going to be legal fees, but let's just say, and this was a
scenario used in the house when we discussed this was let's just say that there
was prosecutorial misconduct it's rare but it does happen you know you didn't
do it you have resources you invest your resources but you don't get a fair
trial because there's prosecutorial misconduct the sense was that that should
be compensable because you had you wouldn't have had that outlay of
monies but for the bad conduct so that's why we left it in but practically
speaking, I don't think that there will be a lot in attorney's fees, just because most
of these individuals are going to be getting, as I mentioned, public counsel.
Thank you.
And I've looked at several of these, including Senator Dozal's home state, which I won't
mention.
I don't want to embarrass him.
And say.
And say Illinois out loud, but also looked in Florida and other places.
And so I do see where some, like you're talking about, have capped a few expenses and things
of that nature.
I appreciate it, Mr. Chair, when the time is right.
Yes, sir.
Your time is right now.
Plays of the committee.
Mr. Chair, I would move that we pass LC480912S is in Sierra.
As amended.
As amended, yes, sir.
Yeah, here, a second moment.
Can I make a further motion to amend?
Yes, sir.
I will make a motion to amend online 147
by striking $100,000 in increasing replacing it
with $120,000 and striking $50,000
and inserting it as placed $60,000.
Can we read it back for the record, Senator Dole?
Give me the line again.
Line 147 would then read may include $120,000 per year,
but shall include no less than $60,000 per year.
Moved it properly, seconded it, all in favor, sigh.
Now, we have passed the bill as amended by itself, you know, as amended.
All in favor say aye.
Opposed?
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Opposed say aye.
Aye.

Aye.
Aye.
House resolution from 48.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, would it be proper time for motion?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Let me, you want to make the motion before she presents.
I believe it's a mover if I make the motion.
Please do the committee.
My motion, Mr. Chair, having read through all of the resolutions, reached out to the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation on one of the cases reached out to other law enforcement
resources on the other cases.
One of the case out of my district, I had already received information from the prosecutor
in that county.
I think we now understand that the system is not set up to deal with these properly.
So my motion would be to table the three resolutions until the committee has proper time to get
the resources and read through the resolutions along with evidence and statements from the
law enforcement agencies in particular to understand these cases because as we mentioned
in the last committee meeting there is a discrepancy on what the definition of exoneration
are, and so I think for us to make an educated decision
on these resolutions, we must be educated on these three cases.
So my motion is that we table the four resolutions.
Any on readiness on that particular motion?
I'm sorry.
Senator, see?
Why do you have a second?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
It's my ears more than your ears.
And this is my second time in this committee on these, and I think we are intelligent enough
to have heard everything so far, and what we're, I disagree, yeah, okay, but let me
say this, before we accept it, and number one of this, that's four.
That's right.
You said three.
I start out for you.
Okay.
There are four resolutions for compensation.
Let us get a brief comment from everybody.
At that time, we'll vote it all at once with the will of the committee, I'll accept
you a motion then.
Can we have a brief date on four, 48?
I'm sorry.
You would give us an update on 48, Miss Advent.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
House resolution 48 and 49 are related, as in the last committee I mentioned, Mr.
Stinch, call me Mr. Wolflok or co-defendants who were acting in self-defense.
They ended up in a trial convicted for a crime.
They did not commit their statements of self-defense were consistent throughout, supported
by physical evidence.
There was an eyewitness who changed their testimony multiple times.
That seemed to be the basis of the prosecutor moving forward the first time.
There was a witness found who was thought to be dead, who cooperated, the self-defense
theory.
Prosecutor would not have a new trial.
And to Senator Robertson's point, I understand the concern about how these situations
are vetted.
And I also want to make clear to the committee that the compensation advisory committee, they
They don't decide, yes or no, the exoneration was right or wrong.
They accept that the court, or a prosecutor that a court has decided there should be a
new trial in the example of my resolution individuals, then the prosecutor did not move forward
and did an all-prosmining, there was no case.
They don't go behind that decision because they recognize that courts and legal professionals
are involved in them.
they are deciding solely is whether the agency that is attacked for lack of a better word
by the resolution, usually that's GBI or law enforcement or Department of Corrections,
they make a determination that the exoneration where the wrongful conviction had nothing
to do with Department of Corrections, for example, that's what happened in my situation.
And we wouldn't contend that they did, but they were rightfully exonerated.
And so the advisory committee, while they're not made up of experts, and it's not a yes
that evidence said this or no, it didn't, they are saying, they accept the exoneration
and they are trying to decide whether the Department of Corrections, for example, is responsible.
Representative David, would you go back one more, who, regarding the exoneration decision,
how does that come about, just in a nutshell, if you will.
So in the situation for Mr. Sinchkolma, Mr. Woolfolk, they had this new witness come
forward and the defense attorney asked to present that new evidence.
The prosecution said, no, we won't agree to a new trial for you to present this.
So they had to move for a new trial, which ultimately made it up to the Georgia Supreme
Court.
And the court's accepted it.
And the Georgia Supreme Court said, yes, you should have a new trial.
And then when it came time to have the new trial, the prosecutor in Fulton County said,
I have no case.
So that's the exoneration.
Okay.
just to be just to be clear when we talk about exoneration if Fulton County had
chosen to they could have retried this case correct this okay I mean I guess
logistically sure properly under the law no and that's why they didn't
because they didn't have evidence well they they had the evidence that the
bullet holes in the roof of the car and the the victim female sex worker was
was shot in the head through the roof of the car.
Ballistic showed that, which I think,
and if you look at self-defense,
when the individual disengages from the scene,
then the argument of self-defense stops.
I think what the court was looking at
was the denial of the court where the appeal was made
to setting up a hearing.
And the George Spring Court said that the lower court aired
and not allowing the hearing for the evidence,
but that if we're looking at physical evidence,
the lady got into an argument
with the individuals in the apartment, she was slapped,
she left, she went down to her car,
said she was gonna get her stuff
stated by one of the co-defendants.
She went into the car, got a revolver out.
There's conflicting statements between the two co-defendants as to how many shots she fired
along with, I think, Mr. Harris may be in or a witness there.
And then the other two individuals went and got their guns and started firing back.
And then, of course, Mr. Walfolk, I think, said his gun jammed, and that was proven to
be false based on testimony of others.
based on shell casings found on the ground outside of the apartment and so and I
understand age and I know you're the professional but age does change the
judicial process because evidence fades witnesses memories fade and all of
this and sometimes the courts are placed in precarious situations or excuse me
prosecutors are placed in precarious situations that when they look at the
date of a case and realize the overall overwhelming responsibility of going
and finding all the witnesses and doing all this and then they know the
individual has been incarcerated for 10, 15, 20 years. That has an impact on
their ability to prosecute the case. So while I understand and I use that in a
case that's on another one of the requests, is that they basically have to say, you
know what, we can't retry this case, so they choose to know a process, and I respect
that.
But that is my concern, is that these two individuals and the victim did all have guns,
and they were firing, and if you look at the evidence as presented in court that shows
is what goes on, I mean, I think the most critical
in me knowing what standard I was held to as a law
enforcement officer, then I know that if I would have
fired around through the roof of a vehicle after
disengagement, I would have had a really hard time
justifying that use of force at that level.
And so my concern is in talking about the commission
is that it's an unbalanced process correct.
And these right here are based on an unbalanced process.
And so while I can't say that I would not support
giving any of these things out,
I do disagree with my fellow Senator
that having two committee meetings
without all of the information has not educated us.
It has not.
The stuff I received from the GBI,
I received this morning because my intern
drove to the GBI and picked it up.
And I've just started the process on that.
And that's my concern because the monies
that we're going to hand out
Do you not come from, it's not us chipping in a fair amount up here.
There's 11 million Georgians responsible for us making the right decision.
And while I applaud what you're trying to do, I absolutely support changing the structure
of this.
So it is more fair and equitable.
I just feel at this point, based on the evidence I've read and the rest reports and stuff
like that, that I have an issue with the word exoneration.
And so that's my only thing.
And I have a tremendous amount of respect for you,
Representative Evans.
I've followed your career.
I just don't necessarily agree with the definition
that this commission is using for exoneration.
Thank you, Senator.
Appreciate it.
And briefly, Mr. Chairman,
the physical evidence always supported self-defense.
And the eyewitness that was thought to be dead
that the Fulton County District Attorney refused to hear from
since 2009, all the way until now,
testified that she was still shooting. That's why they went in and got guns and
where those bullets went when they were trying to duck and keep from getting hit
where they might have gone. I couldn't say but she was shooting out the window.
She was shooting toward them.
When you and Senator Robinson are doing right now, doing the court thing again
all over again. Well, agree, Mr. Chairman. And one thing I wanted to add, the court
heard all this the court and the court decided that witness should be heard
there should be a new trial and also I would add that I might not have
mentioned this in the last hearing I can't remember but the Fulton County now
has a conviction integrity unit they looked at this these were the first
gentlemen exonerated under that unit so this wasn't just looked at by the court
system which in and of itself is a multi-layered process and then looked at
again by prosecutors who I believe if there was a shred of evidence would have
moved. This is why I'm more than ever. We need the first bill to be passed on.
Absolutely. It's just an eternal mission to you did it. You didn't do it. I mean,
it never ends. So I think at some point we don't have to go with what we got
perhaps the best thing we did was pass that first resolution today so we
can get to where we feel comfortable. So okay. And then you don't have to get
into law enforcement against,
seeming to be against the other guy and all that stuff.
Agreed, Mr. Chairman.
The last thing I'll say is that,
unless you want me to keep talking, I can talk forever.
I need you from the other people.
Absolutely.
Thank you for representing them.
I don't want to be abusive of your time.
Sure.
Let me hear from the other two people coming up.
Thank you for and will.
And then I act on Senator Robinson's motion.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
And we've got to move for ten more minutes to represent the Buckner and Buckner and
Reps and Houston come up at the same time and make your final comment before we act
on the motion from Senator Robinson.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Debbie Buckner and I have HR 55 and HR 74
I kind of feel the same way that Representative Housen just said, I'm not an attorney and I was approached by law enforcement officers who were from the new area that I was drawn into with redistricting.
I knew nothing about the case and so I did what I thought was the appropriate thing based
on the process that we have today when we are asked to carry a compensation resolution.
I visited with the detectives, the police chief and I also met the person who had been
exonerated and released from prison and I talked to his supervisors at his job at the
humane society where he works for the city.
To me, this is the most stressful bill
where anybody in the house or senate will ever have to carry.
Every day we're up here making decisions about groups of people that are nameless, but
this is a person, this is a name, and this is someone I met, and this is someone who
went through being falsely accused at a time when they were desperate to find someone
that had committed some crimes and he just happened to be a in his own words, simple-minded,
uneducated man that was picked up and was accused.
And he had one trial that lasted one day with a set of jury and I most speeded up, I promise
I know people will come in and say eight minutes they have.
This man has sat in jail for over 20 years.
I'm frustrated because I started on this hoping to help a constituent who has gone through
the extraordinarily difficult process to be exonerated, to be released from prison, to
be told he was finally heard that he was not guilty of what they accused him of. He
had maintained his innocence. If we are going to use DNA evidence to identify those who commit
crimes, we've got to use DNA evidence to release people from crimes that they were falsely
accused of. Okay ma'am at this time would you make your final comments as well. And I'm
sorry about the time but it's just the time of season passing in the Capitol.
I was talking about the claims advisory board not receiving information from the prosecutor
or the victims that's actually factually inaccurate. The claims advisory board did seek
out and does seek out and it's actually written into the rules and regulations of the claims
advisory board that they have the power to seek out.
And in this, in Mr. Talley's case in particular, the prosecutor submitted a letter as well
as at the claims advisory board reviewed that as well as the press release that was gone
out at the time and the letter from Chief Decmar indicating that he believed that Mr. Talley
was innocent.
So these are, in a sense, cases, all four of these that are being brought before you,
and postponing them for a year leaves these people that have been in prison for decades,
not earning any money, not establishing any credit, not getting any social security payments
going in, coming out with absolutely nothing, Mr. Terry Talley works for the city, and he
makes $391 a week postponing this in his case, in all of these cases, is detrimental to people.
These are lives of people who are wrongfully convicted, who are trying to get reestablished
in the community.
I recognize the need of a strong bill and it's fantastic that we passed out Representative
of Holkins bill.
However, we should not kill these other ones,
because that could solve the problem next year.
Okay, I've got to cut it off right away.
A few minutes ma'am, I'm sorry about this.
If you can, a few comments and then we got to vote.
This is-
I just did, we will be very brief.
Yes, but-
So thank you, I'm here again on House Resolution 70
on behalf of Mr. Devanya and men.
I'm sorry Senator Dulles-Olly did not get
to hear the presentation in the earlier committee.
Mr. Inman served 23 years in prison for a murder
that he did not commit, and we have talked a lot
about exoneration, and we have talked a lot
about the benefits of bringing in experts.
The great thing in this case is that we have
those voices in this case.
In 2019, the presiding Justice Namios,
one of the most highly respected jurists
and the former prosecutors said about my client,
Mr. Inman, during my decade of service on this court,
I have reviewed over 1,500 murder cases
in various forms.
In those cases, trial courts, habeas court,
and this court, through a Pell Review,
have occasionally granted new trials to defendants
who appear not to be guilty of crimes
for which they are convicted.
Of the multitude of cases in which a new trial
has been denied, Inman's case is the one
that causes me the most concern
that an innocent person remains convicted
and sentenced to serve the rest of his life in prison.
Let justice be done.
He closed his opinion.
Thank you very much and I apologize for the time,
but it's at the brust of this committee
that we have a vote pending.
And the motion is to table the issues for the Romanian bills
until next meeting, which is obviously
going to be next year.
All in favor say, I pose like raise your hand,
otherwise I'll notice.
All in favor raise your hand on the motion,
the favor of the motion.
I'm not raising my hand, I was asking a whole year, okay.
Opposed like son, what do we have here?
It's a tie zone here.
Tie zone here, what is it, two to two?
Tie zone here, two to two to two to two to two to two.
I would vote with my colleague right here because he said
that we didn't have enough time, so we'll,
and we have no time to actually move on anyway,
but I believe.
I'm not. Yeah, it's too late. Yeah, I'm the two users. Let's say again. What is the motion right now?
I mean, what what posture are you in? They're just two years to come back after you've been released. No, man. It's
it's next session. Am I right about that? Yes, it goes all. Did you give us a platter? I guess four
resolutions have been tabled in order to really give this the time that it deserves.
I would suggest that we find a time during the summer if we can get the documentation
Senator Robertson has to each of the members of this committee that we would then take
time over the summer review and that we would take action upon this whichever direction
we go immediately upon returning the start of the next session.
So you voted with him.
But the vote is 3 to 2 in it.
It would be a 3 to 2 in it.
From the same emotion like the judges over at the court here
and superior courts should I get the same information you get?
Yeah, I would.
The vote is 3 to 2 that we were table anyway.
Well, I just wanted to say if the court has the same information
you made, we're dismissed.
Thank you.
You
