The chair here's none in the resolutions are adopted You know Park will read An invite resolution Caption A resolution Recognizing and commending the director of the House budget office Budget and research office Martha Rigby Wigden For her decades of devoted and skillful circus service to the Georgia General Assembly and inviting her to be recognized By the House of Representatives To assist the chair in the invite resolution The chair recognizes the chairman of the House appropriations committee chairman England You Good afternoon, everyone You know a lot of special people pass through our lives and There's young lady standing beside me here this afternoon that Has certainly passed through my life And made it better by her passing through There's 11 million other Georgians They could say the same thing You know the the quiet servants that work behind the scenes they never seek the attention They never ask for the attention They do a job they do a job because they love the job they do For the last 11 years Martha has headed up the House budget research office And For a couple of decades before that she worked in various other Places and and parts of the General Assembly she started across the hall in the Senate and Had the good sense and good favor to decide to come over to the House side but all joking aside She has been a dedicated public servant not To any particular party not to any particular person But to all 180 of us here in the House And many of those in the Senate that that she worked with while she was there and many that continue to call on her today with questions and just needing to know sometimes what's going on to help better undershore

and certain things. So, you know, Martha's been with us for 32 years. She started when she was five years old. My wife taught me to say things like that. Martha has enforced those things. But, you know, it's been 32 incredible years. She will be retiring from state government at the end of this calendar year. So, December 31st of this year will be her retirement. And truly, for the last 11 years, has been one of those people that I have leaned on almost daily, if and quite honestly daily, in the role that I've played as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. But, she has certainly been a rock, not just for me, but for every one of you sitting out there as well. There's no bigger fan or no bigger advocate for staying employees. And no bigger advocate, quite frankly, for the citizens of Georgia, than Martha Wigden has been during her entire tenure. So, I'm going to let the speaker say a couple things, and we're going to love on her a little bit. You know, I've been here a total of 26 years, with counting six years that I was lost and staggering through the wilderness on the other side. She was in the Senate when I was in the Senate. When I came back to the House, guess what? She was in the House. So, she has been there every step of the way with me and has been an invaluable resource. She does love this House and takes much, much pride in the work that we do. She doesn't respect party, extremely fair person. And it's important to her that people like Chairman England and myself have all of the information that we need. The morning after I was nominated for Speaker of the first time, the first stop I made was the House Budget Office. And there I was told the condition of our state's economy. And I thought, I wonder if it's too late now to withdraw the request for this office. But she laid it out for me and when we got through that session. And it wasn't easy. But she's been a great, great director in this position. I really don't want even to imagine that office without her. But she has taken a lot of pride in the office and they have pride in her as you can tell there all here today. And she's recognized nationally a couple of years ago. She was honored with an award as the number one staff person or something like that. By NCSL, I know I got the name of it wrong, but it was a very, very prestigious honor that gave her, honored her above all others in legislative staff work in the country. So Martha, we're proud of you. We're going to miss you. But I'm keeping your cell phone number in my phone. So you're going to be working for still for free occasionally. Please help me welcome to the podium, Martha Wigden. Thank you. We got business to do. Thank you. Truly humbled. And it has been an honor and a pleasure to work for the legislative institution. What a great institution. And I just take so much pride in how we get things done here and how much we can accomplish when we all work together. The staff, the House Budget Research Office, the staff throughout the legislature in Georgia is phenomenal. And I stand up here to your applause, but really it belongs to everyone who works to get the job done around us. Our staff, the talent, the dedication is incredible. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you to my family. Thank you. I've raised three children here as a single mom. And you all have wrapped your arms around me to enable me to do that. My children have been so supportive, proud to say that all three of them are in some form of public service now. So the tradition carried on. They heard you as they grew up. They used to run around, play on a hand truck through the halls on Saturdays and Sundays while we were working. So they're all familiar with the place, but without them and their support, and what they've been here, it's an honor to work for people who also cherish the institution the same way that we do and put the good will and the good policy for people ahead of everything else. So it's been a pleasure to serve you. And we have a few more months left, so a lot can be done. But thank you. Appreciate the honor. learned I know some of you may want to greet Martha and maybe get your picture made of other so she'll be out in the south anti-room and we'll do the greeting out there. If one of you are being one can go out there that'd be great. All right we're back on the rules calendar. We are back on the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 573. Senate Bill 573, my Senate will brass the 28th Walker, the 20th Roberts of the 29th to be entitled to an act of men. Chapter 7, Title 31 of the district of Georgia and Tate related to regulation and construction of hospitals and other health care facilities. So as required hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers utilize surgical smoke evacuation systems during surgical procedures. This bill I refer to the committee on health and human services that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Newton to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. What we're dealing with in Senate Bill 573 today deals with the challenging problem in our operating rooms and surgical suites, particularly those who live their entire working lives there. When electrocouver is used to try to control blood flow or bleeding there's a smoke. What's called surgical smoke this produced the nurses the OR techs the surgeons anesthesia providers all are exposed to this 40, 50, 60 hours a week sometime. While most facilities do have a procedure for dealing with this there are still ones in Georgia that do not. The 3573 will require that all facilities have a policy and that includes hospital operating rooms or surgery centers to contain surgical smoke evacuation. It just requires them to have a policy recognize that this can be a challenge. It can be a problem for those who who are working in that area. We certainly want to take care of our operating room nurses our OR techs our anesthesia providers surgeons we want them to be as healthy as possible. This bill will just help us achieve that and take one step forward to protecting our healthcare workers that we value so much in those particular operating room settings. To speak I'm glad to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you I appreciate your support on Senate Bill 573. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

He's 80% recovered and friends this bill simply does one thing it says that if you offer a kidney or if you have a liver transplant to an individual who needs it whose life will be continued that an insurance company can't cancel it can't change your policy or it can't deny you coverage on life insurance. That's it.

Thank you miss speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of house I present you Senate bill 486 this is a bill from senator Tyler Harper this bill is dealing with the agriculture commodity commission and propane what it's doing is it's changing the code section for relating to the public hearings and marketing orders for it's going to have it where you can have it either. In person or you'll be able to possibly do it remote communication it also be able to not put the notification in the Atlanta journal or a lot of paper it will also allow for you to do it on the website of the commissioner and the farmers and consumers market bullets to know the publications it also does it all the testimony will be public it changes the effectiveness. Proposed assessment of the effect it would be from 50% to 25% and then the vote for this will be two thirds instead of 50%. This bill was carried last year for all the other general commodities by senator Lee Anderson and SB 247 we passed it unanimously. So what had happened this being a different code section this bill had to be brought today to get propane up standards with that so Mr. Speaker that is the bill and with that you're well. Gentlemen is yielded to well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate bill 486 the eyes are 154 the nasors zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for past. We'll read the caption to Senate bill 479. Senate bill 479 by senator hatched the 50th miller 49 to 30th and others the talent act to amend code section 16 11131 in the fiscal to Georgia and Tadda relating possession of firearms by convicted felons and first defender probationers. So it's to specify that each firearm possession or attempted possession of certain offenders shall be charged as a separate offense. Miss Bill ever in for the committee and traditionally non civil that committee recommends a dis bill do pass chair recognizes representative lot to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker I am here to present today SB 479 which makes certain that a felon who receives possesses or transports a firearm is charged for each firearm connected to that violation. SB 479 adds two lines to code that clarifies language so that each firearm that a felon possesses shall be charged as a separate offense. Prior to 2018 and the Supreme Court case of codes versus state Georgia did charge for each firearm but that decision made it so a felon could possess an unlimited number of firearms and be charged with only one crime. SB 479 takes action to ensure that convicted felons are held properly accountable when illegally possessing firearms. A few weeks ago this body unanimously supported the same language clarification that was needed from the code's V state case but it pertained to child pornographic images and child molestation and I ask for your vote again with this language clarification measure. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I yield for questions. Yes sir I yield chair recognizes representative McLean you're right for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker we'll floor leader yield. I do yes sir. Thank you as everybody might recall I supported the other measure that you brought forward regarding language clarification and child porn cases because I agree to the public policy. Obviously this is different right firearms and so my first question if I can get one or two in is can you articulate the specific policy basis for the law. For giving sentencing judges more than 10 years which is the current maximum for these felon possession charges. What is the policy rationale for expanding the amount of exposure for felon possession cases past 10 years to decades are potentially longer. So first I'll start with this policy specifically is the language clarification on the codes V state case where the word any had been used and then they determined that to mean one crime. That is why it's relative to what we did in the past this is exactly the same it is taking that word any and making clarification that it means each. And as far as extending a felons length of our number of charges or length of stay shall I say it is a deterrent it is a known deterrent and I do know that the Georgia Bureau of investigation has stepped up and spoken on this as well as the prosecuting prosecuting attorneys counsel to say that. They recognize that it is a deterrent and counties that do prosecute with higher charges that that criminals tend to avoid those counties versus lesser lesser sentences. If that answers your question I think so could I could with floor your yield for one final question. Thank you so much so speaking of deterrence and I don't want to assign to you but words in your mouth that you haven't said but in general when we debate about guns one of the refrains we hear a lot is that we want to protect the good guys right to have a gun but we don't want to reg over regulate because we don't think that those regulations do much to deter bad guys from getting guns anyway right this is an argument against gun control can you explain it if you agree generally with that framework. That reg government regulations don't prevent bad guys quote unquote from getting guns true how does this law which is basically just an increased regulation attempting to regulate quote bad guys with guns why would it do anything to stop the gun problem that we have. So this this law does not regulate a bad guy from getting a gun a bad guy will always have a gun what this does is it puts him in jail for a lot longer therefore he won't have one tomorrow. Okay well thanks for your time thank you mr. Speaker I yield the well lady is yielded the well we have another member who wish to be heard on the bill the chair recognizes representative the bill. Thank you mr. Speaker I rise today to oppose SB 479 I want to talk just a few moments on big picture criminal justice policy a perspective on that I acknowledge that there is certainly evil in the world there are evil people who have committed horrible crime. I want to acknowledge that this group is the exception and not the rule when you take a closer objective look at most of the folks who are locked up in our state prison system it's not this outlier of extremely wicked people. Often times our tough on crime policies that are intended for the worst of us also swallow up people who are not inherently wicked but they're just lost they're misguided and they've made some unfortunate mistakes. The word understand literally means to stand under and the definition is clear when you stand under you have better understanding when you have proximity you can better have insight and understanding something may look a certain way from a distance but when you look at the law you get up close and personal to it it often looks very different my profession lends me to a perspective where I have proximity to those who are justice involved I do in reach to the prisons and I work in reentry to find folks who are released from prison.

and a safe place and some support. So when you stand under our criminal justice and prison system, you begin to understand that there is a connection between educational performance and incarceration. We hover around 50 to 60,000 prisoners in our state system and most of them are school dropouts with a very low literacy skill set. Literacy is almost a perfect spot on predictor of the way that a person's life will turn out. It is commonly known, we have said it in this session, that third grade is the greatest indicator. A child who is not reading on level by third grade is significantly more likely to spend time and corrections. Some states have used this metric to determine future prison populations and prison construction. These are not evil people. It's just that the educational infrastructure has failed them. What is alarming right now is that currently two-third of Georgia third graders are not reading on level. That's a crisis in my mind. We need more investment into our pre-case system and that's paramount. And it's also more cost effective. It costs about $4,400 to educate a four-year-old in our pre-case system, but it costs us $25,000 a year to incarcerate someone. When you stand under our correctional and prison system, you begin to understand that our correctional facilities are filled with the poor. The overwhelmingly majority of the men and women in our prison system were represented by a public defender. They did not have the means or resources to law your up. And they had to take what they could, which is often inadequate. I know that many of our Georgians in prisons, if they had the economic ability for a top-tier attorney, they would not have been convicted, and many certainly would have received a more favorable sentence. I'm in complete agreement with Brian Stephenson, the author of Jess Mercy, who says, in our current criminal justice system, you are treated better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent. Therefore, wealth, not copability, is determining our outcomes. These people are not inherently wicked. They're poor. When you look under our prison and correctional system, you understand that people of color are overrepresented in our facilities. African Americans represent 30% of Georgia's general population, but they represent 61% of our prison population. Now listen, I'm not trying to play the race card here. This is just a factual reality. It's incontrovertible. It's irrefutable. The reality is that one in three black men in this century will spend time incarcerated. For men that look like me, that's one in 17. It's not that people of color are more criminal in nature. It's just this ratio simply reveals the racial bias that exists in our criminal justice system from beginning to end. Nationwide, there are more black men in our criminal system than were enslaved in 1850. When you take a deeper look and stand under this system, you will see the connection between the era of slavery and our current state of mass incarceration. There is a direct line between this history and our prison. Brian Stephenson also says that slavery didn't end in 1865, it merely evolved. Legalized slave labor ended, but then it shaped shifted to prison labor because of the 13th Amendment loophole. Slavery was illegal except as punishment for crime. So the effect was black men were released from their slave shackles only to be re-shackled as prisoners because of a crop of new laws passed in the South called black codes that were used to convict and incarcerate black men. So they went back to the same fields as prisoners. This evolved into convict leasing chain gangs, which was a major revenue stream in Southern states, including Georgia. You cannot even understand 21st century mass incarceration without contextualizing it with our slavery passed. That's why the teaching of honest inclusive history is so important to understand that the residue of the past is still upon us. We are not in a post-racial society. When you look under our prison and correction system, you understand the connection between mental health illness and incarceration. We've said it many times this session that the number one mental health service provider in our state is our state prisons. Because we have neglected more favorable policies to mental health, we have ranked so low in our access to mental health care and treatment. As a consequence, these individuals have ended up in our correctional system. These are not evil doers. They are not criminal. They are sick. They are ill. Thank God for HB1013. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for putting your political courtesy behind this because mental health reform is prison reform. So when we inventory our state prison population, one could argue that we have criminalized poverty, criminalized race, criminalized mental health. Now, something else worth mentioning, it cannot be ignored as there is an economic component at play here. That capitalism too often creeps into our criminal justice policies. Proof positive is the private prison industry. Some say that crime doesn't pay. I beg to differ. Corsific and other private prisons are profiteering on crime and punishment. Corsific is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. You can buy their stock right now. You can be a shareholder right now. It's selling at $10.20 as of this morning. I am in the process of visiting all of our state prisons. I'm about halfway through that. I got interrupted by COVID. But I have visited one of the Corsific prisons and the warden told me out of his own mouth that the state of Georgia is contracted to keep them at 90% capacity. So we have a supply and demand thing going on here. We have to keep feeding them customers. So these hard on crime policies help keep this business alive and ensure that we meet our contractual obligation. So in conclusion, I think there is a reason why my favorite spiritual teacher said I was hungry. When you fed me, I was thirsty. And it gave me drink. I was naked and you clothed me. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was in prison and you visited me. I think if we became more personally engaged and personally involved into this issue, we would have better proximity and subsequently better understanding moving forward rather than being hard on crime with these pile on punishments. I think we should consider being smart on crime and actually address the root causes of mental illness, poverty, low literacy and inequity. Which is big, I yield the wealth. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Sainz rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that this Republican led house has recognized this severity of not following our state's laws, while not infringing on the constitutionally protected rights, and there's nothing inconsistent about that? You have to gentlemen, so states, what purpose does representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that racism is institutionalized in the United States of America? I'm sure the lady believes that to be true. What purpose does chairman not rise? I'm sure the lady believes that to be true. What purpose does chairman not rise? I'm sure the lady believes that to be true. The purpose does chairman not rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't this bill simply about when a felon who's been convicted? Goes back and then has a crime with a gun that it's after the fact, and that's all this does. Just make sure that the criminal. If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he believes that to be true. What purpose does representative may not rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Although, Mr. Speaker, I am voting yes for this bill, is it not true that domestic violence victims are five times more likely to be killed when their abuser has access to a gun? Five million US adults have been threatened or non-fately injured by an intimate partner with the firearm. Women in the United States are 21 more times likely to be killed with the gun than women in other high-income countries. And is it not further true that out of all the ways an intimate partner kills their partner 55.9% of the time, it is with the gun. If the lady so states, it certainly sounds as if she has done her research. All right, we'll do one more. Chair recognizes representative Lerickia. What purpose does he rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that regardless of race and socioeconomics, the easy way to stay out of prison is simply by obeying the law? That's a pretty simple approach. Okay, have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 479. The eyes are 89, the nays are 62. The bill having failed to receive a constitutional majority has failed. What purpose is representative? Lot rise. Make a motion. State your motion. Motion to reconsider. The lady has moved that this house reconsider its action. And that will be on the next. Yeah, the next, I'll be able tomorrow's legislative calendar. The last three days are when we take them up immediately. What purpose does representative Cannon rise? She waves. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 397. Senate Bill 397, my senator Goodman of the eighth, tippens of the 37th, painted 54th and others, being titled an act to amend titles 15, 20, 25, 40, 42, and 43, of the official go to Georgia, Antietta, relaying the courts, education, fire, protection, and safety. I'm referring to the committee on higher education. That committee recommends a dis bill. Do pass. Chair recognizes representative Meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring before you today, House bill 397, a high school equivalency legislation bill. You know, as I was thinking, Mr. Speaker, about this bill, and its impact on society and what we do here is not for ourselves, but for others. Probably back to a theme of a book that I've been reading, you found in booksecket chapter 10, it talks about, it's a theme, it talks about five to go, and it's the stages that man goes through, throughout life, and that life is wherever changing, and it's never ending, it's a constant cycle. And those being growth, entanglement, unbelievable, almost refurbation, and also conversion. And Mr. Speaker, it goes further to remind us that we should never rest on our laurels, that we should continue to grow throughout our lives and ever changing. Which is what this bill allows us to do, Mr. Speaker. There are currently over a million adults, and with no high school education diploma in state of Georgia, TCSG is now offering and providing a multiple high school equivalency test for these individuals to take one being GED, one being the high set, and one being a career plus exam. Mr. Speaker, what this does is it adds the high set, as well as career plus to the code, allowing those individuals who may take those exams and come into our state number one to be recognized. And number two, for individuals in our state who are looking to get their GED or their equivalency to take one of these other two tests as well. The other thing that this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is within the current code, the GED, there is a payment for individuals who want to take this test. We've moved that payment from the backside up to the front, so if they're going ahead and go ahead and take it, we can go ahead and get that reimbursement from the George Student Finance Commission, to TCSG without having to wait on them to complete the exam, submit the reimbursement, reimbursement, and then make the transfer of funds. So Mr. Speaker, that's what the bill does, but entertaining questions if we have any. You'll for a question. Yes, sir. You'll for a question. Chair recognizes representative Weed Hour for a question. Mr. Jim, I appreciate you bringing this measure, assisting these individuals who want to further their education. As you have recently furthered your education, could you tell me how this bill applies to the theory of the LASDOL? As it applies to the theory of LASDOL, yes, or you know, we as members of the legislature, we have the ability to look at legislation as it grows old, to amend it, and bring it into a form that is more helpful to the individuals who across our state. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well and ask for your favorite consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate bill 397. The eyes are 147. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Senate resolution 463 will be postponed until the next legislative day. For what purpose does, I'm sorry, chair recognizes Chairman Carson. We're not going to recognize Chairman Carson. Members of the House will please take your seats. Members will please take your seats. I give attention to the member in the well, the chair recognizes for a special order representative, Cassia. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words for the final few days of the session for me. To be very honest, I just wanted to make sure you're here, my German accent, for last time. Right, so we accomplished that. I wanted to say a few words because this has been an incredible journey for me. Life is a journey and most of the time you really don't know where it takes you. I can assure you, if someone had told me about 24 years ago when we moved to the United States, that I one day would be a state representative in Georgia instead as well, I would have laughed out loud. But this is where life takes you. My family came to the United States in 1997 following a job transfer for my husband. And initially we thought we just would stay for two years. Right, we came a longer two years and we expected. And our kids were growing up as Americans. We gradually integrated in the American society. We liked it here. I became an adjunct professor. And slowly we integrated. And after a few years, we made the decision that we wanted to stay and we wanted to become U.S. citizens, which we did in 2011. And one of the main reasons we decided to become U.S. citizens because we said if we decided on when we decided to stay here, we wanted to be able to participate and have a voice and to do this. And this is my strong German democratic upbringing you need to have the right to vote. I started to get involved in my kids' schools, in the community, and eventually in local politics. And from this initial engagement, one thing led to another. I worked on several campaigns. And when the seat for House District 50 formally held by now Secretary of State, Brett Raffensberger, opened in 2018, no Democrat wanted to run. And I said, well, I'll do it. What could be the worst that could happen? I could lose. So, but as you can see, I apparently didn't. So, against the odds I won in one of the tightest elections that year. And I became to my knowledge, the first German-born American elected to the Georgia Assembly, and also one of the few immigrants in this body. For the record, we have 10% immigrants in Georgia, so I represent not all of them, but I think some of them. The last four years have been incredible for me, an incredible learning experience, an appearance I would not want to miss. But they also have been very trying. My first question really felt like drinking from a fire hose. Not only was it the legislative process so strange and foreign to me, I started to notice that I was really an odd one out. You know, most of you have lived in Georgia for a long time. Right, Dean Smary? I mean, a really long time. I overheard conversations of where you went to high school, where your families lived, and so on. For comparison, the longest time I ever lived in one place was 11 years in Greensboro, North Carolina. So I didn't even manage in Germany to stay long in a place, but I lived for 34 years in Germany. I'm probably the only person here in the assembly who hasn't lived in Georgia for Udels of years. But you know what? Citizen is not a question of seniority. Or for how long you lived in a place. Citizenship is about what you do at the place you make your life's home. I recently had the great privilege and honor to speak at the natural, at the naturalization ceremony here in Atlanta at the Federal Courthouse. That was one of the most humbling and moving experiences in my life. Seeing the faces of these new citizens from about 50 countries, their pride, their relief, also their hope, reminded me of the day I stood in their place and of my own journey, and also reminded of me why I ended up where I ended up here today. During that ceremony, I realized that probably the greatest accomplishment of my endeavor as a state representative is not how many builds I passed for the record. I didn't pass any, but then I served as a role model to other immigrants. My work as a representative encourages many to get involved in the political process, to get to know their communities, and to do their part to make this America, our America, the better place. And of that, I'm very proud. I also am very grateful for the incredible learning experience I had here and the opportunity to meet so many people whom I could learn from, and I want to thank just a few. My apologies, right away, I cannot mention each and everyone, but I assure you that I cherish all of you your support over the means a lot to me. I want to thank the former and the current minority leadership and the whole minority caucus for their support and work and guidance throughout the years. You have been incredible. And no speech can be given without mentioning Dean Smirie. You get two mentions this time. Thank you for always being there for answering my questions, or allowing me to when, when I had to get something of my chest, I wish you all the best for your endeavors in becoming an ambassador. I also want to thank my sweet maid Debbie Buckner for allowing me to raid her candy jar, not that we are not getting enough candy in the interim. But also, I mean, especially for sharing her political wisdom, I will miss those candy jar chats. And I wish to give a special thanks to my seatmate, representative Sam Park, who always had a response to my continuous questions about, can you tell me what this bill is about? And I want to give a special mention to a natural resource committee chair, Elaine Smith, because being on your committee gave me the opportunity to appreciate the great natural beauty of our state even more. I got to learn some really cool stuff. I now know where and how to go for tour to live, what a living sea shore is, what a sewer vortex looks like, and I even got to go out with the DNR state barologists. Yes, there is a state barologist. And we got to look for bear dens, which was a really cool trip. I want to thank Speaker Ralston, Betsy Camille at the clock, and everybody behind me for always being so professional and keeping us on track. Your work is truly appreciated. And I finally want to thank my husband Fabian Kalsha for his support and love. I could not have done it without him. While he prefers to stay in the background, he supported me through thick and thin, every high and every low of this public role provides. He is my best friend and the love of my life, and I am looking forward to spending more quality time with him. Many of you asked me why I chose not to run again, and the easiest answer is just, I think I have done what I could do best to the best of my abilities. And now is this time for the next person to take this work further. But before I close, I want to close with a few takeaways, with a few things that stand out to me, because I still feel I look at all this with the lens of an outsider sometimes. The realization that with whatever we do in here, with every bill we pass, we affect people's lives and livelihoods, whether we raise or lower the taxes, whether we provide better funding or access for mental health or not, whether we expend Medicaid or not, or whether we allow our own prejudices and convictions to blur our judgment or not. It affects people's lives and change for the better unfortunately comes very, very slowly. Sadly, the increasing devicesness has diminished our ability sometimes to truly reach across the political divide. And while I was very proud to be part of the passing of George Hade Cramville and the repeal of citizens arrest, I was sad and really sad that a young black man had to lose his life to trigger true action. And finally, the ever increasing emphasis on individualism and individual choices supplemented by the rise of populism. This we all cherish our individual liberty and freedom of choice. But the first three words of our Constitution say, we, the people, and not me, the people. As a society, we cannot function if we own new focus on individuals and we have to focus on the needs of the society as a whole. It is okay to criticize government, but there's a difference between wanting to improve government and advocating government nihilism. We need to bring back the we and we, the people. I will be leaving this body with gratefulness, but also with worries about we're heading. Regardless, I look towards the future with hope that integrity,

and justice and honesty will prevail regardless of the party that claims leadership. I'm truly honored, truly honored to have had the opportunity to serve the people of my district and the people of Georgia. I look forward to staying involved in my community and I will continue to work for better Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you everyone that has a true blessing to get to know you.
