Well good morning, another beautiful day in Georgia.
We will begin this day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 78th House District
Representative Demetrius Douglas.
Representative Douglas.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My esteemed colleagues,
before I introduce our speaker of the day,
I just wanted to say a few things about being ready
and everything that you do.
On the phone call yesterday I was called to check on our colleagues if he was okay out
of surgery, and I asked him these simple words, is there anything I can do for you?
And he said, matter of fact, yes.
So be careful when you ask, it's anything you can do.
You'll get put to the test right away.
So I have this team pleasure of introducing him today.
His name is Pastor Michael Jackson.
He was born and raised in the Grange, Georgia.
He's married to Mrs. Belinda Williams, Jackson.
I didn't mess it up right.
And they are proud parents of five children, eight grand.
He is joined by his wife and beautiful youngest daughter
and a few family members that's in the gallery.
where they all please stand.
And mama, will you ask please stand.
Will you give them a hand?
Thank you.
Pastor Jackson attended Cornerstone Christian University and is presently presiding, pursuing
a master's degree.
He is currently serving as a senior chaplain of the Grange Police Department, serving the
people, praying for our law enforcement.
In September 2006, he was called to be the senior pastor of Confidence Missionary Baptist
Church and remains to be the shepherd of that flock.
Through his leadership, the congregation continues to grow and is the light in the community.
Pastor Jackson have received numerous accolades for the community service and endeavors that
he does.
He is a man with a vision.
How I present to you, Pastor Jackson.
Good morning.
To speak a rather son and to my state representatives,
Bob Fremont and his absent and his staff.
Thanks for allowing me to share with you today,
especially to my family and all who came out
to support me on today.
I thank you to representative Douglas for introducing me.
It's an honor and it is a pleasure to be standing here today.
I have a scripture reading from today that I want to share with you
as I echo off of what representative Douglas have shared.
Ephesians 2 and 10 says, for we are God's masterpiece.
He has created us a new and Christ Jesus
so we can do the good things he has planned us a long ago.
Philippians 4 and 13 says, I can do all things
through Christ Jesus, who strengthens me.
But first Corinthians 3 and 9 says,
for we are call laborers in God's service
and your God's field and God's building.
Just for a few seconds, I just wanna share with you
on a thought making a difference, making a difference.
Barbara Milinski said, each one of us makes a difference,
But together, we make a change.
John Maxwell said these words, I want to make a difference
with people who want to make a difference doing something
that makes a difference.
Great leaders, we're not set out to be a leader,
but we're set out to make a difference.
It's never about the role, but it's always about the goal.
We must all realize that we've been called by God
for a particular assignment and we've been equipped by God
to do His will and to do His work.
We're all put here on earth for position
to simply to make a difference, to make a contribution.
And so as we start this 2020 session this morning,
we need to make up our mind that we came here
to make a difference.
We're created not to just consume resources,
but we're designed to make a difference.
It does not matter what ethnic group we come from, what part that we represent, what
our religious background, but we're all God's people and we're called to make a difference.
Do the work and learn to celebrate our success.
I want to share with you two things, how can we make a difference?
We can make a difference where the Bible says in Psalms 133 verses 1, behold how good
in how pleasant it is for brotherings to walk together in unity. Amon's three and three
says, how can we walk together, except we agree? So why should we make a difference, my fellow
representatives? Our world needs us. Our world depends on us. Our world would not survive
if people did not help one another and we need each other to survive. Where would the
world be without good Samaritans. Secondly, why would we make a difference? We
should make a difference or we should be different makers because God expects
that of us because we're all God's children. So as we continuously move into
2020 this first day, this session, as we go into day three of this session,
representatives, if we're going to make a difference in this house on a local
level on a state level, on a national level. We got to accept the challenges that
come and make a difference and begin to move forward. Matthew 513 says, ye are the
salt of the earth, but the salt is lost in favor, where shall it be salted. People need
to see a difference, a difference in our decisions, a difference in how we treat one another. Make
a difference, but not only make a difference, but learn to be the difference.
For first Corinthians 1538, it says, we must not resort to ungodly actions.
But as I get ready to leave you, I want to leave you with something.
Two things that I think will help us as we continuously move forward and make a difference.
Fellow representatives, we're going to make a difference, we got to move forward.
We must learn to evangelize our local community.
We must learn to evangelize our state community.
And if we evangelize our local community, our state community,
then we can evangelize the world and make a difference.
Representatives, if we're going to make a difference moving forward,
we got to develop future leaders.
Paul invested himself in training Timothy,
and Timothy was doing the same with other faithful men.
Last last we began to make a difference, ultimately moving forward
And to the future, it involves every member of this house.
The question I lead with you today,
will you accept the challenge to make a difference?
Will we move forward?
When do we make a difference?
We start today.
We start now.
For Philippians says, we can do all things
through Christ, who strengthens us.
Join me as we began to go to the Lord in prayer.
Eternal God, our Father, we thank you now
for this day, God, we thank you for your grace
and we thank you for your mercy.
As we come now, God, into this session, God,
we ask in that you touch everybody that's gathered,
touch every representative, God, touch every party,
touch the, I'll speak of the house right now, God.
We ask that you be with us in our decision making, God,
that we make wise decisions, God.
Help us to be able to move from the past Lord God but to more so focus on the future
God.
Help us to lay aside every weight that so easily beset us God.
As we go into another century, another decade God, help us to move forward as our people
Lord God.
Help us to move forward Lord God and make a difference in our community locally, nationally,
regionally, and throughout the world.
We thank you, God, for just being so awesome and so wonderful.
And then, God, we will not leave as you that you cover every speaker that's absent from
this place.
But we ask the special prayer for Representative Bob Tremor.
We thank you for it right now.
In Jesus' name, all of God's people said, Amen.
I pledge to the flag of the United States of America and to the public for which His
one nation and the indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

We're going on now to morning orders. Morning orders. Remembering the instructions that we're given
And yesterday, I'm going to limit morning orders to two minutes each this morning.
Chair recognizes for a morning order, Representative Bill Yeardah.
This past December, less than a month from when we lost our colleague J. Powell, we lost
Senator Greg Kurt.
He lost his courageous battle with cancer.
Greg was a loving husband, father, and grandfather.
Greg was a man of outstanding character and strong Christian faith.
He had a passion for serving those less fortunate.
He was especially interested in helping the disabled and taking care of families with
disabled children.
Greg also served as a pastor leading his congregation with the wisdom as a senior pastor.
Greg was also an entrepreneur in his community and worked hard to create jobs in his community.
He loved Georgia.
He loved Southwest Georgia.
He was a real champion of rural Georgia and led a variety of efforts to improve the lives
of rural Georgians.
He was most proud of sponsoring legislation that protects Georgians from being sued for
damages if they have to break into a vehicle to save an unattended child and what a legacy
that is.
Greg will be deeply missing the General Assembly, his district, and all over the state.
Greg Buddy, we'll see you on the other side.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes for a morning order the chair of the Health and Human Services Committee
Chairman Cooper.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues. Happy New Year. Today is Patient Advocacy Day here at the
Georgia State Capitol. And for many years, I've had the honor of recognizing this group
for the outstanding work they do on behalf of Georgia Patients with their advocacy. Thank
you for all of those that are here in our gallery. And to all that are here at the Capitol
today, they will probably be calling on you. I think them for their work. Patients should
always, patience should always be at the center of any legislation that we, as long makers,
make. As chairman of Health and Human Services, my goal is to protect our patients and to push
for healthcare systems to work for them, not for large corporations and organizations that
have their own self-interested heart.
Patients in Georgia deserve better quality healthcare access.
No matter what their socioeconomic background is, the color of the scan are their zip code.
This year, we will be working to build upon laws like the Patient First Act and many
others to provide better health care outcomes for patients across our state.
I look forward to working with all of you on these issues for better access to quality
health care for all Georgians.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Anulowicz for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning.
I am here today because it is cervical cancer awareness day in Georgia.
We have a group of advocates here, I think of some of you all in the gallery.
I would love to welcome you to the Capitol today.
We are working with the Georgia Cancer Control Consortium
and the Susan Jolly Awareness Program.
To make sure that everyone knows
that today is cervical cancer awareness day,
there is a lapel pen and some information on Georgia
in your desk.
I also want to share that there's also a news article
about Australia in which they have just
about eliminated cervical cancer
because of a robust HPV vaccination program.
So I want to tell everyone aware of that.
Thank you so much.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize those that are here for Cancer Awareness
Day and share a couple of statistics.
According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer
will be diagnosed in 2020, and over 4,000 women will be fighting this illness and die by
the end of this year.
While these statistics are scary, a lot of this can be prevented with early detection.
So, I would encourage all women who are Georgia to please see your primary care physician
this year and get a pap smear and hopefully we can eradicate cervical cancer in Georgia.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Gerald Greene for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On Monday, I will celebrate another birthday.
And that is also the holiday that we celebrate.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said,
the time is always right to do what is right.
And today on his birthday, we remember the life
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We remember him
for his determination and his persistence
to create a better world for future generations to live in.
A Georgian native, Dr. King was a minister, an activist,
and the most visible leader of the Civil Rights Movement
until his tragic assassination in 1968.
A copaster, the Atlanta-based Ebenezer Baptist Church,
He is known for leading the 1955 Montgomery Boy bus boycott.
The 1962 struggle against segregation and numerous non-violent protests across the country,
most notably in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama.
In August of 1963, he helped organize the March on Washington, where he delivered his
famous, I have a dream speech to a crowd of roughly 250,000 onlookers. On October
the 14th, 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality
through nonviolent resistance. As public servants, we should all strive to be more like Dr.
King. And again, in his words, the time is always right to do what is right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The chair recognizes the chairman of the legislative and congressional re-apportionment committee
Chairman Rich for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My fellow members and our guests in the gallery January is National Blood Donor Month, which
is an excellent time to celebrate the lifesaving impact of blood and platelet donors and to host
a blood drive.
We are currently hosting a blood drive as I speak in a bloodmobile between the CLOB and
the capital.
They will be there until 2 o'clock.
If you have not made an appointment, you can still show up and give blood.
While at Georgia State University, I gave regularly because it was easy.
The law school hosted a drive that was right outside my office.
And now we have a drive right outside of our offices.
For most of my life, my sister has been chronically ill, and too many times critically so.
Receiving the gift of blood is just one of the many intercessions that we've experienced
over the last 30 years, and I venture to say that most of us in this room have a loved
one who has also received this gift.
Not all of us are medically eligible to give, and there may come a day when I'm not, but
for now, while I can, I will.
You should know that the American Red Cross currently has a critical shortage of type
O blood and urgently needs blood donors of all types.
Right now they have less than a three-day supply of both O negative and O positive blood
types.
In January because of severe weather and seasonal illnesses, it's difficult for the Red Cross
to maintain a sufficient blood supply.
While we are having our wonderfully mild temperatures here, it is an excellent time for
us to walk outside and climb aboard the bloodmobile.
I would appreciate it if you all would take some time out of your day to make this amazing
gift of life.
Thank you.
I yield a well.
Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
I am bringing your black back for today.
So today, I would like to honor our 44th president
of the United States from 2019 to 2017.
President Barack Hussein Obama, he was the first
African-American president elected to
and the United States.
And he was regarded as a centrist new Democrat,
but he decided he signed many landmark bills
into law during his first years in office.
This includes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act, and repeal the Don't Ask Don't Tale in 2010.
In foreign policy, he increased the US troop levels
in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons
with the United States, Russia, and New Start Treaty,
and ended military involvement in the Iraq War.
He ordered military involvement in Libya,
contributing to the overthrow of Gaddafi.
He also ordered the military operations that resulted
in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected
Al-Qaeda operative, Al-Walaki.
A 2018 Gallup poll found Obama to be one of the most
admired man in America for the 11th consecutive year.
And in the words of the great philosopher Jay-Z,
Martin Luther King marked so that Rosa Parks cassette,
Rosa Parks set so that Barack Obama could fly,
and Barack Obama flew so that I could be here today.
That is your Black Fact for today, and thank you very much.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning. On this day, January 15, 1908, the illustrious
South Fukapa Alpha Sorority Inc. was founded and today our sisterhood is on full display
for the world. Our 112 year enduring legacy of supreme sisterhood and impactful service
is on display for all to see.
Alpha Fukapa Alpha Sorority Inc. is an international service organization that was founded on the
campus of Howard University in Washington DC is the oldest Greek letter
organization established by African-American college educated women with
nearly 300,000 members over 1,000 graduate and undergraduate chapters throughout
the international and United States. A wise African proverb says as long as the
names of our ancestors are called they will live on in our hearts. Now I like
at the call of the names of the 16 founders.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, it could have been me.
Maternal mortality is a big issue in Georgia,
especially among African-American women
who are three to four times likely to die
than any other race from pregnancy-related issues.
We heard from experts after experts
in the mortality house study committee.
When Georgia saw that meth and opioid were addictions
of issues that require specific remedies,
we made those recommendations.
Now that maternal mortality among African-American
women, we see it's an epidemic, and it needs to be addressed.
It could have been our sisters and has been our sisters, our daughters, our cousins,
and our friends.
The mortality-specific mortality-house committed study recommendations did not specifically mention
issues that are specifically related to African-American women.
It could be reduced and help to eliminate when there's a greater focus in Georgia on why
African-American women are dying and higher rate and that solutions can be given, especially
when 60% of those deaths can be prevented.
And the correspondence had been sent to the committee members in reference to this.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We year the way up.
Chair recognizes representative Kennerd
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Jimmy Meadows is scheduled to be executed
by lethal injection tomorrow in Jackson, Georgia
at the state prison.
If Jimmy Meadows would be tried today,
this would not be a capital case
for the state no longer seeks the death penalty
for the crime of which Mr. Meadows was convicted in 1989.
Just 20 minutes into its deliberations in 89,
Mr. Meadows jury sent a note to the judge asking
if they could impose a sentence of life without parole.
Unfortunately, life without parole
was not yet available in Georgia.
Their only option was the death penalty.
The Southern Center for Human Rights
representing Mr. Metters and has spoken with every living juror from his trial and they
all confirmed that life without parole would have been their verdict had they been given
the option to impose it.
And every single one of his surviving jurors support his clemency.
His clemency hearing is today before Pardons and Peroles.
Sudden Center further asserts that Mr. Metters could be cleared of the crime through DNA testing
of the murder weapon because DNA testing that was not available in 1989, unfortunately
a Glen County judge denied this request, a couple of observations. The death penalty
in this nation is flawed and is defined by bias and error. The Equal Justice Institute
founded by Brian Stephenson reports that for every nine people executed, one person on
death row is exonerated, one in nine, an astonishing rate of error when you're talking about
life and death. In his book, Just Mercy, Brian Stephenson writes,
Mercy is not something we give to people because they deserve it. Compassion is not what we give because it is owed.
It's what we do because it's the way that we find mercy for ourselves. Christ said it this way.
Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Dale Washburn to introduce the doctor of the day.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it is my pleasure and privilege to introduce Dr. Reina
Muner, who is our doctor of the day.
Dr. Muner began medical school at the age of 45 at Mercy University School of Medicine
and Makin.
She then completed her internal medicine residency at the Atlanta Medical Center, became
board certified and began her private practice in Macon.
Dr. Moonin was president of the Bib County Medical Society in 2013 and serves as a delegate
annually to the AMA House of Delegates.
She is on the faculty at Marshall University School of Medicine and routinely mentors
medical students there.
One of the things that Dr. Mooner with everything she has accomplished, and I'm departing from
the script for a moment, one of the things she has proudest of, understandably, is her
son Christian, who is in special forces and who has been deployed to Afghanistan on
three occasions.
He is now in special forces, as I mentioned.
Dr. Mooner is married to Joseph E. Glough, a cattle farmer who owns a rocking chair ranch
in Monroe County, and he is with us today.
He provides grass fed beef to several Georgia residents
and local markets.
Dr. Mooner has served us as Dr.
of the day faithfully over the years.
I asked her a few minutes ago, I said,
Dr. How many times have you done this?
And she said, well, I can't really remember,
but at least eight times.
And so it's my pleasure today to introduce to you,
Dr. Rainer Mooner, Dr. of the day.
Thank you so much for that.
This is a huge pleasure for me to be here to serve you today on behalf of Bib County
Medical Society.
We understand that this is a sacrifice for you and you're being selfless.
We know you don't get paid a lot to do this and it's hard.
away from your families, you're away from your homes.
I just want to tell you that one of the great things that Dale Washburn did when he ran
for office, he came and sat with us at the Bib County Med Society Board meeting one
morning and just gave us a chance to pick his brain and it was a great day.
We learned about him, we felt like he would represent us very well.
We went out as new advocates of his and look here who he is.
So use your medical societies and let them pick your brain once in a while.
They love to have you come sit with them.
I look forward to taking care of you today.
If you're sick, great.
If you're not sick and you have a medical question, just come and ask me.
I love to talk about medicine.
Thank you for allowing me to serve you.
The members of the house, please find your seat.
Find your seats. We have a very special recognition.
Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 886.
House Resolution 886, by the way.
We have green and 151st, we're all still in the 7th Chocos Thumb 38th.
Next to the 69th and Harold the 106th.
A resolution recognizing him and commending a Karen and Eric Bunk of Ritzland Distilling
Company and for other purposes.
Chairman Green was kind enough to let me say a word or two about these friends of mine.
We have talked a lot in this house over the last few years about rural development and
bringing jobs to rural Georgia.
Let me tell you something.
If you have never been to the Richland Rum to Stilery in Richland, Georgia, you are in
for a treat.
Eric, Vaughnck and Karen have brought that business.
I was there many years ago when they were having been off the ground very long and it is
a class organization and I understand that they are now in the top tier of sales all over
the world.
And it's rum made here in Georgia by Georgians putting Georgians to work.
Let me say one more thing.
That rum makes a fantastic rum cake, or so I'm told.
Chair recognizes Chairman Gerald Green for an invite
resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
He knows what he speaks of.
Many years ago, I was called to Richland, Georgia.
And they wanted me to come and meet some individuals.
And they cared me to, to burn down warehouses,
write their own broadsery, horrible-looking buildings.
And they said, we want to build a rum distillery here.
I thought, my gosh, that's impossible.
Well, I want you to know it's not impossible.
For those two individuals right behind me, Eric Vunk and his wife, Karen, they are the
hardest working individuals to bring about some revitalization to downtown Richland, Georgia.
And now they are in Brunswick, Georgia.
And so be careful if you are wanting a place, they'll be there too, but we're not going
to lose them in rich than Georgia. And I'm not going to take up much time. I want you to hear
from this individual Eric Bonk, please.
Mr. Speaker, representative Green, it's kind of hard to find words that adequately describe
the gratitude that Karen and I feel for the opportunity to be here and frankly we believe honestly
that the gratitude should be all ours. The Georgia we have learned to know Georgia
through an initiative by then Commissioner of Industry and Trade Randy Cardosa in 1991
to, as the best state to do business in the Union, it is absolutely true. The proactive
government support that exists here does not exist anywhere else. And with your leadership,
Mr. Speaker, and with efforts like yours, Gerald, and Alan Powell on the regulated industries
committee. We would not be able to have built this business, which now distributes
Richland-Rum made in Georgia in 15 states and exports it to 11 countries. As business
as entrepreneurs, we have registered two trademarks. One is Georgia's spirit and the other
one is the spirit of Georgia. Georgia's spirit is Richland Rum. It's only
ingredients are homegrown sugar cane and water from the Georgia aquifer. The
spirit of Georgia is what lives in the company. It's people and the state which
is home to the company. It's the spirit of Georgia that has developed us and is
now helping us to export the best spirit thinkable to mankind. Thank you so much for everything you've done over the years to make this possible.
I know we won't recognize it, but I have a little question.
I'm sorry, Representative Williams, for what purpose do you rise?
Elementary in the room.
State your inquiry.
Before they leave, I'm certain that there are samples in the alley room so we can get
into the spirit of George.
I'm going to let you take that up with Chairman Green over here, but I am sure if he's
done his homework, he had him bring some.
