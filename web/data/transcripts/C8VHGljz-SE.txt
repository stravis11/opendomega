----------
As we barrel towards the last day of our precious time here in this esteem body, please
stop wasting my time.
On behalf of the 60,000 strong I represent, please stop wasting their time.
playing in their faces, stop manufacturing crisis, stop making up stuff.
The Democratic Party and the Georgia House representatives have logged out of the House
Chamber, instead of standing in here fighting for fiscal responsibility of your tax dollars.
Anna Dramatic move, Georgia House Democrats walk out during the vote over banning Georgia
of prisons from providing gender-affirming care for transgender inmates.
Good evening and welcome to Lawmakers.
It's day 39, the last day before Sinidai.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta, we'll have more on the day coming up.
Georgia's business community is trying to adapt to some major changes these days.
They're tackling everything from how artificial intelligence is changing the business landscape
to figuring out the potential effects of federal tariffs.
In this session, they turn to the governor and the legislature for help in limiting damage
awards in civil lawsuits.
I had a chance to sit down with the president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber to discuss
challenges, the big win with the tort reform, and a look at what's next.
Also tonight, we'll talk about what's been memorable this session and what bills are
still hanging around before it all wraps up late on Friday, to people who closely follow
the action join the show.
first. Capitol correspondent Sarah Callis breaks down the 39th day under the
gold dome.
Hi, Donna, the House and Senate jumped into hyperdrive on day 39.
In the Senate, almost 90 bills and resolutions were posted on the rules
calendar as legislators hostile to pass as much legislation as they can in the
last two days of the session. HB 397 is a controversial bill dealing with a
a variety of voting measures.
We helped them streamline this thing,
and this has the blessings of Gabrielle,
who actually performs the elections all over the state.
It fixes the issues with our third party candidates,
and it stops counties from doing this pop-up voting sites.
Not true, say Democrats will pose the bill.
Election security is important,
but this isn't about security, it's about control.
It's about disenfranchisement and it's about keeping power in the hands of the few at
the expense of the many.
Georgians want elections that are free, fair and accessible, not the partisan attempt
to put more roadblocks between the people and the ballot box.
They say it erodes voting rights by removing Georgia from Eric, the Electronic Registration
Information Center, gives unconstitutional power to the state election board and would
no longer allow absentee ballots to be hand delivered the weekend before elections.
The ability for a voter to drop off an absentee ballot the weekend before election is a
critical one.
It's a crucial access point that this bill would take away.
And in an era where we have seen that the post office is wholly unreliable, many voters
have relied on dropping it off the weekend before a election because life happens.
The bill passed along party lines, 33 to 23.
The two house bills recognizing homegrown Georgian foods, cornbread and brunswick stew,
were both Frankenstein into new bills.
HB 14 would have made cornbread the official state bread, but was changed into the Georgia
Music Office and Music Reddy Communities Act.
And HB 233 would have made brunswick stew the official state stew, but was co-opted into
not only the stew, but also making the fourth Friday each November National Sugarcane
syrup day in Georgia, became the new home for the missing cornbread bill, and prohibits
state agencies from contracting with any country considered a foreign country of concern.
Both were passed, but no word on if the changes left a bad taste in anyone's mouth.
And in the House, recognition of one of our own, as long-turned-camera men, Wesley Nichols,
was recognized for his 25 years of contribution, covering the legislature for lawmakers.
We are thrilled to honor West on his quarter century career milestone capturing Georgia politics and another special guest in the chamber Georgia first lady Marty
Camp. She was joined by Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Commissioner Kevin Tanner to talk about 988 the mental health crisis hotline in 2023 only 16% of
Georgia's had heard of 98. A poll that we did recently, 84% of
Georgia's have now heard of 98. And a lot of that is because
of work that the First Lady's done helping us spread the
word. Then the House moved on to the first of several rules
calendars. Members approved Senate Bill 17 or Ricky and a
Lisa's law named after two school shooting victims. The
legislation originally in the bill to create a panic button
system in classrooms was added to the school safety bill past
Monday, so this version of SB 17 added clarifying language.
We passed this in the school safety bill.
This is just the amendment and cleanup.
Members had personal testimony about this issue.
I waited a day or two before I asked my child if he had heard the news and asked him how it felt.
I asked him if it made it feel scary or if it made him feel anxious.
And he said no mom, that school only had one resource officer.
Our school has two when an active shooter comes we're going to be better prepared.
That was the day I realized that my child uses the word win, not if, when he thinks about
an act of shooter coming to his school.
The bill passed unanimously, and a demonstration from the Democrats in protest of SB 185.
The bill would ban the use of state funds for gender-affirming care for transgendered
prisoners in Georgia.
Democrats spoke in opposition.
What is it?
What is going on with my colleagues that they have become so obsessed with what is happening?
transgender citizens, panties, and their underwear, and their boxer shorts, and their bed
rooms, and their medical rooms, when they talk to their doctors, when they deal with
their families.
Why is it that this has become such an obsession?
And then walked out of the chamber.
Republicans were quick to criticize the move.
Probably the most disheartening moment I've ever had my service here as a member of the
House.
to two.
In an unusual move, the Senate also passed SB214, which requires voters to use paper ballots
in elections.
The bill will have to wait until the next legislative session to be considered, since
it didn't pass before crossover day.
That's my Capitol report, Donna.
Thanks Sarah.
Every year, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce supports hundreds of bills that help businesses
across the state, regardless of their sides.
I recently chatted with the president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce to get
his insights on how this legislative session is shaping up for the business community.
We talked about some important topics like the need for a skilled workforce, the challenges
businesses are facing related to AI, and how some companies are preparing for the impact
of tariffs.
But first, we took a dive into a big win for the Chamber, civil lawsuit reform.
We were very excited and appreciative of the Governor, the Speaker Lieutenant Governor
of Passing, really the first piece of tort reform or lawsuit abuse reform.
And it put in perspective with me the other day when I realized it was 20 years ago this
year that the Georgia Chamber worked with Governor Perdue to pass the first round of
tort reform in Georgia.
And it's been 20 years of work every day with our members and with the General Assembly.
And so, you know, our hope here is that we see a reduction in some of the frivolous lawsuits
that we see some insurers return to Georgia,
that have left, that we see some stabilization of rates.
And it may be most importantly,
we can actually see some of our rural hospitals
improve their ability to attract doctors,
particularly OBGYNs, into some of the parts of the state
that really just haven't been able to keep those physicians
in place.
And so Big Bill, 69 is still out there.
Some other bills that are still in that space,
but the governor's Senate Bill 68 was a huge win, a huge step.
Let's talk about 20 years.
Yeah.
What happened in that space, that tort-reform space over 20 years?
So what happened primarily was in those first five or six years
after that, the court system overturned a lot of those findings
that the general assembly passed.
And the general assembly, for whatever reason,
we didn't come back and fix them
when the courts pointed out that there were flaws and out there.
And so between that and then a lot of new calls of actions
being passed at the same time.
The business community suffered through that.
We made our points, but it wasn't until about three years ago
that we decided that we really needed to engage differently.
The governor was very engaged.
He wanted to, you know, he's traveled the state this year
listening to businesses and doctors and everyone
to really hear what those issues were.
And then he came out with his two bills in January.
And you had some heavy hitters, you had Waffle House,
you had Uber, you had those big executives involved.
You had those executives, but I think what was more important
is if you look at that first press conference
the governor held and you look behind him.
I look behind him, I didn't see all the CEOs up there.
When I saw, we're hardworking Georgians
in their home depot aprons, in their Waffle House aprons
and their hard hats and their lab coats,
they said, this matters to me and my family
and I wanna be here.
And we heard, I mean, every community that I toured
in the last three months, we heard from small business owners
with their stories.
Just, we heard from doctors saying they were shutting down
their practices because their physicians were moving
to North Carolina.
I mean, we heard those horror stories everywhere we went.
So this wasn't just about the grass tops.
This was the grass roots.
Every day, hardworking George and saying,
we need to see a change.
Do you worry about lawsuits like you had 20 years ago?
Of course.
And I think what we'll do this time is we'll go in
and we'll battle those out and we'll try to preserve
What Governor Kemp said was important, what our members say is important, and we
need much more vigilant than our predecessors were 20 years ago.
Let's talk a little about insurance reform.
So that is something that people are saying that's next year.
What are your feelings about that?
So I think we have to, first of all, we need to make sure that these changes that go into
68 and 69 have chance to work.
What we saw in Texas, what we saw in Florida is that those rates did come down.
In Texas, they saw med mal rates go down 54%.
two years, but they saw them go in.
So, listen, last year, I consider what the governor passed last year was insurance form
when insurers had to provide all that data to John King.
We trust Commissioner King with what recommendations he might come back with as he looks at that
data.
And so, we'll be part of those discussions, but I think we've got to let...
I think we'll see more insurers come back to the market because of what we've passed
this year.
And the more competition in that market, the lower the rates are going to be.
If you only got two or three companies that are writing, you know, trucking, underwriting
for trucking companies, they're going to set their own price.
If you got 20 coming in, it's a much more competitive market.
And so that's what our hope is that we'll see some immediately stabilization, and then
we'll work with the commissioner and others next year.
So you'll see some companies who want to come into Georgia, stay in Georgia because
they think insurance will stabilize at least if nothing else.
Right.
And hopefully they don't, we don't see the frivolous lawsuits, we don't see the nuclear
verdicts at the same level. We've closed some of those loop holes and our hope is the
insurers we've talked to said we want to be in Georgia. We want to underwrite in Georgia.
Just not feasible for us right now. Okay let's change gears a little bit and talk about
your strategic plan. Georgia 2050 what is that? So in January after almost two years of
traveling the state listening to our members listening to legislators elected leaders at the
local level, we unveiled Georgia 2015. It's a bold 25-year outlook for the
state's economy. So it's more than just our strategic plan. It's really a
strategy for the state's economy. And what we heard from business leaders,
that we weren't just thinking four or five years out, that they were making
investments for 20, 25 years. And you think about it this way. We were at
Hyundai's Meta Plant Grand Opening and announcement last week with the
governor. They were very clear. This is not a short-term investment. We're
We're going to be here for the next 100 years.
To fix the interstate going into Savannah is a 20-year project to build two new nuclear
reactors is a 20-year project.
To deepen the port of Savannah is almost a 20-year project.
And so we felt it was important to look long-term.
So this plan looks at the data, how Georgia's growing, where it's growing, what the business
is going to look like, what the disruptions are going to be.
And Donnet focused on five kind of core pillars, as we call them, making sure we've got
the right workforce and talent in place.
In case you're those young men and women
can AI proof their careers,
that's what our big concern is.
Number two, to make sure that we've got
the energy production in place
and the infrastructure investments that we need,
to make sure that we're focused on growing
the next generation of innovators
and entrepreneurs in the state,
that we remain a competitive and vibrant location
for economic development.
And at the end of the day,
that we have regional prosperity and healthy community,
so that every community in Georgia
has the chance to grow,
and we've got the right healthcare supported systems
in place to help them do that.
And so every policy, every event, every program,
every bill at the Capitol that we work on
falls under one of those five pillars.
First of all, let's talk about where are we now
if we don't make some changes?
I think there are two things we need to look at.
Number one is we have to get many women
that are disconnected from the workforce today back in.
If everybody that wanted to work could find a job
and have the skills, we'd be at full employment.
That's what we have bills like Senate Bill 207
on occupational licensure reform coming
from Senator Strickland to make it easier for men and women
that have been incarcerated to get the license
they need to go into the workforce.
And so that's part of what we got to work on.
The other part is looking at generation alpha,
which are our elementary, our middle school kids right now,
to make sure that they've got the skill sets they need
to be horrible 20 years from now
when they get out of college.
And that they've got the right skills in place
is AI disrupts their first choice career
and their second choice career.
So there's a lot of work that's got to go on in that space.
We have a couple bills that the governor supported this year,
best place for talent being one of those.
And so we've got to have those types of policies.
But I also think we've got to be much bolder.
The fact that my son's a freshman at UGA right now,
go dogs.
He graduated with much the same class schedule
that I had 30 something years ago.
And that's not going to work in a system
where kids need more real world experience,
more technology experience, more humanities,
we're gonna have to really rethink K through 12,
I think, in the long term.
What were the bills that dealt with AI
that you were looking at this session?
So I think there's a lot of concerns,
we didn't have any specific bills,
there are lots of bills that kind of floated out there
on data privacy and artificial intelligence,
and I think our concern has been,
and it will continue to be.
Our companies online transcend states,
they transcend countries.
And if every state has its own artificial intelligence bill
and its own data privacy bill,
all of a sudden your company, my company, everyone else,
we've got 50 different states
that we've got to watch their laws for.
And so we think that's a national solution
that tells us what the parameters are for ethical AI
and for ethical data privacy
and that we're punishing the bad actors
and not the mainstream mom and pop companies
that get hacked even though they did everything
they were supposed to do.
And so that's been a lot of our education
at the Capitol this year is helping legislators understand
this is a very big issue, it's a national issue,
and let's make sure that if we do pass bills,
they look like a bill that North Carolina passed
or Alabama passed so that we're all on the same page.
Well, almost a sunny day.
What are you looking for in the next few days?
So we still need to pass a couple of bills
in tort reform, like the Governor Senate Bill 69
needs to move out of the Senate or out of the House.
That deals with third party and foreign litigation
to make sure that people aren't abusing our legal system
from Russia or from China or from London for that matter.
And then we've got a couple of more bills on tax
that we want to get out.
But I think those will all move easily.
And quite frankly, at this part of the year,
you play a little bit of defense to make sure
that something that has unintended consequences
doesn't undermine what you've been working on.
OK.
I've got to ask, some of the cutbacks
at the federal level, especially grants,
are already hitting some of the business community in Georgia.
So, what are you hearing from your members,
and what are you saying to them?
So, a lot of our members are worried about
what the impact of tariffs are gonna be,
the word about cuts, particularly in research and development.
We have a lot of research universities in Georgia.
We've spent out a lot of companies from those.
So, we're now part of a national coalition
that's looking at how you fund science, research,
and development to make sure that we're telling
the right story, and we're getting those dollars
that are available back into our universities
into our state.
You know, I've heard from the President of Morehouse an
Emory about the potential impacts there.
So we're just trying to be a good advocate, make sure that
our members of Congress understand where those dollars go,
the impact that they have, and the fact that they're
spinning off companies every single day in Georgia.
And that's the great work of the Georgia Research Alliance.
So we're trying to advocate and be a good partner there.
And then obviously on tariffs, we're just trying to work
with our partners all over the country, all over the
world and make sure that Georgia businesses know what they
know what they need to do in order to be compliant and to mitigate or to lessen the impact
of any of those tariffs and continue to talk to our friends in Washington every day about
the potential impact.
I want to thank Chris Clark for that conversation.
That interview took place before the final passage of SB 69, another of the tort reform
bills.
It is now also on the governor's desk.
Well, coming up, as the session winds down, we take a look at what made this one stand
out the twists and turns and what to expect on Sinydai. We'll get analysis from two people
who have watched the legislative process on full this year and have done so in the past.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPP.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers at the State Capitol during the session and
year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
And a queen. I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman. People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse.
Immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it.
Five-knowledge in our own worth.
1.
Oh please, do continue.
2.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2,000 years.
This is amazing.
I'm excited now.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
Well, I'm excited now for it.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking, but look at this. It really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually
altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry.
You might say every Georgia legislative session
has its own vibe.
Tonight, we're going to discuss some of the bills
that made this session unique and look at
what's yet to come as things wrap up.
Joining me is journalist Ty Tagami.
He's a reporter with Capitol Beat
who is covering state government and Capitol Beat is a partner with GPB and you'll find the stories on gppb.org.
Also here is political analyst, commentator Bill Crane, who is often on local and national media outlets.
He is the owner of CSI Crane Communications. He also writes the column One Man's Opinion. He'll give us his opinion tonight more. Welcome to Lawmakers to both of you.
Let's start with this session.
I talk about each one having its own vibe.
How would you describe it?
I'll start with you, Bill.
I would say a national tilt and shift to the right
in deference to the new president,
a return of Donald Trump,
and some business-oriented bills
like you just talked about with Chris the Georgia Chamber
to re-underscore Georgia's place
as a top place to do business.
How about you?
I would you describe it?
It's always a frenetic pace,
but the Sierra feels even faster than it has been in the past.
And I think Bill's right, there's a lot of emphasis on national issues
or things that people have been talking about.
There have been a lot of bills about transgender issues,
for instance, whether it's in the schools or the prisons.
There have also been some bills that really affect people,
birth to death, I like to think of it,
with IVF, Guarantee in Georgia, passing is a bipartisan bill, and that's important.
A lot of people were concerned about that publicly.
And then also on death, is this the time to talk about one of my favourites in the session?
Yeah, talk about that bill.
This was a favourite of yours?
I think so just because it came out of nowhere, and I think surprised all the lawmakers involved
a funeral director brought a bill that has, I guess it was already legal, but put some
rules around composting. It's something that composting people after we die. So that's
something that all of us, at some point, will face. And there's a new way to explain
it.
Almost ash, yeah. I was, I was taking them back, because I was thinking increasingly
people are cremated.
They are. They are.
And if they're not, I'm on the board of the monastery, the Holy Spirit. And we have
natural burial ground where you put people in hemp baskets and into the ground and I'm thinking
surely they're not going to be farming there. I just I can't make the leap.
So so talk about this a little bit. So if you said it's actually a tub they put people in and
I mean they didn't go that far into the details but yeah that's some sort of final
I was imagining a rain barrel or something you know looking like that and there there's a time
frame it's like six weeks to two months and there's a certain temperature you have to maintain
And if you do it right, it apparently there was testimony that it smells like a feed store in the facility where they do it.
And what's, I guess, compelling is that the family can have the remains back in the form of soil and
plan it in their, you know, use it in their garden to grow things.
I will say, and I'm not trying to be too cynical, the funeral home industry has been very profitable for a number of years, but that industry is shrinking.
Fewer and fewer people are going for traditional burial cemeteries, so a new revenue stream.
That was interesting.
Let's talk about you.
You mentioned one bill that was partisan, and then we've had, you know, the bipartisan
bill was IVF.
Let's talk about some more of the partisan bills.
And we will still wait.
The Statewide Doge Committee there.
Yeah.
Talk about that.
Well, it's not something the state hasn't done before and couldn't do again.
I mean, Sony Purdue, for example, when he was governor, authorized to study the state
of Georgia did not have at that time a complete inventory of all the real estate.
But the state owned, and that resulted in a lot of surplus real estate being sold, put
back into the marketplace, and also downsizing that inventory, the utility expense, et cetera.
So there's a place for this.
But obviously that's probably not the reason that we got it this year.
So we'll see what happens with that as these agencies start cutting back.
Let's talk about another part of the taxes, of course, but it was reducing the tax rate.
Not the rebates that are coming back.
The state continues to work on that.
Yeah, that's right, this year was a continuation.
I don't remember last year's cut, but this year it's,
it's income tax, so it was a 0.2% rollback.
That is 0.2 or 0.2 for last year.
Yeah, so the eventual goal is to eliminate it.
It's difficult to do because it's
about a third of the state's revenue.
Yeah, and then the other thing we were still waiting
to see what's happening with the budget.
I want to talk about that right now.
It's in conference committee because each side
has their own idea what they want in that budget and they're
and the governor is a little different to exactly the Georgia
General Assembly has to do is pass a budget now they got the
little budget pass they got a little budget pass which is
stirring up the old years budget with realities and what came
in very quickly but yeah it'll be a long night for tie yeah
it looks like it'll be a lot dealing with the part of it is
the promised scholarship or vouchers where the the houses
reduce the amount of money and the Senate wants to use
to have more?
Yeah, well, I think Governor Camp had one number,
which was kind of lower, and then the house,
I'm sorry, I'm mixing that up with the other one,
which was prisons.
Oh, yeah.
Those are the two contentious issues.
You know, there's a need for more correctional officers
and improvements in facilities.
And so I think Camp had one number, the house had another
and the Senate's kind of come in between with the number
between and they're still negotiating.
And the vouchers, the house, it was when the bill passed,
there was an assumption that it would cost about $140 million a year.
And the house set it at $40 million, I believe,
and the Senate put it back at $141 million, actually.
So we'll see where that goes.
Let's talk about what's going down in the wire.
The religious freedom bill?
Talk about that.
I do not believe it will be signed into law.
Really?
I do believe it'll pass.
It'll pass, but you don't see it doing something like
with Governor Nathan Deel, who he voted.
I don't think it'll be as dramatic as Governor Deel's
statement was, and I was talking before we started the show.
The Georgia Chamber was very vocal that time,
about the potential concerns they had,
about the religious freedom bill.
They've been very quiet this time.
So, but I also think Brian Camp, the governor,
is a very pragmatic man, and there's still some questions
about some of the verbiage and what it would be overturned.
There is a federal law already that guarantees
religious freedom, a superseding statute that passed
during the Clinton administration.
So the need is not great.
It would be a pin to the conservative base
of the Republican Party.
And I think it will pass the General Assembly.
I do not believe the Governor will sign.
Well, your thoughts, even on any other bills
down to the wire?
Well, there is a little bit of Republican resistance
against the Rift and Bill, but it was one Republican
on the last committee that passed it, who opposed it.
So there's some other bipartisan bills
that actually do affect people.
And one of them passed today, it was the,
it has to go back, but it was an election bill.
It would make some major 22-page bills.
So there's a lot of changes in there.
And I think one of the changes that people would notice
right away is you can't drop off an absentee ballot
at the weekend before an election, or you can now,
but you wouldn't, if this passes, as is.
There are a host of other changes in there,
and that was a better vote for Republicans and Democrats.
Yeah.
Okay, so we'd only have a little bit of time.
Interesting session and that what we saw today
with the Democrats was a big move walking out, right?
I understand why the GOP is made
such a series of issues around transgenderism,
but the specific bill looked one to provide gender
affirming care in Jail's mirrors of the discussion again
in the national campaign level.
And if you didn't see it, there was an ad with Vice
President Harris talking about not just providing
gender affirming care, but paying for transition
surgery for state and federal inmates
that was critical in that campaign.
We're going to have to leave it there.
I want to thank you both for coming in.
Always go so fast, because that does it today for lawmakers.
There are more committee hearings tomorrow
before signing day on Friday so we will not have a show we'll be back on Friday for one
hour lawmakers with live interviews and we'll see you then.
