You
And then what we're going to do, Chairman Hawkins has to pass in a bill at one, so Chairman
August, we're going to do you say, Representative Gamma's already presented once, and I don't think
he's going to take long.
We haven't heard your yet, but I don't think it'll take too long either.

We're okay, we're good.
All right, we have a quorum now, and I'll call the Senate Insurance and Labor Committee
to order, and we'll start with Representative Gamble House Bill 280, which we heard last
week. I think it was last week. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity
to be with you today. House Bill 280 is a bill that you might be familiar with by the
concept because we passed a bill last year that allows property and casualty insurance
to offer in the sale of a PNC policy a loss mitigation product so that could be a water
leak sensor, a smoke detector, something of small dollar type value.
And so what this bill does is it adds life insurance policies in with that so that a blood
pressure cuff or a fit bit that counts steps.
Some type of health device product like that could be offered in the sale of a life insurance
policy.
all dollar value type items that are have to be reasonable in relation to the premium.
And this is overseeing the Department of Insurance has authority over this so there is
a bad actor and keeping mind no insurance company is going to want to risk their licensure
with the state over being a bad actor in this and we have not seen that demonstrated from
the bill we passed last year. But again, this bill just adds the life insurers into being
able to offer these devices. I'm happy to answer any questions and that's, that's what
House Bill 280 does.
All right. Any questions?
Okay. I got a minute.
So I'm meant to say I'll open the floor for a motion.
We did hear that we heard this last week and there was a good bit of discussion and he's
Senator Patrick had some questions or concerns and she told me that you met and addressed
those.
We got a motion, no, have a second, second do pass.
And we're working off of LC 520188, any further discussion?
All in favor of do pass, please signify by saying aye.
Oppose, same sign.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whip Robertson is going to carry this for me.
OK.
Very good.
Thank you, Representative.
Appreciate it.
Dr. Hawkins, we'll let you come next.
I know you've got another engagement.
I do, thank you.
This is House Bill 295.
And we have not heard this bill yet.
I know a lot of work has gone into this
and I will let you tell us about it.
Thank you.
Yeah, you may remember we passed the surprise bill
in the Patient Protection Act in 2000,
signed it in the law.
What this bill did was help protect patients
from those late charges that they would see months
and months later out of getting out of the hospital
of 2040, 60,000, whatever it may be.
And the way this thing came to fruition was
through arbitration, the patient was taken out
of the discussions and the arbitration was between
the insuring and the provider.
the department, we worked closely with the department on that bill, Department of Insurance.
And since then, they have come back to me and we've had discussions on areas that they
were having problems with.
And so that's really the emphasis of this bill was addressing those.
We met in the summer and the fall with all parties, with the insurers, with the providers,
facilities, hospitals, and the Department of Insurance.
This bill addresses the things that the insurance commissioners office was having problems
with and you'll see in section one and actually just goes back and talks about the arrests
of repeat that that was in the original bill at the top of the page two it talks about
prompt pay that is already in code just sort of repeating that restating that then in
In section two, it talks about emergency services and you know that the fads require us, the facilities
and positions, whether in network or not, with emergency services, that's going to be covered.
So we just added facilities into the wording that was not in the original bill.
Section three, they were addressing some type of final payment notice.
insurers had some issues with putting final payments in certain ways. So we'll
leave that up to the department for that to be designated. That needs to be
designated because if the insurance plan is in a risk exempt plan, that goes
up the federal ladder. If it's not, then it goes up the state ladder. And as you'll
see, we have shot clocks mentioned in here. And those are a little bit
different from the federal and the state. So that's the reason they asked for
that. And again, like I said, everybody was agreeing to that. You will notice, on the
next page, we address actually the providers, some of the problems with the providers. And
if the providers are showing a practice, a pattern of continually filing for any reason
of multiplicities of filings, anything that was not in good faith, that's going to be
noted and actually later on there are fines mentioned in this bill for that. So we're addressing
evenly any problems that may be arising on each side of the fence with the insurers
or the providers. And really that's what this bill is doing. Those fines are in section
six for the providers. We have extended the shot clock. Now that was one of the main things
that the department found that was very difficult to get pass was we had 30 days in the bill
after a year and a half of actually implementing this they found that was too short of a time
for the insurers to respond to and sometimes for the providers to respond to.
So they've extended that and Mr. Chair, and that's pretty much what the bill is.
Like I said, everyone was in agreement to the wording.
wording is very narrow, but then that's what happens when you come up with a
degree-to-pond bill. Thank you for your work on this, Chairman Hawkins. Any
questions from Chairman Hawkins? We do have some folks. I don't know if you
want to spend the time to listen to them, but Commissioner's office is here
Wiston-Burlson, JC Weithington from the insurance of folks, providers that
They're all here to say yes, we agree with this.
We have come to an agreement.
I do have a sign-up sheet for people
that want to speak on the bill.
And we'll do that now.
Lauren Palo with the American Anesthesiology of Georgia.
And you can just state that you're in favor.
Yeah, we are in favor of the bill.
And we just want to say we appreciate the collaboration
between the Senate, the House, the DOI,
and the providers and insurers on this.
Thank you for the hard work.
It is a cleanup bill and it is much needed.
Thank you.
Thank you.

and it's gonna address some issues
that we're having in the meeting.
That's a prize billing,
it's gonna make the whole process smoother for everybody.
All right, thank you.
I've got a question, Senator,
or um.
No point, no point.
Oh, yeah, I was in there by the way.
second. All right, I got a motion do pass. Let's see. Motion do pass LC 460544. That's what
you got right and a second from Senator Harveston. Any further discussion? Yes, sir.
It is a little shocking but we needed to come by a moment. There's going to be a
Marshmallow roast later. All right any further discussion. All those in favor of
Dupass SB I mean House Bill 295. Say aye. Oppose same sign. All right thank you.
Thank you.
Senator Hofsteadler.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Reconciliation.
All right.
All right.
Next, House Bill 63.
Representative Noe Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Bill 63 is LC number 520174.
This bill actually is for fully insured health insurance groups that have 20 or more covered
lives or covered employees, we're simply asking for claims experience at renewal time from
the insurance companies to the insured or to the group.
That's all this bill does right now.
If your level funded or self-funded, you get claims experience from three and above and
If you're fully insured right now,
you get claims experience for a hundred and above.
But we have a lot of groups out there that are between 20 and 99.
And this gives employers the claims experience.
It gives the insurance brokers the claims experience.
So when they're shopping, you know,
it kind of gives everyone an equal playing field.
So the insurance companies know exactly
what's going on with the risk.
All right.
So just to be sure it's sinking in, I guess,
Because you know, I've talked about this numerous times it took me a minute to fully grasp the benefit of this as
And you're a broker yourself correct correct, and so you've spec- you specialize in employee benefits and
This bill like when you go to a small business owner you want to be able to offer them
Every option that might benefit them as far as the benefit package correct
This is another tool for them to look at because they ask you, OK, why are my rates going
up and you say, well, your loss ratio, OK, what did I have, you know, can you prove it
to me?
And then so you had to take the word from the insurance carrier that gave you the information.
But if I had claims experience and say, well, you had six people that had this, this,
this, and this.
And there's no HIPAA violation because, you know, as the broker or as the HR director,
you know, you sign off for HIPAA and the names are not on there, it is just saying what
the condition is and what the prognosis is and diagnosis so you can plan going forward.
And it's equal footing for the insurance carriers is good for the employer groups and it's
good for the employees because they don't have to fill out all this paperwork and answer
applications and I mean they don't know what their kids medicine are taking.
But you know if you have that information for the insurance carrier and they have that
information.
So as a broker, without the information on the smaller groups, under 100, you may not
be able to offer that business owner for their employees a level-funded option or a correct
or a self-insured option.
Whereas with this, you have more options available.
That is correct.
It's great isn't it like I said it just puts everybody on the equal play and feel all right. I have a question from Senator Robertson
Chairman Robertson would you try Mike too?
Better yes, okay. I'm not an insurance broker. I'm a consumer and I just want to be clear
The information you're providing them, and what was the terminology I think you used?
Claims information.
Well, you didn't say claims information, it was another word phrase, I thought, but so
this information is it just the amount of claims that have been paid out?
No, it would be like for instance, if you had an employee that was a diabetic condition
and then they had $60,000 in claims
and they were taking this type of insulin.
You know, that would be disclosed
so they could see why their rates were going up.
Or if you had a pregnancy,
well, that pregnancy was over,
so you could argue with the insurance company,
hey, we're not gonna have these claims again.
You've got to give me better rates going forward
on this group at the renewal time.
So I came from a government that was self-insured
and they're getting this information.
No, no, that's the thing.
The third party provider would come in and they would say,
well, we have one consolidated government employee
that consumed $500,000 with the claims last year
because of cancer, diabetes, or medicine or medication.
So what you're saying is, in terms of companies
would be required to provide this information to you.
So when you spoke to your customer who are under the numbers
that you're talking about now, you would have these numbers
articulate to the customers to why their insurance was going up and right now
you just right now all I have is you pay this in claims or this
in premium and these are what your claims were and unless we fill out
questionnaires all the employees filling out questionnaires we're not going to
know what's going on with that group and a lot of times these employees they
don't know the medications they're taking or the kids are taking or their
spouses are taking unless it's something you know really you know really big
Okay, but it just it just a level play and feel for everybody. I just don't want to vote for something
I don't understand and now I understand. Right. Thank you for the question.
Senator Kazer, thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the second page line 26, you had another change
for insurers that utilize provider contracting methods that goes on and says, or other methods used
to calculate premiums. What are you targeting this?
That's a good question. A lot of times that renewal, your
census might have changed. The male, female factor.
The age change, you might have added some new people.
You might have brought in some kids on the group.
So when they're looking at the renewal piece,
they take that all into consideration, not only
the claims data, but what the next 12 months,
what their forecast is going to be.
Also, there might have been something that was just diagnosed and it has not shown up yet in claims and they use that information going forward for a rating model.
There might be somebody that they know of that had some some cancer information or some funny medical and it's about to hit and they know that's going to take place in the next 12 months, so that gives insurance carrier the option to weigh that in their claims data.
And this was model legislation from other states that have picked this up.
So it was national association of insurance commissioners model legislation.
Follow up real quick.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm afraid this is going to hurt the consumer.
Man, that's going to let them raise your rights, basically, by predicting the claims.
They're going to be worse.
They're doing that right now.
But if you can go to the group and tell them what's going on with their group,
they might can change their plan design or they might be putting some
and send us some different wellness programs if they know they have a bunch of
diabetics on their health plan.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yes sir.
If I can speak to Chairman Couser on that and Chairman that was the exact
problem we were running into until we started getting this information where
when we realized a disproportionate amount of our insurance was being used for
of those who experienced diabetic issues,
we were able to establish another tool
that would home deliver the services
to our diabetic employees within the Columbus
because all of the government,
so they could get ahead of their issue
before it became a bigger problem
and impacted the premiums of the 2000 employees
that were on there.
So without this information,
our rates would have continued to go high
without us understanding that there were solutions
that we could adopt and go into that.
So this information helped us a lot in the phrase
I was looking for this claims experience.
So thank you.
Mr. Protein, do you have a question?
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman, this seems to make a lot of sense to me.
My question is, is there anyone that's against the bill
that you know of?
Not that I'm aware of.
Great, thank you.
One of the insurance carriers was a little hesitant,
but when I talked to them,
I'm like you're providing this information
your level funded piece was the issue and they said well it might put more work on us that's
it okay imagine that all right okay we do we had a sign up she nobody signed up so that the
time it's good time if you'd like to make that motion thank you mr. Chairman like to make a
a motion do pass. All right. Have a motion on the second any further discussion. All those
in favor please say aye. Opposed like sign. All right. Passed.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is carrying this me. Yes, sir. All right.
right. I'm glad we got a robust explanation. That'll help me. Thank you. All right, next
I'm representing my thigh, House Bill 362, Matthew Ack, sorry.
I appreciate you for sticking out for it.
Thank you.
Would it be all right if I bring my council to?
Yes, that's fine.
House Bill 362, LC 520244.
Yes sir. We went through subcommittee I think a couple weeks ago if I'm not
mistaken. What this bill does is provide for all providers a transparency that
will benefit providers or the insurers that will provide the treating
provider upon written requests the accounting of the payments of the
health care provider service. Often the checks are written to the patient or the
policy holder and then assigned to an attorney. The health care provider is not
always aware of the amount that's paid on their belt until the end of the
year. When the provider gets at 1099 and the amount of the that's been paid by
the insurer may be different than what is being dispersed through the
attorney or what the patient has been paid. So basically that's what this does.
It simply allows the provider or the doctor to know exactly what's being
paid on their bills.
All right. And so this did go through Chairman Kirkpatrick subcommittee.
Yes sir. Would you like to comment on that or do you all have a recommendation on
the bill. I don't think anybody has any issues with the bill.
Chairman Kirkpatrick, you did talk about Worker's Comp a little bit that day if you recall.
And on line 93, the obligations provided in Code Section 34-9-11.1 is where that Worker's
was. Mr. Chairman, the issue was just making sure that this didn't interfere with anybody's
subrogation rights under workers' comp.
Okay. Mr. Alvary, introduce yourself.
I'm Alvary Galant who's the Georgia Chiropractic Association in line 92 and 93 basically says
that the rights of subrogation under workers' comp are not interfered with. And I'll answer
any questions you have otherwise I'll just wave my testimony.
All right I do our learned attorneys on the committee you all may have some experience
with this and your practice you see any no questions all right what's what's the will of
committee. We've got a motion to pass and a second. Any further discussion? I'm
going to change up this time. All in favor raise your hand because some people
have their mouth off of it or any. All right. Good luck in rules. Thank you. Thank
That might be a little segue to thank our sponsors for the nice, deli lunch we had provided.
We are clearly enjoying that and we appreciate it very much and it was a pretty long list
of sponsors just about every insurance advocate in the room helped by our lunch so thank
you all very much. Yes, ma'am. If you weren't able to participate, I think she won't
submit. Is anybody willing to carry that bill on the floor? I can, but I've got a good
many. Anybody have an interest in carrying that?
I'll give you my nose.
All right, I'll take care of it.
Thank you. Senator Merritt.
Senator Merritt will handle it.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
She's very good in the well.
I've already passed a few bills this session, haven't you?
Thank you.
So if you didn't get a chance to participate with sponsor and launch,
we'll have another opportunity.
I'm sure down the road.
All right, next, House Bill 315, Representative Taylor.
And I don't think we've heard this one.
Is this in subcommittee?
Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
I bring you House Bill 315 and I'm working off of LC 520242.
This actually is a bill we worked on last year and it came through.
It passed so that insurance companies would recognize a second mammogram when it's due
to the high definition was needed.
They were sometimes writing those as not preventive and making them subject to deductibles
and copay and they should not be.
When we wrote the bill last year, it said we were using a set particular guideline, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network as of January 1st, 2022.
And it came to light that we need to leave that up to the insurance commissioners because
there's new books and regulations just about every year.
So we've changed that to allow the insurance commissioner who oversees these type of things
to say which guidebook we'll use, and that's basically what it does, it's a simple little
bill.
Okay, any questions, Senator Roberts?
No questions.
Mr. Chairman, at the right time, I do recall this legislation last year.
It's good legislation.
Okay.
All right. I have a motion do pass in a second. Senator Merritt any further discussion?
All in favor of do pass raise your hand. Any opposed? Senator Lucas a
Affirmative on this one all right pass unanimous and
thank you thank you thank you
all right moving quickly here representative Henderson House Bill 384
glad you were able to be with us today and we heard this last week but I'm not sure
sure the same people were here so give us a quick synopsis of of your bill.
Yes so thank you chair and committee. HV 384 is for prostate cancer. Prostate
cancer is one of the leading cause of death for men in the state of Georgia. This
share alone 9,300 men will be diagnosed and over 900 will lose their
battle to prostate cancer. This bill simply urges men to have a PSA test done
yearly and to avoid having prostate cancer. The PSA test is a simple blood test
that men can receive. prostate cancer does not come with any pain or any
warnings, if you do have pain, then of course it's too late, it's already spread.
So therefore, this bill simply has the insurance company sends notifications to men upon
reaching age 45 to recommend that men have a PSA test done yearly.
So this is pretty much an eye opener and a red flag raised for men to save lives.
detection is key early detection save lives.
All right. Thank you. And we heard testimony last week that these notices or reminders or
notifications can be delivered electronically.
Yes, sir.
That's correct.
And I don't, there wasn't anybody last week that spoke for or against this. I don't
see anybody signed up today. You're not aware of any opposition to this. Are you
No, sir, it passed unanimously in the House.
I haven't heard any opposition.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
Any further discussion?
All in favor, please raise your hand.
So the motion do pass.
Senator Lucas seconds.
Senator Robertson.
And pass unanimously.
Thank you.
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you, Chair.
All right.
Well, that concludes our business.
I don't think we're going to meet again this session.
Appreciate y'all's work on the committee and we stand adjourned.
