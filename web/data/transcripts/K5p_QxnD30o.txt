TRANSCRIPT
----------
I want to thank everybody for coming today.
Quite simply, Georgia is facing a health care crisis,
and the Republicans will not act to help Georgia's families.
The picture is bleak, and it is widely
held that Georgia's health care system is failing.
It would only get worse with the expiration
of the federal ACA subsidies.
Because of new federal laws in our state and action,
over the next year, almost 500,000
Georgians could lose health care.
Over the next decade, we could lose over 33,000 jobs,
and billions lost in healthcare revenue
and additional billions in uncomplicated care.
Yet Georgia Republicans refused to act.
In fact, they marched blindly and willingly off of this cliff.
But the numbers do not tell the personal story
that so many of our Georgia families are actually facing.
Many Georgians will see their insurance premiums
double or even triple.
When we talk about job loss,
that means people's ability to take care of their families
is lost.
This is not about politics to these people.
It is about survival.
You know, when people go to the polls and they elect us,
they elect us to try to help solve their problems.
When people of this state voted for President Trump
and Republicans, they were trusting that they were
to address issues impacting their families
and especially the health care affordability crisis.
Yet the president instead of addressing
the affordability crisis says that the use of the term
is actually a con job.
You see, the Republicans to them affordability
is simply a political buzz word, but to Democrats,
we understand that is a term that properly encompasses
folks' concern about rising health care costs,
education costs, and even housing costs.
Fortibility is not a con job.
The con job is the one that's been laid
on the people of Georgia by the Republicans
that they would promise to do something about these issues.
Not only do Republicans refuse to act,
they actively ignore legislation that will bring solutions
to these problems.
Concerning this health crisis,
Democrats led by former Senator Jason Estevez
introduced SB192.
Because this caucus realized the very possibility
that President Trump and Congress,
and the name of politics,
would refuse to help people
and allow the subsidies to expire.
Senator Estevez, along with this caucus,
is providing solutions to help the people of the state.
And so SB192 was one of those solutions.
Make no mistake over the next few months in these hallways.
And around this state, we're going to be laser focused
on showing the people of this state which parties
about finding solutions and which parties about politics.
And one of the leaders of our state
who will help us find solutions, as he did with SB 192,
is Senator Jason S. Tess.
With that, I'll give it to Senator Jason S. Tess.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Leader, and thank you to the Gregory as well, introduced in a second
for being here this morning, and to my former colleagues in the State Senate.
Thank you for continuing to fight to protect and expand access to health care in this
state.
My name is Jason Estevez, and I am proud to be working across this state to change leadership,
as Georgians deserve better than the leadership
that we are seeing here today.
As a former educator, as someone who's
on the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education,
as a former state senator, but more importantly,
as the husband of a wife who's a nurse practitioner
and owns an urgent care in Metro Atlanta,
I've seen the impacts of this failure in leadership firsthand.
I've seen what happens when Republicans refuse to act
on expanding access to health care,
and what that means for families across the state.
And now in just a few weeks,
millions of Georgians are on the verge
of either losing access to the health insurance
that they need or seeing their premiums skyrocket.
Premiums that were already unaffordable.
Why is that?
Because Donald Trump and his cheerleaders have failed to act
and extend the subsidies that so many people rely on.
Over 1.5 million Georgians benefit from those subsidies today
and they are at risk of losing it
because of the failure of Republicans act.
So let's talk about what that exactly means.
That means that parents who are gonna be unable
to get health insurance,
even though they're working two to three jobs
each just to stay afloat.
It means families are forced to choose between
life-saving medical care and putting food
on the table or roof over their head.
In a state where 15 to 20% of Georgians
have billions of dollars in medical debt already,
folks can't afford to lose their health insurance.
Not only that, small business owners like my wife and I
are going to be unable to pay for their employee's health
insurance.
We knew that this crisis would happen long before today.
That's why I authored SB192, the Georgia Health Insurance
of Fortability and Consumer Protection Act.
This legislation would fill in the gaps and coverage
when federal benefits expire at the end of the month.
It ensures that we protect Georgia's health care
in the face of a chaos coming out of Washington DC.
My colleagues and I brought this necessary legislation
to the Senate floor, but Republicans,
like Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones
and others refused to pass it.
Brian Kemp refused to show leadership
and get his allies on board with protecting health care.
And now, as health insurance is being ripped away
from millions of Georgians,
the governor and his allies are still sitting on their hands.
Bert Jones, Brad Raffisberger, and Chris Carr
have even cheered on this destruction
coming out of Trump's White House and Republicans
in Congress.
So let me be clear, we are in crisis.
And in times of crisis, we run towards that fight.
And because we are in crisis, we're
going to step up when we are in leadership.
We're going to do what we should have done over a decade ago
and expand access to Medicaid.
But we won't stop there.
We're also going to lower the cost of private health
insurance and make that more affordable by lowering the health insurance premiums and
building health care hubs throughout this state.
We'll make sure to make it easier for Georgians to get the care they need, not harder.
You can count on me, you can count on Senate Democrats to use every tool in our toolbox
to help the people of this state get the services that they need.
And there's no excuse for Republicans failures.
And it's time to act now.
So we are calling on Brian Kemp and state Republican leaders to protect health care now,
pass SB 192 next session, and use the state's resources over $14.9 billion sitting in a bank
account to ensure that Georgians aren't left out in the cold.
We want to make sure that every Georgian who is looking at December 31st with fear and
worry to know that Senate Democrats stand with you, that we stand with you, and that I
stand with you.
And here's my commitment to you.
I will always put your health first.
That's what I've done my entire career, and it's what I'll continue to do as a leader
in the state.
No matter what attacks Trump and Republicans throw away, we'll fight for you.
Now I'd like to introduce Kiana Randi, Kiana Randi Gregory, and their mother, Marilyn.
Marilyn and Randi Gregory will be speaking to discuss how their families are being impacted
by the lack of leadership Republicans have shown and by the expiring healthcare subsidies
in the state.
Hi, thank you for being here today. My name is Randy Gregory, and I'm here because what's
happening with health care right now is personal, not just for me, but for so many people
in our state. Several months ago, I lost my job, and let me tell you nothing prepares
you for how fast life can change. One day, I had employer insurance, and the next I
essentially rely on Medicaid just as they covered. I'm truly grateful it was
there because it kept me from going completely uninsured while I try to get
back on my feet and started freelancing.
Thank you. However, trying to figure out which doctors take my plan, waiting
forever for approvals, feeling like I'm doing paperwork every day is very
exhausting. Not to mention demoralizing every time we hear someone say sorry
are you, we don't take Medicaid.
Well, you're already stressed
now that getting healthcare
shouldn't feel like another full-time job.
I recently got the notice that the plan I qualify for
is jumping to over $150 a month
after previously being $0, aka free.
I'm making money again, but nowhere near what I earned before.
That price increase might not sound huge to some people,
but for me and for so many others,
trying to stay afloat is the difference
between stability and spiraling.
It was really scary and I know I'm not the only person
who was thinking how are we gonna do this.
These subsidies help healthcare within reach
for everyday people and losing them means thousand of us
are about to see premium jumping away.
We simply cannot afford.
So I'm asking our leaders to please not let this happen.
Don't let people be priced out of something
as basic and essential as healthcare.
Lower the cost, fix the system so it actually works
when we need it, make it so that getting care
doesn't feel like fighting through obstacles
every step of the way.
We deserve healthcare that is affordable and accessible.
We deserve a system that helps people stay healthy
instead of getting pushed deeper into stress and debt.
And we just simply deserve better.
And that is why I'm so happy to be supporting
for my Senator Jason Estevez and his renter governor.
Thank you.
Hello.
Good afternoon, and thank you for allowing me
this moment to speak. My name is Marilyn Gregory, I'm 61 years old, and I work hard. And
like so many Americans, I live on a modest income. I've been planning for my future at
working towards purchase in a home next year, and that's what kept me focused and hopeful
and determined. But hope shook just a little bit when I opened that letter, and it said
that my insurance premium was going from $86 a month to $522 a month.
My heart skipped a beat, y'all, because let's be honest, no matter how hard you budget,
no matter how careful you are, there's just no room for $436 increase.
Not with rent, utilities, groceries, and certainly not with a new mortgage on the horizon.
And the weight of it isn't just financial, it's medical.
I have appointments I've waited months for, for neurologists and a room, room of towel
this next year.
And changing insurances could mean new doctors, new referrals, and starting the whole process
over again.
That means more time waiting for answers, more time living with uncertainty about what's
going on with my health.
Time matters, especially when it comes to our health.
And I know I'm not alone.
There are thousands, millions of people who are living paycheck to paycheck doing everything
right and still being asked to choose between their health and their stability.
I spoke to another Georgian who's 60 years old who had to have emergency surgery this year.
Her insurance is going, she makes $45,000 a year.
Her insurance is going from $286 a month to over $700 a month.
No one should have to choose between paying for insurance and keeping a roof over their head.
No one should have to choose between seeing a specialist and buying insurance.
And that's why I'm here today to say I support former Senator Jason Estevez and his run for
governor.
Thank you.
Thank you to any questions.
What do you expect the whole change this next year as a live play session that's under
the way it comes to the field?
Can you talk to your colleagues on the other side of the pile in the patient that you
can have bipartisan support for that?
I think what's really happening is there's a hope that the ACC subsidies won't not expire.
But it doesn't look like that, so I want to take place.
It looks like they will expire.
And so I think at that point in time a real conversation has to take place.
That conversation should already happen quite frankly.
And this bill particularly just sat there.
And anyone who could kind of read the tea leaves over the summer and also even during a legislative session
could see what we were kind of heading that these ACA subsidies were most likely going to be allowed to expire.
And when we're in our positions to do these things to actually make decisions for people,
that's when we should have came together and said, okay, we have a piece of legislation.
It could have been somebody else could have drafted a legislation.
But we have legislation.
Let's try to act on this because we see which way
the federal government is actually going.
And that's the key.
When you're actually tied to the federal government
in this situation as we are, you have to look at that
and say, we've got to make sure the people of Georgia
are actually protected.
And that's what's going to happen.
So we're going to continue to push this particular issue.
If the subsidies are allowed to expire,
this bill is going to be still pending as we know.
Another member of our caucus will pick that bill up
and really fight for it.
And at that point in time,
We know we have to have bipartisan support.
We can't pass anything without Republican help,
quite frankly.
So we know that has to take place.
That's already a given.
The question is, are they going to be willing
to actually come to the table and say,
we're going to do right for the Georgia's families?
Are we going to continue to just pay politics?
Because I think it's important to note
that the governor has touted the fact
that 1.6 million Georgians are now ensured
because of his health policies.
1.5 million of those 1.6 are insured under Georgia access,
which is the Affordable Care Act.
So with these expiring health subsidies,
what that's going to mean is that close to a million people
are going to find their premium skyrocket,
and the Kaiser Family Foundation believes
that more than half of those folks are going to get dropped
from coverage because they won't be able to afford it.
So under Republican leadership,
under this governor, we're going to go from having 1.6 million
Georgians insured through access to pathways of coverage
and through Georgia access.
And we're going to go to maybe having around 500,000 Georgians
insured.
That's close to 2 million Georgians being uninsured
because of the failures, not only of what's
happening in Washington, DC, but the fact
that Georgia Republicans are sitting on their hands
with something, as the leader said,
should have been discussed and acted on a long time ago.
There's no reason that we could not have acted
on this legislation this year,
but they don't wanna do it
because they don't wanna embarrass Republicans in Washington
and as a result,
Georgians in this state are gonna be suffering.
We need leadership to step up
and do something about it now.
Yeah, I mean, I certainly think that would be one of the ways we could find funding for
this when I think since as the best talked about $14 billion in surplus and we're talking
about you've heard the personal stories here.
Some of these families are going to be suffering through this.
We have to try to find an avenue to make sure we bridge this gap that's going to exist.
And this is one of those issues that is obvious.
There's no doubt what is going to happen if these subsidies are allowed to expire.
Everyone agrees on that.
There's no doubt about that.
There's a consensus with that.
Therefore, the only reason not to actually pursue this bill or similar legislation would
be just politics.
And that's former Senator Esfet says it's just to protect those up in Washington.
That's the only other reason.
Sometimes you can have legislation where you say, well, maybe this will happen or maybe
that will happen.
In this particular situation, no one really doubts exactly what will take place.
You just heard from families talking about their previously gone up.
We know that is exactly what is going to take place.
When you have that information, you have to act.
And a refusal to act is basically just paying partisan politics.
So, the answer to both your questions, one, uh, you, uh, you, you, you, you, you, you,
So the answer to both your questions, one, the Governor can still act using executive
action to make sure that we get people covered under plans that are more affordable.
And to your point, price increases have already been filed with departments all across
the country, so there's a lot of support that would be needed.
Georgia has the tools that it needs to make sure, especially those who are covered through
Georgia access, to make sure that those insurance premiums are subsidized.
It just takes the governor and legislative leaders stepping up to the plate and making sure
that Jordan's get covered.
Behind the scenes, Republicans know that health care is in crisis in this state.
They know that we should have expanded Medicaid over a decade ago.
They know that Georgia access needs a lot more support.
They also know that pathways the coverage has been a complete failure by spending $100 million
on a plan that covers less than 10,000 people in this state.
And they also know that we have to do something about all of those things.
So what we need are leaders that are going to step up and actually get something done
by putting Georgians first and ignoring,
and not getting distracted by what's happening
in Washington, D.C.
Yeah.
The fiscal note has not been prepared for this bill.
No.
You've filed a bill in a few minutes.
Well, this bill in particular would have started
with a pilot program, so it would have been very limited,
and would have cost under $100 million.
We didn't, we didn't do a fiscal note, it was just an estimate, yeah.
So part of the legislation, now I want to get back to one of your questions too, get
back to your questions too.
Number one, when you're asking about the already closing, it's the subsidies, which means
you actually can help people even if they're actually as close, that's what the government
would actually be doing.
Then secondly, as far as behind the scenes,
let's say you even talk about in front of the scenes,
this bill didn't even get a hearing actually.
And that is very important.
So not only behind the scenes, we not really heard,
but also openly it did not even get a hearing.
And so also part of this particular legislation
made note, please, part of this legislation
was that we would actually look at this legislation
from a fiscal standpoint, but it had to get passed first.
but I do think the initial estimate about $100 million,
which would help as far as being a subsidy is concerned,
to actually lower costs, that's gonna be the key thing.
Because it's a subsidy, so you're actually helping
somebody as far as the premium may go up,
but you're actually helping them actually be able
to pay that, that's the key thing, so.
But I think the key is, when a bill like this
doesn't even get a meaningful hearing,
I think that is extremely key.
Yeah, and just to be clear, the program did not cost,
or was not estimated cost $100 million.
It was gonna be much less than that.
The key about this program across the country,
there are states that have already implemented direct
subsidy programs through the Affordable Care Act.
And the goal there is to supplement
what's happening with the federal subsidies
and provide direct subsidies to citizens of the state.
So to give you an example, if the premium was $150,
the state would subsidize a hundred of those dollars
for over the course of the year, that's $1,200, right?
So just to give you an idea of how much that would be
for each resident, and then when you talk about
administrative costs on top of that.
So it's much less complicated than, for example,
expanding Medicaid and having to deal with that
kind of administrative burden.
Any others?
Thank you so much for coming out.
Thank you.
You
