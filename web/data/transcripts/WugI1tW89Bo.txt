Although most of us didn't leave, but today is legislative day 13. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 164th House District, the chairman of the Economic Development and Tourism Committee, Chairman Ron Stevens. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House today, I have waited almost two and a half decades to have the pastor of the day. I have the opportunity, but it's got to be that right person. Well, today is my brother-in-law. But before I introduce you to him, would you please give a good house welcome to my sister and her son, Matt Sarah. Would you stand? 1974, Bill and Sarah were in my Sunday school class. We taught whenever the wife and I first got married. And he's turned out to be a pretty amazing guy. Thank you all for the prayers this year, this past week. It's felt dearly, but my pastor and my good friend, my brother-in-law, Bill Black. Good morning. Hope you all had a good time off as chairman Rossin said, you all been busy. But here I'm here today and I thank God for being here today. I'm not used to reading a sheet, so you probably won't see me read a sheet today. I always come from the heart, so I will read a little bit of it. But I won't be like one pastor I know one time. His wife always laid out his clothes and always laid out two pieces of candy for him every Sunday morning. And that Sunday morning he got dressed and went to church and all of a sudden his wife on the front row down there kept doing this. Cut it off. And finally after hour and a half he quit. And they went and left and she said, why did you preach so long? He said, well, I always take that one piece of candy and put it in my mouth when it dissolves. I quit. And I always take the other piece of candy after service and I put it in my mouth and greet everybody. But the first piece of candy never stopped. And she says, oh my Lord, you got my earrings. So guys, don't wear your Y-Series in your mouth. I'm honored to be here today in front of Speaker Rossin and each Georgia representative today. And I feel like I'm Moses sometimes that I'm not able to speak to you because in the scripture it says that Moses said, oh Lord, I'm not eloquent. Neither before nor since. You have spoken to your servant but I am slow to speak and slow in tone. Just like Moses God said, how can who made this man's mouth? And God says I did. And he says, now therefore go and I will be with you, with your mouth and I will teach you what to say. And that comes in Exodus chapter 4 verses 10 through 12. Each day is Christians, each one of us and you two today, we come into a challenge. Every day is a challenge in our life. The first challenge of the day is even just to get up this morning and come here to do your job. Just like my challenge every day, every day is a challenge and some of the days are difficult. I'll never say that your job is easy and you probably say I've never done my job is easy but each one of us has a job to do. So in that do our lives change. Do we say, well we do this today and tomorrow we do something else? Let me tell you this morning as Christians our job never changes because our job is constant. Our job is to do what God's called us to do and that is to represent either the state of Georgia but the most important job is to honor God and everything that we do. Whether it's to preach or it's to honor to state of Georgia or to honor our families or whatever it may be. Our life is short. We're not here very long. Even if we live 100 years, it's not long. And I know in our lifetime 100 years seem like a long time but the older I get it seems like it's not long at all. Because you know what? We're here today and we're going tomorrow. And then someone else, I sit there in your place and someone else will make those decisions. But in our life I remember what the Apostle Paul our Peter said in Acts chapter 5 verse 29, that we ought to obey God rather than men. And that's the challenge. Each day we have a challenge where that answer the questions that people ask us. Because sometimes you ask difficult questions. Sometimes in my life I'm asked difficult questions. And in that life do I tell them the truth or I just tell them a lie. Or do I tell them what God says and go by a teacher and go around it. Each one of us must make that decision. And why do we make that decision? As my brother-in-law just said, Ron, last week was a difficult time for us. My mother-in-law passed away and she was not my mother-in-law. She was my second mother. And then that difficult time came. I had to reflect on some things. Because as you hear today and we're honored to be with you today, I am. I'm so honored to be here today. But last week I had a chance to honor my mother, my second mother. See as a pastor sometimes it's difficult to stem before people telling about someone. I've been honored in my life. I got to honor my mother at her funeral. I've done it. I've done my mother-in-law funeral last week. And I couldn't do without God being in my life. But let me tell you this this morning. There's one thing that she always said to us. And I hope you take this to heart this morning if you don't get anything else is integrity. Integrity is something that guess what? When you lose it, it's gone. And it's not coming back. No matter how hard you try, your integrity will never come back. There will be people that's doubting you and your decisions. But if you keep your integrity and part of that integrity is your name. As you vote and make the decision for the state of Georgia, you make that decision. But behind that decision is your name. Because in the Bible, Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 1 says, A good name is better than precious ointment. He said it's better than anything in this world, your name. And that is so important. So integrity, she was a woman of integrity. And I thank God for her being in my life. And I hope this morning that that word integrity will ring out in your heart. You see just like me, as I pastor church called Rocky Creek Baptist Church, one day, guess what? I gotta stand before my God and I gotta give an account. You don't for that, but I do. Every word I speak before that congregation, I've gotta give an account. But let me tell you this this morning, every word you say, you'll give an account one day. And it's not your mother and father you standing before, you standing before God. And he's a mighty God. He's a loving God. So I thank you for allowing me to be here today. But I have one thing to lighten your heart this morning, I hope. As a Baptist minister, let me tell you this, a Southern Baptist minister, one morning, he came there to preach a sermon and the sermon was about worms. That's a good sermon, isn't it? So he wanna do an illustration. So he got four jars to do the illustration. And in those four jars, the first jar was an jar of alcohol. The second jar was in a jar with cigarette smoke in it. The third jar was in a jar that guess what was full of chocolate syrup. Oh, I heard some alls out there. Just ruined the syrup, didn't it? And then the last jar was in a jar with nothing but good soil in it. So after he had preached and he gave him the example and he said this, he said, guess what? Number one, the jar with the worm in alcohol is dead. The jar with a cigarette smoke, the worm's dead. With the jar with the chocolate syrup in it, hate to say this, he was dead too. But the jar with the clean soil was, he was alive. So as he was going out, he asked one of his pres, presisters and he said this, did you get the message this morning and the person said the, the lady said this, I got it. As long as you drink and you smoke and eat chocolate, you won't have worms. As long as you keep doing what God's calling you to do and do what he says, you being good soil. Let's pray this morning. Father God, we thank You, Lord, for He's represented here today. We thank You, Speaker, Ross and Lord, may You bless, Timothy Leeds. God, we thank You for our governor today. May You bless him with understanding and wisdom and knowledge. And God, as we go through this 2020 year, we just pray, Lord, You will just help him each and everyone in the way that they should go to lead this state. God, this is an awesome state. And we thank You that we live in the state of Georgia, Father. And we ask You now, Lord, to help us and all that we do and say, God, I know they got tough decisions to make in a few days ahead. And God, I pray that You put Your loving arms around them and help them. And we thank You in love for all You done for us. And we pray this in the precious name of Jesus, amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which He stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Lord. God bless you. Thank You, Lord. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on the United States.

The chair is going to ask members to limit their remarks to not more than one minute. And that will be enforced strictly. Chair recognizes, Chairman David Knight for a morning order. Good morning. For a long time we as a state and nation have talked about a government takeover of health care. It's an important topic and a very divisive topic. And it will no doubt continue. And what I want to talk to you about today is a corporate takeover of health care. It has been going on for some time. It's a serious issue and happily I think it will prove less divisive and even bipartisan. George has been sending hundreds of millions of dollars, health care dollars and a huge portion of our health care decisions to Wall Street to these publicly traded companies. These companies have been posting astronomical profits ultimately paid by the most vulnerable citizens in Georgia taxpayer dollars. Wall Street now decides what medications we can access and how we get them and how much we pay for them.

For so, the patients have been cut out of the loop. It's dangerous and we're going to put it into it. I want to thank all of y'all last year, this almost unanimously, with exception of one vote, passed HB233. If you remember, that stopped the pvm-on pharmacies from poaching patient information and steering to their affiliated companies. Today, in fact, right now, today, we're going to introduce three pieces of legislation. It's going to bring true transparency to prescription jogue market, while at the same time closing loopholes and the existing laws that manage cure organizations, pvms, and even the state contracted pvms used to continue to engage in practices harmful to patients. We'll also be seeking a carve out of prescription drug benefits from Medicaid managed care. West Virginia did it, and an actual wearl study actually showed that it saved over $50 million. Again, I want to thank all of you for what you've done in the past. These bills will be dropped today. I hope, like in the past, all of you will come on and sign on to these bills as we deal with this massive health care problem in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes represented to Bentley for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is raised to age day in Georgia. Then there's a sheet on your desk relating to that. There's advocates across the Capitol today to discuss that. So please visit it with those advocates. All individuals that are affiliated with Fort Valley State University, I ask that you please join me and colleagues. I ask that you please join us as we pray for the safe return of Anita Yagan. Anita Yagan is a student at Fort Valley State University, senior majoring in agriculture. And she has been missing colleagues since February 14th. And we just are praying for her safe return back home to her family and her Fort Valley State University family. And we are so very grateful to the Peach County Sheriff Department, the Fort Valley Police Department, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia State Patrol in all volunteers that are out right now searching for Anita Yagan. And we just prayed to the Lord that she's return back home safe and sound with no injuries. Thank you in the name of Jesus. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Paris for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. Today I will be giving you your black moment, your moment in black history.

I think it feels like a lot of times you get a lot of negative, and so we're going to just have one big dose of positive. I have a patient that last year was seven years old and had autism and would ask for food by dragon his dad to the kitchen by the hand, because he didn't have enough language to be able to say that he was hungry. He wasn't potty trained. He couldn't identify any animals or shapes. He couldn't answer a yes or no question. And then this body passed legislation so that ABA therapy was covered by four Medicaid recipients. And nine months after starting ABA therapy, he walked through a room I was in in my ABA clinic as I was cleaning up and said, hi, Dr. Zina, which is impressive to begin with. And then he said, I want a cucumber. I want a cucumber, please. Ooh, radish. We just had salad. And this little boy is now potty trained. He is doing math on grade level. He is learning how to read. He can tell you about 30 different dinosaurs, but he can answer questions. And he can communicate effectively enough to have his basic needs met. And he was completely unable to do that before ABA therapy. And that is thanks to y'all. So his family and many other families who have benefited from that legislation. Thank you. And so do I.
