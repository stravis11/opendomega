you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you me you a As I'm sure everyone in the room is where we just finish a special session here at the Capitol and all of those senators and house members have to get back to their district and make up for all the missed constituent meetings and issues that built up while we were up here doing the people's work during the special session. Now we will I'll ask Chairman Albers if he would do me the favor of offering up a prayer before we get started. 6 Be my pleasure please bow your heads Lord we thank you for this day we thank you for this opportunity to work together to serve people to help people to do what you call this to do which is lay down the things around us all gods children working together to benefit one another whoever is asked you bless these meetings and the work ahead and your most holy name we pray amen you want to remind everybody something I said when we first started this um at the first meeting we're here to look at the the Fulton County jail and that's that's very clear we're here to look at the Fulton County jail I didn't say we're here to look at the Sheriff's Office we're here to look at the county commission we're here to look at the uh disc attorney's office or or the judiciary those are four very important pillars that impact the Fulton County jail that is owned by the citizens of Fulton County. I will not allow myself or this committee to be distracted by anyone's personal goals uh anyone's personal politics I have been raised throughout my adult life as a law enforcement officer and I appreciate the integrity of an investigation and an investigation means that you do not get distracted you do not get in a hurry you take your time you be patient and you thoroughly vet all the information we started this subcommittee last month with a meeting to come in and educate individuals on what a jail is and I will tell you I've done research nationwide and I can fill this room with books written about prisons I can't fill this desk with books written about jails because not only do the citizens of Fulton County the citizens of Georgia not understand what a jail is but most people in the United States of America do not understand exactly what a jail is and what goes into a jail what comes out of a jail and what happens inside of a jail and so that's what we're here to do and the people that impact a jail are the people I mentioned before your county commission your sheriff's office your um your prosecuting office and your judiciary and so our main focus moving forward at this meeting is going to be jail overcrowding who's in jail um I want to thank uh the sheriff and his team from the very beginning of this they've been very responsive um and they realized or they they realized early on that that when chairman albers asked me to chair this and and dive into this deep dark water of a county jail that uh we're we're just doing this to bring all the information out so that the individuals who pay for this jail and please do not be confused there are tax dollars outside of Fulton County that go into the operations of those four entities that I just talked about so when someone says why does state senator randy robertson care about the Fulton County jail I'll tell you what I told the Georgia Sheriff's Association I care about all 159 county jails because every one of them house citizens that live here in Georgia and not everybody in jails had an opportunity to have their day in court and victims rights matter and how an individual accused of a crime is treated impacts the victims also so this is very important to everybody and with that does any other committee member wish to say anything chairman albers thank you chairman robertson I appreciate your approach I want to be really clear on something this is not political and if you are making it political I'm going to say this one time stop it's embarrassing by some people's behavior right now it's embarrassing by the way some of the media is portraying this right now we're talking about people's lives deflecting to something else in order to take the eye off the problem is always the wrong answer by now after almost 14 years you know me well I lock arms and work with anybody as does the people on this committee so start acting responsible as we all work together to move forward thank you thank you chairman all right um sheriff i'd welcome you back and you and your team and uh glad you were able to be here this morning and when we talked last time your your team just got just got into the good flow of it and and we had to end because of time i'd like to pick up on there and look at right now how many properties you're responsible for that house um detainees what the these detainees uh look like the issues related to these detainees the unique bookings that you may run into uh i know a lot of people um believe that you know what they see on tv is what scene they don't see all the unique individuals that come through the back door that require unique treatment uh beyond what you do i was speaking to somebody today and when i told them they were talking about the jail and they said what's something that would shock me about a county jail and i talked about the number of mills y'all had to serve in a day and they were blown away by that and i told them go find a hotel or a restaurant in the city of Atlanta Los Angeles New Yorker anybody else that serves that many mills a day and and i'd be happy to take them out to dinner and they knew they knew they wouldn't be able to do that so what i'm going to do share because i'm going to hand it off to you uh any questions that may come up uh between senator Halpern um chairman albert's and myself we will we'll ask you to stop and we'll ask the questions as we move through okay. Absolutely perfect first if i make taken opportunity say thank you thank you both uh for your leadership and take the opportunity to come over to the facility i want to apologize to senator Halpern uh my travel schedule and like has prevented us from from getting together so i look forward to uh personally i want to make sure you didn't you or any other colleagues that you have that want to come over and take a we've had long conversations about the sheriff's office and things that we can do much like senator albert and and a chairman in terms of improving and protecting our community so i appreciate each of you for that and those that are joining us via virtually certainly appreciate that as well so again let me start here i am certainly happy to be here in terms of being able to provide and having meaningful conversation around what we have experienced for the last two and a half going on three years since i was sworn in as the 28th sheriff of fulton county i am both humbled and honored to be the sheriff as as the sheriff has alluded to he is born and raised in law enforcement and he is absolutely on point having been in the Georgia sheriff's conferences where you have have graced us to really continue to support what we do around the great state of Georgia so that being said it is important and we we have a slide show or slide deck prepared for you that really really shines a light on a couple things one the aging infrastructure of what we've been dealing with over the last decade plus as well as the understanding that we actually have more violent inmates that are that are being arrested and and this is nothing new to to each of you and and what the state is going through as well and then the conversation around detainees that are more medically sick as well as the conversation around mental health and what that looks like so if you look at the first slide here and we certainly will provide hard copies for you at the end so that you will have that we operate several jails throughout in fulton county the main jail itself the current population and i must say this point in time study was December 7th we want to make sure we could be as accurate as we could with all of the information and to try and push it to one more day or the day before this would really not it would skew the numbers so we want to make sure we had a solid set of data that we could present to you currently at our main jail at 18 1838 individuals ameria an x which we discussed yesterday we are going to restart our canine cellmate program nine of our numbers are down and we'll we'll look at why the numbers are down as we continue to go through that piece but we house our the nomenclature's trustees those that help run the facility under the watchful eye of our detention officers and deputies the lease at the Atlanta City detention center that number has risen but on on December 7th we had 399 individuals there the alpha redder an x which we open in support of those law enforcement agencies in north county to try and make sure that they didn't have to spend hours on the road transporting detainees back and forth there south an x which is similar we reopened after we we shuttered when we went to the Atlanta City detention center simply because we moved all of our female detainees to the Atlanta City detention center the need for more space and the need for more opportunities to to isolate bad actors so we've had as many of us have discussed we've had detainees attack each other have detainees attack some of our staff members and what that looks like from that perspective and then out of county we still utilize oak County we utilize Fayetteville Rockdale any of our shares if you know I have reached out to all 159 shares through the Georgia Sheriff's Association to say if you have one bed space 10 bed spaces we need them we need to share that opportunity here's an important note before we leave this page and that is ultimately two and a half years ago we started out with 3600 detainees so we're down now and we'll go through how we arrived there to 2819 on on December 7th but it's important to note and chairman mentioned this earlier as the chief law enforcement officer as a sheriff's office as the largest sheriff's office in Georgia we also that means there's a potential for 3600 victims and so we we keep that in mind as we continue to go forward from that perspective. Sheriff fact actually quick question the 320 that are out of county is full in county paying to have those in some instances yes so oak County for instance we take all of our probation and probation and parolees down there and and the it fluctuates so then there's Cobb County as well and so we have 280 people there and we'll go through some of the numbers as of this day but yes we are paying out of the outsourced budget to house individuals okay fluctuates based on the number and I heard you say and these are VOP primarily VOP violation of probation only in oak County okay so the rest of them Cobb County for instance is a good example where we can take individuals drop them off and they house them just as they house their individuals so we pay them $80 a day but we pay the city of Atlanta $50 a day per person because ultimately all we need is bed space and we're providing the staff at the Atlanta City detention center are these are the majority of these VOP inmates or detainees are they is their probation with the state so yes and so we'll get to those specific numbers okay laying on and the state has been doing a really great job of helping us way through that right and specifically those individuals that are going to the state that have been sentenced we've created a great relationship with with Commissioner Oliver and his team and so we we have a cadence that allows us to get in at times people will come up and ask and I know chairman Albers has had it were they'll ask if we have state inmates in County Jels and I want to be clear that there's a difference between the jail detainee and a state inmate but that if the if the if the inmate which is a sentence

individual who is out in the community if they violate that that probation and they go to the county jail that the state has a responsibility To that to the to the sheriff's office is detaining that individual holding that individual if you will for them and that they're in the past has been Compensation where where the taxpayers of Georgia will pay to house them in the county jail and so I just want to make sure that That the states upholding it's it's into the bargain and I know we'll get to that further But I do want to make the designation that Like you said O'Coney primarily is the VOP so that that's the agreement we have with them And let me help make further clarification from there So once this individual is sentenced if their sentence to 12 months or less they can actually serve their time with us and many instances we We they help run the facility depend on what that charge is from that perspective and to be clear when you say help run the facility They're considered a trustee and and they're determined that through a classification system that looks at the criminal history All the other things involved to make sure that we're putting good actors into those trustee roles because they're given a little more free-rain to do their job whether it's in the laundry the kitchen or wherever it may be for jail operations So to your point the classified if they can leave the the actual Proximity of the jail what that looks like can they go to another facility and help from that perspective? Clean up whatever that looks like yard work to your point laundry Where do they sleep so right now most of them are in the Marriott annex, right because that is the trustee form Where we keep our trustees there and again is Colonel Clark and I discuss yesterday And let me start over let me forgive me. I know you familiar with these two because they were here So to my left is chief Johnson who is who I pulled out of retirement right he was a marshal from for many years at at Fulton County and then served as Up to major at the Fulton County Sheriff's Office as well and how long is tenured commander and He will tell you interim chief jailer Right although he's doing a fantastic job, but he will make sure you understand it interim is interim but he Colonel Clark has has really taken this bull by the horn for lack of better work and really done some magnificent things that we continue to move forward. So I appreciate that I just I just want to clarify that to see what what classification of Detainee you were sending out of county because I know There does come an expense if we're moving pre trial people outside of county that having to transport them back in and I do notice that Chief Clark's hair is getting wider and wider every time I see I told him that the other day. Yeah, I told him that So let me let me provide some clarity. So for instance Cobb County It doesn't matter the classification of the tenies. They they housing for us. We don't have to staff Cobb County O'Connie County. We don't have to staff, but they prefer probation and parole City of Atlanta. We do staff and so doesn't matter who we send because we're providing the staff For site county doesn't matter share Freeman over there is doing a really good job of helping us Manage our population as well to South annex. We staff. So again doesn't matter from that perspective and then of course the Marietta annex we will use that in terms of Additional staff and beyond individuals that have been arrested in the north into the county and don't have to come back down So right now those are main main hubs. We will do one offs with pop with Rockdale, Cauita or Henry County What we have relationships where and a law enforcement official may have been arrested and so they may have The availability to how that individual and what that looks like so they're one offs from those from there So ultimately that kind of the outsourcing piece there and then the county has working with the board of commissions They have a subset of funds specifically for outsourcing Next slide one of the things is certainly and this is really easy mail versus female and and you can see the majority of our individuals are males One of the things that we've we've discussed is really our population breakdown by race and so if you look at really the telling sign is the Black African American race that has literally 90% of our customers our those that we provide care for are black African American and Of course if they're any totals there, but that's 90.5% of the individuals that we serve The next slide talks about the breakdown by age we talk about a more violent Detainee, but we also talk about a younger detainee and ultimately what that looks like in many instances whether you see it on TV or otherwise it has become shamingly so a badge of honor to to take Manufactured term invocation right? I'm going on vacation for a year or so and what that looks like and then many people Again, and I've said this publicly and privately is that we have a number of gangs Internal to our jail those gangs have now become subdivided and so where you have a blood or a crib We have now Internally to the facility we have a blood that's in 100 or 200 and they have banned together to make sure that they are either Stronger by nature or at least they act as one from from that perspective The next breakdown is is mistaminas the myth that we have a jail full of misdemeanors We wanted to make sure we continue to have a conversation around what that looks like So what one thing we did and we'll talk about it later But it's it's worth noting now and that is we started an inmate advocacy unit and that unit is Specifically charged with going through each one of the cases in Rotation to determine one if we have better resources to get them to court If they're misdemeanors we partner with the DA as well as I solicitor general as well as a public defenders office and the court To see if in many instances we've had this conversation some individuals have been in jail longer than they would have had they gone to court Been sentenced and their sentence was probably Longer from that perspective so this was an opportunity for us to get ahead of the conversation Because and I've heard the chairman say as sheriff's offices we are stuck in the middle of this rotation And so ultimately when you look at this and and we'll go through this pretty quickly The misdemean only cases meaning that's they simply have a misdemeanor charge 103 the other the other thing It's important to note that 151 was December 7th and as of today is down to 142 and the other thing that we do is we will We're very intentional about taking especially as we come up on Christmas We will determine okay. How what this person's charges are But equal is important to note is of this 150 at 150 one at the time 142 today more than half of those are attached to a domestic violence case and so we don't have the autonomy To lean in as much as we do because the judges have to then make make decisions around that You'll see again the trustees are made up in the 14 plus weekend or so in many instances as judges say I want you to continue to go to work. I don't want to break that cycle No, want you lose your your job so Friday at six o'clock you got to turn yourself in so we have three individuals there the competency Which we will continue to talk about is that Space so that person that has to have some mental health comparisons or mental health Services that ultimately we as as those that we provide care and custody we have to focus on making sure we have those as well And that's the last category this misdemeanor with a hole it is up from 13 to 29 today So ultimately that means that they may be charged with a misdemeanor inside Fulton County But they have a hole for cop county or hole for cowlida county in many instances We work with the solicitor general his team and forego that Charge and send them to the more serious charge that they may be being held for out of county Sheriff when you say forego the charge you mean a null process correct, okay? We'll let the course decide right that's as I'm saying so what Victims cases aren't necessarily being dismissed, but they're making the choice is to which case is is heavier more important And they may do a dead docket or a or a null process and then let the other County that has a hole on them coming pick them up take them there and adjudicate that case there right? Okay, I just want to be clear and that's the decision made within the course That's not a decision made by the sheriff's office. It's a decision made within the courts The solicitor general's office or the district attorney's office right yeah correct now the important fact Although with our inmate advocacy unit there are certain people that have been charged With juvenile crimes for instance or wanted for whatever the reason we will now take it a step further to see why they want it And so we've had instances where a gentleman was wanted out of Florida for a crime He committed when he was a juvenile that Florida said they weren't coming to get right and so why hold him in jail? Specifically for that. Let's see what we can do to get him really and I want to be clear. I don't want to I don't want to Mix my apples and oranges the null process or the dead docket has to come out the solicitor general's office of the DA's office It cannot come out the court they make the recommendation to the court right, okay? So I don't want to throw so I don't want somebody in a black robe to run in here and say I accused them of something They're not guilty. No, no, they and and between Chief Judge Glanville and certainly our state coach Taylor as well as I probate judge Kenya Johnson and and I'm at the church Kurt we have a great relationship We've worked really hard on building those relationships so that we can The ebb and flow of of what it looks like to get people Sometimes in jail if there's a warrant and sometimes out of jail is has been well something I want to thank you for on these numbers right here We get a lot of pushback here inside this building where they say our jails and prisons are full of Mr. Meeners and that is not the case But there are misdemeanors in there, but when we're talking about a domestic violence a lot of people don't understand that a simple battery I a violent crime can be a misdemeanor in some cases and so I think when we break it down and look at it that the misdemeanors that are held in our county jails only for a Mr. Meener are usually those types of cases whether some type of violence especially A male against a female or against children and things of that nature and so it's not just Joe Smith walking down the street. It's not Otis the town drunk Being being held in mass in our county jails correct. Thank you sheriff and another thing that's important to note is not only Do the domestic violence or family violence cases get intertwined in the misdemeanor count as well The other piece of that is that we are we again We're laser focused on trying to help people we can But you'd be surprised at the number of people and I certainly don't speak to For solicitor gamuch and but he and I have had Rebus conversations around the fact that we have gone to some of these misdemeanors and said Okay, here's the offer and people just rather stay in jail Because they may not have they may not be shelter They may not have the opportunity, but they know they're gonna get fed they know that they are therefore whatever the time is the court Said they'll be there, but they don't have to worry about housing or or any of the things that come along with that and there have been a number of people They'll just turn down whatever the offer is to help them receive services All right, so on the next page we talked about do you think that's because of your five-star rating? I do Not it's gotten better So and to that point right listen never miss a moment one of the things that is important to know because of the made advocacy unit because Apart in ships with madam DA to solicitor general the public defenders office as well as the courts is we started out Remember I mentioned we started out with 3600 detainees 600 of those were sleeping on the floor on boat on boats earlier this week thanks to to Colonel Clark his team and specifically captain Cedeek who you may have met when we had an opportunity you certainly will meet send the however Literally we have no one sleeping on the floor and share if I want to be clear We brought this up the last time in your council is really good at it when we say sleeping on the floor We are not talking about sleeping on concrete. We're talking about sleeping on what we call a boat Which is a I guess about a six to eight inch plastic Riser that that sits on the floor that are stackable easy to store and and basically it's a cot if you will I lived in a blueberry patch during Katrina. So there's similar to what we used out there But you you're on that you have a you have a mattress you have a blanket you have a pillow in most cases and so it's not Lay it on concrete Curl up in the fetal position Correct, right and so to that extent we have no one sleeping on the floor we do have ten people in the medical or the MOU medical observation unit that are on those Devices simply because they cannot amulet to get up and down and so it is through the medical units advice or the their You know professional experience that it's best to we may have an amputee for us And so someone that are on those devices and that is ten if last time we talk this morning, so okay If I could I just want to take a moment to recognize an extraordinary feat the fact that you've got the population down Means that people are working together as we want them to which means the the justice system is flowing in a way that is Allowing you to reduce the number of people that you have to house in those jails and that is something worth celebrating All too often these days all we talk about is bad news This is good news. Let's make sure we report on it accordingly Hey, man, thank you, and we certainly appreciate that recognition the team has worked really really I mean day and night to make sure that we can achieve these numbers with Understanding that humanity we want to put first so we could get people off of these fluid devices So we certainly appreciate the recognition we appreciate that a jail population breakdown. No, it is it is certainly Ad daunting task when you look at the people we service when you have 421 people chartered murder I Remind people when you come to Fulton County We have the individual we have the spot shooter. We have the midtown shooter We have the young lady that tried to set MLKs home on fire All right, so if it happens bad in Fulton County, we have to have those individuals It's important to note of the 549 aggravated assaults These these are not One in the same so for instance the 421 individuals chartered murder could also be chartered aggravated assault But these aggravated assaults us part and part part separate from the actual charge themselves But you see they rain from from stalking to aggravated Side of me if we house the worst of the worst and share for all of our CSI fans who may be watching a live stream Aggravated assault is attempted murder. It is is that right? It is. That's a very good point very good point So this is again it is It really speaks volume to where we are within Society as as as a whole but ultimately I Remind people when we have incidents is inside the Fulton County jail whether it be a stabbing or Attempted to your point attempted murder is that These people didn't get arrested because they were singing too loud and quiet They got arrested because someone you know was harmed heard a harm and our goal is to protect those That we can as well Any questions around the charges You haven't heard me singing the choir. I could be in there. I know better than that I know better that it here's an important note for us The unindicted cases have dropped to 181 the individuals about 781 I wish we'll think it right so You know as my mom say a Freudian slip so we'll get to 181 here Hopefully but right now where we are is a hundred at 781 Those individuals with the five share from a stop you real quick on this again I hate to keep bugging you but these are questions that come to us more Your overall population is what? 2819 okay, do we have a percentage on that is that about 33% Am I 781 of the overall a little bit less than okay, thank you. I promise you somebody behind me working on the exact same thing Yes, and but it is important to note that of that 593 without with Outholes have been there less than 90 days at this point. There are a few outliers have been there 150 days and what that looks like So we are focused on really again telling the story So that we can get access and allowing the immediate advocacy unit to help push that conversation as well I have a question so as I understand it The way that unindicted is counted I could be held for five charges two of them Might have might be unindicted, but three of them might have been in died like I might have actually had indictments on three of my five charges So there's two sitting out there that look unindicted And the question that I have is How do you parse out the people who have unindicted charges but are charged with other things to just People who are sitting there with no charges and with no indictments at all against any of their charges Does that make sense and so most of those will have a separate a secondary hold on them And so we'll leave that up to the DA's office to to model through that particular point other But on this 781 are there people in this number who in fact have been indicted on other charges There are many of them that have been indicted on other okay, and I know Pete Um, Pete scandal act is here with the repack and he's gonna come up and and present to us afterwards, but Um, and maybe he'll he'll clarify this If you if you're indicted on cases and unindicted on cases I'm wondering is vast majority of time. This is separate cases though correct so so we're the individual came in Uh, we're indicted on particularly because if you have somebody brought in on five Companion charges and all of them felonies that when you would go to the grand jury you would present evidence on those five charges And so you would either Return true bills or no bills on those five rarely where they parse out three Send you back with the true bill on two and then three laying there unindicted correct So these are probably individuals with multiple cases that that aren't necessarily connected perfectly describe Perfectly describe and then what number you? um, five How is that number changed over time you have any recent history and what that numbers Probably lower. I can't tell you when when I took office that number was north of 3000 close to 4000 people Okay So and that and I specifically confirm that this morning and so it is To to send an albors point we are working together to bring that number down And so that has been very helpful to us you're point about true billing We will get the true bill back and so ultimately that individual Those five if two of those cases were parceled out then we don't they still have the three and then The other piece I do want to give you that total is 27.7 percent So I'll make sure right absolutely very very close so All right the next line when we break down One of the questions that we get often is how long people have been there And so we wanted to know how many people were there longer than three years We we did take an opportunity to discuss as we took the tool at the time We had three people at it been there longer than ten years Now those people were chartered murder and those people were charged with uh share for real quick I want you to say that again if you can we did at the time we had three people That were that had been in jail for ten years right approaching 11 in some instances All three chartered murder I will tell you two of them were chartered murder and a police officer right and so ultimately one of the things that we talk about when we talk about mental health Around the state as as we've had these conversations and the mental health Opportunities on hospitals have diminished where we can send people and so ultimately those individuals what happens in the state Competency cases individual goes they raise the level of competency and individual comes back now They have to get on the court count within 30 31 days if not they have to go back through the restoration program From from that perspective. So where do you where do you all typically send uh Detainees for the competency so we have us Georgia so we have Millerville we have Georgia region and ultimately We have our own competency restoration program that we partner with different hospitals with The last person I personally sat talk to his parents and we sent an individual to Georgia regional He has seven people from in front of before okay, and where's Georgia regional is that in Right pants as well. Okay, so while they're at Georgia regional. They are still Considered a detainee in the Fulton County jail correct, so they still come up on your head count It just shows them as being Along to to the facility and the purpose of that is to get them Compat to stand trial or to get an adjudication back that they will never be competent in that stand trial And then the court will take action and have them placed wherever wherever they need to be correct Is are you aware of a statute in Georgia that sets a time limit on how long someone could be In in a competency rehabilitation type facility. I am not and and our stats prove that out So if you look at the 150 people that have been at three years along 38 of them have been in this competency Restoration piece and so we have as many as 50 or 60 that are currently there in less than not less than three years That are still trying to go through this competency restoration So so where are the three that we're in there for 10 years or more? So one case was adjudicated to other two they're going through the program and that caught in this the heaven flow of court Okay, I think caught is a good word Yeah, and one of one of them was sentenced to hear recently Okay, so so once once been adjudicated was that person determined to be guilty? Yes And so now they are a part of the state prison system And the other two still are a part of Fulton County jail and they are going through the process if you will So the two that are going through the process have been their 10 years Nine Close, okay, I know one is close to nine but ultimately the most That's one is stood out the most it was the 10 year Okay, and in the court And I I don't think I'm I A long voice crying in the wilderness where I just find that I mean and look I understand in the in the sheriff's office in the county jail or the middleman in this Um, and in this case, I wouldn't even say that um Because there's attorneys involved in the in the prosecution of the case and the defense of the case and there's individuals involved on the judiciary side And and somebody brought it up before about somebody being in that long and they said well Senator They were charged of murder Well look I you know I dealt with a group of individuals who murdered the all-day family down south towards and the And an individual who murdered several serial killer in Columbus that killed several elderly females and 10 years is just Beyond my imagination and so you know and it being only two is is I mean two is better than the 20 but but two is is too too many and I think that that I'm glad y'all brought this up There's an opportunity for us to look and and see where we can look at some of these competency type Things because I know in the state of Maryland. I believe their competency Requirement it may be five years that you either have to get them competent enough or they have to be assigned to a facility and you move on But thank you for that share. We will if you allow us will be specific on those two Yes, and that may be a little more helpful as we go Yeah, I chairman Strickland is a master at figuring out how we can move obstacles either way in the judiciary system to try to get things Things done and so I appreciate that I like to make note that our slides aren't Displaying properly and so the bio in the bottom 80 is actually 80 Yeah, I was I was lost. Yeah And some of the other slides didn't explain properly So we'll make the corrections as we move forward we'll make note of those issues and let you know what the proper information You get your hard copy and is there a breakdown of How many are three years how many are five years how many are we can do that we just started three years are greater right and so we can certainly get that for you Thank you Speaking of breakdown time and custody, which is a big issue for us. So a big opportunity I won't say issue big opportunity for us to get right. So one of the things that we we focused on was The Atlanta well not Atlanta the American Correctional Association's definition of what average day the population is versus Lentha state And so I know this came up last time during the The Senate hearing and so we want to bring some clarity this point in time study on December 7th showed that we had All the individually at 200 the 2,819 individuals that represented 800 over 800,000 days in jail You do the average that means that that individual on average on that day it was 294 days that they had spent in in the facility When you talk about the length of state and that says average turnover rate and it's probably better described as Lentha state that takes into admissions releases etc the one thing that has been helpful for us as the Board of Commissioners did approve a 15 month 1.5 million dollar jail feasibility study and that jail feasibility study showed on average when you take into account admissions and releases 59 to 60 days as as eternal for a This this average Is this equating the 150 in there also? This 150 yes, so it does take into it so so there it is going to be skewed somewhat correct by individuals who've been in there for three years or longer Four ten yeah, or ten yeah because I read one study very recent study that I looked at last week They said the average time in the county jail in the United States is 26 days correct and I scratch my head Because I think what we're doing is we're taking metro areas and we're and we're porting in all these rural county jails where 26 days would seem like a lot in a 2030 bed County jail whereas bigger jails that's that's not necessarily the case with larger population So I think that kind of skews the number a little bit because 294 is a lot it is and that is that point in time but again when you consider admissions and releases What what the standard is the jail feasibility study came and again? It was it ended up being a really good study Ultimately came out and that's probably better termed length of stay as opposed to average turnover rate But it is closer to 59 to 60 And here's here's a telling slide for us and pardon the The Christmas green and red but one of the things that that is worth noting is that We release less than half the people we take in we take in twice as many people because again, right largest county in of the 159 counties we have 15 municipalities plus colleges and university Police within and so

On average, you look at how many people we book in versus how many we book out. What's not up here, which I think is worth at least acknowledging, is the fact in 2022, we took in 19,209 bookings. This year, year to date, we are already at 20,670, and that represents a... Well, if you will, more than 14,000 people in the city wanted to go for the South Proud is not stopped. A quick question for you, Sheriff. Over the years, they were city jails as well. I know, obviously, ADC, which you're using portion of today. We had a Roswell City jail in my hometown as well. When those cities shuttered their jails, basically put all that population into your system. Is that not accurate? So that is very accurate. And I was fortunate to leave the city to land on detention center for 10 years, or decade, worked there for 31 years. And so as a young rookie, we came in, everyone arrested, and at land that came to the city jail first. They had a bond hearing, or probably the power of hearing through the magic they call it. Yeah, that's good. Oh, okay. We're having some tactical difficulties, you've gone. So let me recap for those that may be online. So again, I started in 1988, and in 2010, I was appointed chief of the city jail. Now, in 88, anyone that was arrested in the city of Atlanta came directly to the city of Atlanta detention center first. They had a probable cause hearing. Those individuals that were then bound over went to the county facility. And we did that on a rotation of every other week. And so that was able to stem the tide of the influx of individuals that came into the county facility. So I was on the city side at the time. Again, in 2010, I was appointed chief. We did that for a decade. We were able to really partner with outside community organizations, as well as the judges to see if those individuals, in those problems, because of cases, really needed to go to the county jail. The minute we stopped in around 2003, 2004, we stopped taking, we'd been in the city of Atlanta detention center, stopped taking state charges. It immediately impacted and opened the flood gates at the folding county facility. And so it- It obviously had been a fidget area. Bringing our guys over to us once again. So I just want to follow up on that, because I think as we look at root causes, how did we get here, when there was an Atlanta city jail, when there was a Roswell city jail in other areas, when that now collapse is into what you have in your folding county jail from all those areas. And there may have been more. But in that process, you weren't given any more resources, any more buildings, any more anything. You just got the inmates with nothing to coincide with that. And I think that's an important point in history that we're going to have to look back at to how did we get here. That's certainly going to be a factor. Great. I absolutely agree. The minute we- Some instances, Roswell, for instance, shuttered their jail, or in our instance, that the city of Atlanta Department of Corrections started really diverting individuals to the county facility, it immediately opened the flood gates, as I said, and overcrowding was exacerbated. And so that's something we hope that at a state level we can look at. And so, Sheriff, at that point, were you only housing city ordinance violators at the Atlanta? Oh, no. We housed everybody. So, and look at it. I'm talking about when the transition occurred. So when the transition occurred, if you were charged with murder, for instance, you came to the city of Atlanta jail first. Right. You had a probable cause here, which may be reset two or three weeks. You still were housed at the city of Atlanta detention center. Because it was pre-first hearing. It was. It was probable cause. Right. Ultimately, the judge may reset the case, whatever that looks like. There were instances where people would get sentenced or take a plea. And so we would house those individuals, depending on the plea and what that- But not a felony plea. Well, it just depends on the judge. A lot of times they reduced the charge. Oh, okay. And ultimately, we would house that individual. But in terms of- we had as many as 800 to 1000 individuals there waiting to go to the county. Right. And then when y'all made the transition, were they- anybody with a state charge had to go to the county, then all felonies would have to go to the county pre-first hearing? They- right. They are immediate arrest. Minus DUI and some traffic charges. Their immediate arrest was to go to the county. Okay. Thanks. Yes. So jail population by breakdown, this is slide seven. One of the things- and we began talking about this- the court order, well, the probation detainees we talked about- again, as we find individuals- and his- his- his- his- his- important note. And I want to give Kudou to Chief Judge Glanville and his team. We are looking at taking some of these cases that are probation- probationary cases or parole cases that are technical in nature because somebody missed an appointment or because, you know, somebody was in the hospital or whatever it looks like. And they end up back in jail because they- because of that and having a court calendar that just focuses on that. And so kind of moving away from this silo approach of- it's my case, it's my judge, it's my- my defendant, and trying to have at least once a month a probation or parole calendar that says, here are the technical aspects of why this person is in jail and do they still need to be here? So- and- and real quick, Sheriff, when- when- when- when- when- when- when- when- Chairman Albert set this up, it's- it's miraculously within a week. I- I read- I read about Saturday court all of a sudden. And now you- you talk about this other thing which makes perfect sense. But it- it seems like in- up until that point when- when he decided to do this, it seems like some people were either unaware of the problem or were very comfortable in the fact that we were just running as things had always been, which you and I started in the same- around the same time I started in 85. I know you started in 88 where we would go in and we would ask those questions, you and I were those why guys, we'd come in and say, why don't we do it this way and then say, because that's the way we always did it. And so we were somewhat disruptive. I believe we- we probably both were. But once Chairman Albert is mentioned this, then I see these- these new things bubbling up. And so I just want to make sure that- are you comfortable that these things will be long-lasting things that will address these problems so that- that we don't get up to these numbers like this, especially on POV cases because the vast majority of them are technical violation cases. On- on rare exception, well not on rare exception, but I understand on some exceptions they will be accompanying with a new charge where somebody may go out and commit a crime and they happen to be on probation during that time. And so they'll- they'll violate them then and they'll have the accompanying charge, which again that would be one of those separate kind of things where one would be heard and then the other one would be heard. But I just hope you see in these meetings of the willingness to keep these things going and not just use them to deflect, if you will. So let me- let me start here. Let me unpack this piece. Yeah. I think both you and I were awfully alike. Yes, right. And as much as not just asking why, but not accepting the fact that we have always done these things and we want to move the needle on that space, to be fair to the court and everybody involved, Saturday court was- took a lot of planning. We were able to do to Kate five cases, but that's five cases that we no longer had to head in our- in our custody and what that looks like. Is it sustainable? I'm not here to politicize or make sure that other agencies have the resources they need to make that happen. I support that. I- kind of the why, for instance, why don't we have night court? Why don't we have night court every single day? And so the judges will probably tell you we don't have enough resources. I don't- I don't get into an argument. Well, and you help us out with that because Chairman Albers and I've had these discussions and- and I know the prosecuting attorney's counsel understands that there's one group in this state that can- that can make new judges. I agree. Can create judges and areas where we need them. And- and that's- that's where we are today. So when we get to the judiciary side and we look at it and if we see that there's a community that there's a deficiency there because I've experienced a night court traveling around the country with fugitives to where I thought, now that's the coolest thing in the world, I could pull in the Nashville Tennessee at 11 o'clock at night with a fugitive and I took them to a hearing so that judge could determine if I had a right to hold them in their jail until I got up the next morning. And so it does make sense but it does require resources. It does require resources and- and I certainly appreciate that and let me be fair to Chief Judge Lambville and Judge McBernick who was the one that came in and said, I'll hear these cases. And so I- it becomes intentional to say, create more judges with the specifics of, they need to be night court judges. That's right. Right? Because- a lot of them are elected officials and that becomes political and we want to stay out of that piece. We just want the work done. Now let me also add to that point is we have been extremely innovative and what I mean is we've partnered with Celicitor Gammich and his team as well as Pad the pre-rester versionary team as well as the public defenders and we've offered in many instances they've accepted space at the back door so that they can really run through the cases and have it on call. Judge if necessary to see, okay, this- this was unfortunate. This young individual doesn't need to be whole- any individual doesn't need to be here. Everything's calmed down. It's safe and let's not have this person spend the night in jail or whatever it looks like. Or there may be pre-rester version options for us to- to lean toward. So you're absolutely correct and- and anything we can do to support that we want to make sure we're there. Thank you. All right. The court order production, here's- here's something we found opportunistic if you will. When we ran the numbers there were upwards of 150 to 200 individuals that had been ordered from state facilities to be a witness or order to have their additional charges heard it, etc. But they were in our facility for two weeks, a month, three weeks a month. And it continued three months on down the line. So we had a- going back to- I'm talking back to 1988. We had a fierce conversation, opportunity for us to- to realize and- and approach our judges and simply say, if you're going to hear the case inside two weeks we'll have the individual. Other than that we won't house them. And we just do a better job of communicating through the bench and through their judicial offices to make sure that we can provide those services. Again, the- the probation and parole piece, the conversations and the- the relationship with all of the state agencies has been very- since I've taken office has been one that I- I take pleasure in making sure so we can pick up the phone, understand, drill down what a parolee or where they are with that- what that conversation looks like. One of the things that Chairman alluded to and the reason it becomes sustainable is if we can get that individual out of the facility or in front of a judge prior to them defending themselves in jail and getting another charge, then we want to do that because there are a number of people that ultimately are affected by that. The number- the individuals awaiting transfer to state custody has continued to drop. So we do a weekly transport based on the state's availability. And so this says 40 individuals that are waiting, we sent 12 this morning. I tried to send off 40 and Commissioner Oliver again has the entire state so I'm sensitive to that as well and they simply didn't have the- the space at the time I'm confident this time next week we'll at least cut the- the number today is 28 as of the transport this morning so I'm confident we'll be able to- minus whatever the adjudications take place this week we'll be able to cut that in half. So again there are a number of individuals that are waiting for foreign holes just like we talked about those that are maybe a sentence that have a hole for cobb or guinet etcetera. We again take an opportunity to look to see if it's if they're whole and what they are wanting for is we can stamp hole for folding county on them and send them to another facility that may not be overcrowded and we want we want to be able to do that as well. Sheriff I've heard a lot of bad things and good things about cobb county but they are considered foreign. In terms of the foreign well that's just a certain knowledge. Yeah it holds for other counties is what we're looking at. Okay yeah right. You said foreign I was thinking of international so yeah. No no if however there are a couple facilities across the pond except these detainees we will gladly send them. Exactly. And then last last slide is indicative of what we are. We talk about an aging facility or aging structure on November 19th we had our latest shake down we took 200-250 our team members it didn't matter where you were working whether it was our six motor officers or our crime suppression team or our SWAT team our future team as well as our jail team and went and did a shake now. And what share could you mention four o'clock in the morning. It was four o'clock in the morning we like doing things before the rest of the world wakes up right so that as the army would say we do more before eight o'clock in the morning but most people do our day. And what this represents is 380 home eight knives home eight shanks eight cell phones 20 phone charges and really the big the tail tail sign here is and we've had this discussion is that I'm surprised to build in a still standing because of where we are now I will give I want to give the Board of Commission and the county some credit we have started a blitz program that blitz program allows us to take the resources to completely redo different zones so we have 78 zones seven of them plus one floor is completely out of commission that represents 300 plus 376 beds that are unused unusable and so we are trying to rehab them because the realization is regardless of what the Board of Commission does do with respect to building a replacement facility ultimately we still have to live in this facility and work in this facility and this in and of itself is a tail tail sign of the building aging and being weaponized and that's important so I'll stop there if that. Yeah sure from I'm looking and when did this operation occur that we're looking at now. November 19. Okay so this this past month. Correct. Okay I'm seeing pieces laying on there that are obviously plumbing pieces that belong in the jail so so basically once you seize all this property there there has to be an ongoing maintenance of the jail because sinks and toilets and other things don't don't work without the pipes. So which results in more damage to the jail and but something that jumped out of you said phones and chargers. How are phones and chargers getting into cell blocks. So any number of ways and please let me unpack this and let me start by thanking Commissioner Oliver while his team did not participate in this shakedown we've had to this year alone with he's he's sent specialized units to help over 200 people to help us. I mean you say commissioner you're talking about he's sitting in cert teams. And that normally shake down state prisons and correctional facilities coming in and using their expertise which I know you have some individuals with that unique skill set also and the largest partnering up. Correct. And so we we create this force multiplier even across different counties. Cobb County and Gwyneth and Henry and so we we bounce from jail to jail to take that that expertise to see how we can create this force multiplier going back to unpacking this piece. So yes off the top where we have had bad apples we've had individuals that have actually been higher to ultimately infiltrate the the folding county sheriff's office we have arrested those individuals as well. We have employed new technology again an opportunity to never never miss a moment to leverage some technology and even state funding if we can find our way to that so that we now before we hire an individual we'll see how many contacts they've had with our detainees what that looks like those individuals don't get higher. Especially if there's any omission from that perspective. One of the things that so minus the bad apples one of the things that is continue to plague us is drones and the technology to detect and to tour deter drones has really really caused a major problem in our infrastructure every other at one point in the last couple weeks every other day somebody was cutting the fence line actually surveilling the facility first using drones and because of the FAA requirements we can't just simply as I wanted to as I harking back to 1988 I wanted to just shoot them down we can't do that so ultimately there is technology out there that help us with that and so those are the kinds of things be the due state grants or anything that we can use we certainly want to be able to do that but at one point we had as many as three or four insertions a week where people were cutting through surveilling with drones and even having drones drop off packages and now it's more prevalent in the prison for environment given the guard lining what that looks like but again we have those are the kinds of things and where some of these things come from and then I'll leave you with this and I remind people just because people are in jail doesn't mean they are not smart and so one instance we are up in the middle of a shake down it's flooding and I actually have somebody from maintenance our maintenance team is saying well I'll go down and get this part and actually the tainy said no you need to get this part I'm a certified plumber bring it back up here and we'll help you fix it and that's what happened so again I'll leave room for any questions or anything senators that you you may have I don't see anything sheriff what I what I'd love to if we could transition into if you're prepared for it as I would like to discuss staffing a little bit as now that we see the number of citizens who are being held in your county jail now if we can talk about how you're addressing it and I also have to point this out as when when people go through this and I know our friends and fire service don't want to be left out of the conversation because fire stations are 24 7 365 but the only building that really has a strong heartbeat 365 days a year government building and 24 hours a day and every second of every day is the county jail and it's a fully functioning microcosm of the city in which is housed and so senator albers and I know on the tour we went into all of the common areas were were pretty clean I like I tell everybody somebody asked me what the county jail look like I said it look like every other county jail it's really ugly and really clean because of the multiple coats of paint and everything else we have to do while we're shifting bodies from one side of the building to the other side of the building while we do maintenance on a different side of the building and this kind of stuff but the inmate housing area the individual bunk spaces were as the individual that lived there apparently was comfortable with them being because as opposed to most housing areas there is no housekeeper coming in there cleaning up and making a beds and most of these individuals that come in there to go back to your word sheriff they they're not there for singing too loud in the choir and so they're not used to keeping their their personal space clean and orderly and so that also not only helps deteriorate the building even more but also gives them a lot of opportunity to camouflage contraband to camouflage other criminal behaviors that may be occurring was inside the facility so you're do you have enough staff to manage all of the chaos that's happening in this building including in those small hidden spaces where a lot of this chaos is happening so first thank you and I will again that's a lot to unpack and and I say it from this perspective the women and men that work in the Fulton County Sheriff's Office I could not be more on it to serve them could not be more on it that they the method in which they serve our community both those that are in custody and both that are out of custody specifically we are working from a 2015 staff and analysis on average it'll cost us four hundred thousand dollars to update that staff and analysis when the staff and analysis was done we were four or five hundred people short in 2015 so ultimately and this again is opportunity as I view it the lens that I look through for the state and you all as you all have supported law enforcement really in everything that you've done and we certainly appreciate that I don't speak for everybody I only speak for the Fulton County Sheriff's Office every time that you are stepped in to help us do our job we certainly appreciate that let me give you some some of our stats when we started I full strength is twelve hundred and eighty three individuals that is we had funding for everybody but ultimately what we end up having to do to pay fair market rate or pay for promotions or pay for the bonus we we hire individuals we give them ten thousand five hundred all the bonus but that comes out of our budget so then we have to unfun positions to then fund the operations so where there's opportunity for us to continue in that we want to be able to do that as well ultimately right now we have a thousand seven authorized positions eight hundred and sixty nine current employees meaning that we have the rest of vacancies we have a total of six hundred and thirty two sworn two hundred and thirty seven we don't cost a billion civilians we call them professional staff right our professional stamina I say that because whether it be payroll or processing I the identification for detainees whatever it is we cannot operate without them share what was your sworn number so sworn is two six hundred and thirty two thank you and so that'll come out to eight hundred and sixty nine the rest being vacant from that one thousand and seven everything else above that has been unfunded so that we can we can operate ultimately to date we have thirty six deputy sheriff positions at a vacant sixteen DO positions at a vacant another forty three positions at a vacant that are our professional team our professional team the piece that that is also good news if you will is that we have twenty seven individuals that are in the cycle for hiring and ultimately it is it is worth the good news to share the this year this year alone we've hired two hundred and twenty seven new individuals individuals have joined our team but we've also had a hundred and fifty nine separations it also bears again an opportunity to work with the board of commissioners if you will earlier this year we will also pay an individual that worked in the jail facility whether you were working on the street and you came in to work on an overtime shift or specifically working in the jail itself instead of paying them time and a half overtime we paid them double time our goal was triple time we hadn't made it there yet but that then is going to wait on the nineteen right nineteen the December that'll go away hopefully they'll be some additional funding as double time goes away it goes away and goes to what time and a half goes back to time and a half and hopefully that will be revisited by the board of commissioners in terms of because you could see the immediate impact you can also see the immediate impact of the resignations based on or the attrition based on both retirement as well as people going to other agencies once the the double time goes away so that is a really a caption of of our employment status and where we are and what that looks like I know you had mentioned Sheriff that the staffing study was done some time ago in your your that will be your opinion if for you wanting to run your jail the way I know you want to run it what would be that total number of people that you say if I had this I'd be aces across the board so right now again given how we found and unfund individuals where at one thousand seven individuals and or seventeen one thousand one hundred and seventeen members I'd love for us to be close at a fifteen hundred and have the funding to to be able to get to that and pay people record look we're talking at one point we were talking about people paying people has it as a duty pay just to work in the jail and bringing some of those attention officers up to you know there is a nomenclature if you will having been in law enforcement that deputy shares are here on this level and and detention officers for as long as I was a detention officer were second-class citizens but to be able to bring that up and and make it a job of choice is as part of what we want to do so at this moment in time realistically if we can get to fifteen hundred that would really offset some of the things that we are doing currently that does not mean that as as a future as we delve into the future and crime continues at this pace that we won't need more what I've asked for and and hope we can facilitate in 2024 is that ultimately we take the same staff and company because I want to compare apples to apples and get and updated staff and analysis which we could really have fierce conversation about and then other thing I want to make sure we note is that when we talk about our vacancies how we get to those numbers versus how county HR gets to those numbers is somewhat different but ultimately it does not include those that are on FMLA those are on workers comp those that so it's important to take those numbers into consideration as well thank you share of how do you get to the number fifteen hundred ultimately if you look at where the pieces that we have unfunded and so and the unfunded is a difference between twelve eighty three and eleven seventeen or was a one thousand seven correct so that's the difference there so if we if we provide the funding for that and we can get back to the twelve eighty three that's two thousand fifteen analysis said we are ready three four hundred people short in two thousand fifteen so I don't want to be greedy but if we can turn back and and even go by those numbers and fund up to the fifteen hundred that's where again a new staff and analysis that you know eight ten years later would probably reveal more so to be clear the twelve eighty three number or we'll just go the one thousand seven number that includes street deputies and that's entire chair office correct correct that's not just the jail correct okay of the of the one thousand and seven how many of those are assigned to the jail and how many are are sound outside the jail and share of correct me if I'm wrong you have people you have street deputies and you also have court deputies and in other assignments trying correct so what help us understand you have the jail bureau is is that how you identify it the jail division jail division okay what are the divisions are there okay so that you have the jail division the court division law enforcement specialized units such as SWAT such as our criminal investigation

Division. As well as our traffic unit division, our admin division. And when I say, let me, let me, let me, and OPS in turn, LaFast. So let me, OPS office of professional standards director. And let me also provide some additional clarity. When we say units, for instance, we're talking about a traffic unit that has six people in it. Right. We're talking about a SWAT team that we, if we can get to 22 full time people, that would be huge for us. When we talk about a crime suppression unit, you talk about 10 people. Right. Ultimately, you also have to take into consideration, and our motor unit, which has six individuals. You have to say, motor, you're talking about motorcycles. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. You also, we also have to take into consideration, and we have the two or three largest trials in the southeast to, to take place, two of which are gang trials. So those units now have been working court since the beginning of the year and working transportation, giving those individuals to and from court safely. And so that, while their mission still remains a sub-ricommunity, it has been jail focused from that perspective. To your question in terms of the jail staff itself, we got 387 sworn individuals, team members working there and 105. But again, allowing those outside units to, the 105's professional staff. Professional staff, correct. And it allows us to have the motor's unit, for instance, come in on a Friday night and work intake. Or if there's any disturbances to have the traffic unit come in and work, whatever that floor is. The other thing that's really important to note two, two, two quick things. We have partnered with the Board of Commissioners and we received funding to bring in a third party to man the towers themselves. And so our contract calls for 87 individuals from a third party company to man the towers. So we've gotten up to 50 or 51. 48 as of today. We had a high of 51. But again, they have the same hiring concerns that we have across the state. And here's something else that's really important and I'm proud that we as an administration and certainly working with the Board of Commissioners were able to do when I took office every individual before they got paid overtime had to amass or collect 480 hours of leave time. Compensatory time. Compensatory time. Before they could get paid overtime. And then ultimately if you used any of that compensatory time, you had to, before you could make overtime again, you had to amass that time again. And so we were losing individuals across the board that could go to different agencies and immediately make overtime. So we removed that obstacle. And that was that was that based on a 28 day cycle. Is that how that time was accumulated? 71 day. 71 day. Every two. Okay. And it was and believe it or not, I when I became sure if I thought it was illegal at best until I sat with some attorneys as we mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman came in who said, no, not illegal, it's just unfortunate. And so we were able to stem that tide and it makes a difference when people can see the overtime that they're working. So the 387 and the 105 are divided into how many shifts? Right now we're working 12 hours shifts. Okay. That is something we migrated to. And it's also bears mentioning that anybody that's assigned to the jail also gets five additional hours on their paycheck. Every paycheck. Okay. 12 hours. How many days on? How many days off? So it's three on two. Yeah. Three days on three days off. Two days on two days off. That's one. 71. Three on three off. And then two on two off. Right. Yeah. And the best part of that is the way it is structured and having again, I go back to 1988 where you used to have to come to work, work five, 10 years before you get any part of the weekend off at this point. So every other weekend you get at least a part of the weekend off. Yeah. Well, when I started it was four days on four days off. So we got a weekend. I mean, you have four days on two days off. So I got a weekend about every six weeks. Right. But and then Christmas was just another day. Right. Because the jail runs. So out of 2007, we're looking at the 387 and the 105 being assigned to the jail in addition to currently 48 third party contract employees. And they you say they work in the tower. So my assumption is all they do is control doors. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. No inmate contact at all. And I would I would as you do your calculations, I would use the 869 to 107 inclusive vacancies. Right. And are you short staffed out? Is it just the jail or the other bureau short staff also? Oh, yeah. We're short staffed across the agency. And real quick, what's an obligation for somebody to get a $10,500 bonus? Are they obligated to stay with the agency a certain amount of time? Every year. Yes. And if they should leave before three years, they owe you $10,500. It's just a program. Right. It's pro rated. And again, lessons learned. When we first started the program, we paid as much as we could up front. Then we cut it in half. Then we cut it in quarters. Now it is divided into 12 months. And so it is almost instead of starting. And it's important to note, instead of starting as a deputy at 60,000, you would start essentially the 70,000. So the starting at the detention office at 50 or 55,000, you started 60 or 65,000 based on the bonus. And then it's pro rated as chief said. And if you leave, we're coming to get our money. What differentiates an applicant walking in applying as a deputy share for applying as a detention officer? Really the skill set. And their ability to go to mandate or go to basic peace officer standard training counts. Basic mandate. Basic mandate. But ultimately, the other piece of that is we do have individuals that come in, start out as detention officers and want to move to deputy shares. There is 10 to 15% pay increase and the ability to do other things and work in the jail. Okay. And is it true belief that if we paid jail officers more than we paid street officers that the jail would be a more attractive place to work? I believe it would be so. I don't believe from the law enforcement perspective. And I don't speak for everybody. It won't be the same. There is a eliteness about being in law enforcement, about being able to protect and serve those in our community that people really gravitate toward. And I still a phrase from from Colonel Clark, I don't believe ever in a day. And we had this discussion that somebody got up and said, I want to work in a jail, right? And those words were never uttered. But I do want to protect and serve. I do want to be in law enforcement and the basic opportunity. I think if we whether be educational incentive and opportunities to move and we do this pretty rare to aggressively. And that is give people opportunities, move from detention officer to deputy sheriff. So there is an opportunity here that we pay them more as we said in terms of the jail pay and has it as duty paid and the things that come along with that. And I think Chief Major Colonel Clark, I think some of it is that I've met people throughout my career that did say when we offered them opportunities to come out of the jail, they said no, I want to stay in the jail. The reason being it's an entirely different environment, the closeness of the unit that works inside the jail is entirely different than once you get out on a patrol squad or investigative unit and stuff like that. But there is that thing you talk about, Sheriff, where you walk in the back door of the county jail as a street deputy, there's a certain amount of unintentional sometimes arrogance that comes in your gate when you walk in knowing that you're going to walk back out, get in your car, do you get to pick where you eat dinner that night as long as it's in there. So I do think there's still a little bit of that bias in our profession that we need to figure out a way to solve. And one thing I want you to know is that the bonuses that we pay are paying in 2023 aren't currently part of our 2024 funding. So we won't have the ability to pay those bonuses going into the new budget cycle. So the bonuses are going away? We have done fund positions, things like that. My assumption is you prepare your budget, you take it to the county commission after much to make, gnashing of teeth, then it comes out and in this case you ask for the to maintain the additional bonuses, but the county felt it was physically better not to do that. And to be fair, we are in the embryotic stages of our budget process. So we have asked for those enhancements, we have asked for those continuations of both the funding, even as gone as far as saying provide the funding for the unfunded positions. And so I certainly applaud, I see a full for the work that she's doing and ultimately we will come January or February, we'll see what we land on. And I don't want to put the impression out. And I know Chairman Alber said something at the beginning, we are not trying to pit anybody against anybody. We just to get to try to figure out what the issues are and to understand it. We ask these questions. We respect all four of the the groups that are involved in the running and maintaining of a county jail. And I haven't heard your team today or in the past meeting say anything to regulatory about the county commission or the district attorney's office or the judiciary or anybody else. I do think it is worth mentioning. You mentioned a deputy sheriff coming in the back door and the pirato, the unintentional, but it's just part of the chemistry. And so I certainly don't speak for the other hundred and fifty eight shares, but I would love to have a team that was all deputy sheriff's. All right, would you allow for and I appreciate the the detention officer perspective because everybody doesn't want to be on the street to your point, but to be able to create parity between the detention officers and the deputy sheriff with the long way. Well, and I think the other thing we think about is medical transport and other things where the individuals sign to the jail, but they do have to do things occasionally that do require a post certified or at least qualified, or a firearm wise or whatever wise to make transports, whether it's to DOC or whether it's to Grady or wherever else in course in the courtrooms and and all of that. I think it would establish that, but then again, bottom line is we're talking about funding and we have to hire people that are able to qualify and pass the mandate, evalk, all the other things that come along with it. And with the issues we're having right now, hiring good qualified officers, I think we've all experienced throughout our career people that just couldn't quite cut it because of some of those issues. I mean, you would think, Sheriff, that if you and I were able to do it, anybody should be able to do it, but doesn't always work out that way, right? I agree. Thank you. All right, anything else y'all want to add, Sheriff, related to the county jail, the overcrowding issues that you have at the county jail, the unique population jail there, or staffing issues? We appreciate the opportunity to have the conversation. We are always available. We look forward to you all coming back or any of your colleagues that want to come and take a firsthand look. We invite you to do that. And if it's anything we can do, certainly as you are in our capital city, coming from two and from your districts, that we can help you with as a holding county sheriff's office, we stand ready to do that. Thank you, Sheriff. We're going to go ahead and take about a 10 minute break and then we'll come up and give our friends at Pack an opportunity to gear up. Thank you. First started talking about the jail overcrowding, the Fulton County jail issues, and everything else. What we learned really quickly is that not only does the average citizen not understand the difference between a jail and a prison, but the average citizen thanks to Hollywood and tax credits and everything else, they don't understand how the criminal justice system works. They'll watch a 60 minute show not including commercials and it'll start with somebody getting arrested and 57 minutes later they're convicted and out the door. And they don't understand all, and I mean thousands of moving pieces and parts that are within the criminal justice system. And a lot of that energy is housed in one of the

area and that's in the prosecutor's office. The he or she will determine in some cases whether there will even be a case to begin with and once there is based on a lot of factors and a lot of case law will determine the speed of that case and understand one mile an hour is a speed. So to answer that the the expert in the state of Georgia without a doubt is PAC and they understand both sides of it better than anyone. So I reached out to their director Pete Scandalakis and asked if he would please help us and he said absolutely right off. So Pete I want to welcome you and your team here today and what I want you to do is educate us those of us in the room and those watching on what exactly it takes once someone gets arrested to get them through the criminal justice system and understanding that a large portion of that time they are sitting in a county jail as they're waiting for the system to work. Yes sir, big glad to. Again, my name is Pete Scandalakis. I'm the executive director for the prosecutor's attorney's counsel. Prior to that and I've been in that role about five years prior to that I was the elected DA of the Caledos circuit for 25 years. The Caledos circuit is five counties just south here, southwest here of Atlanta and prior to being the elected DA I served as the assistant DA there for seven years. Seated to my right, your left is Robert Smith. Robert is the prosecutor's attorney's counsel, legal counsel and also my legislative genius. Robert knows more about what's in the code book than I'll ever remember and absolutely knows where to find it. So I'm very fortunate to have him. I also want to say and I would be remiss if I didn't commend Sheriff LeBot and his team for the excellent work they do. I've known the sheriff for years now and he's always willing and able to assist us on criminal justice matters and has a great voice of reason. And I've said of course I've seen five county jails operated in my circuit. I've said this you couldn't pay me to be a sheriff. To operate a jail and I think Chairman Robertson commented on this it's really like a little city. It's a little city that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and you have all sorts of individuals who come into that facility and you have to deal with not only them but you also have to deal with their families, their loved ones and then you also have the responsibility of dealing with if they have victimized somebody the victims because the victims want to know one is a court day, one is everything happening. So all that comes to fruition when you have to run a jail. And the sheriff commented on this and he touched on this. Before I even start let me say this, I am not an expert on how the Fulton County District Attorney's Office operates nor my an expert on how the Fulton County Sheriff's Department operates. I have not visited the Fulton County jail and my visits to Fulton County DA's office have been meetings with District Attorney Willis on other matters other than the case loads. So please understand if I get any questions concerning those I would refer those back to the sheriff and the district attorney and the solicitor general Keith Gammage who happens to serve as a council member on my board. That being said, I think you have heard here that running a jail and anything in the criminal justice system is labor intensive. You have to have people inside the jail to manage the jail. You have to have even before you start managing the jail you're talking about police officers and detectives making arrests bringing people to the jail. You have to have defense attorneys who are willing to meet with their clients who are sitting in jail. And again when we talk about people in jail we're talking about pre-conviction. For the most part they have not been convicted of any offenses. They're waiting to hear what this position is on their case. And you need to have prosecutors who have the time and the ability to talk to the defense lawyers about a possible outcome. The sheriff is commenting on this and I would be I need to mention this as well because you all know this. We're having trouble hiring prosecutors. We're having trouble hiring defense attorneys. When you have trouble filling those positions you're going to have trouble moving cases. You can hire as many judges as you want to heard you're talking about night court. And I got a little bit nervous there because you can hire as many judges as you want. You can pay judges whatever you want. But if there aren't people working those cases getting those cases filed and getting those cases negotiated, absolutely what you're going to have is a judge sitting on the bench where they court reporter there waiting for something to happen. And that's just a poor use of resources. So those are problems we're facing. Chairman Robertson mentioned about what happens when they're arrested. Please be mindful. We kind of have a checks and balances. We kind of we do have a checks and balances when it comes to the criminal justice system. To make an arrest is probable cause. Probable cause is slight evidence that the person accused of a crime may have committed the crime. The way to say it is to say it is he or she probably committed the crime. However, to get a conviction, you have to be able to prove to a jury guilt beyond the reasonable doubt. And so one of the roles of a prosecutor is to take those cases and screen them out and get rid of those cases. And I say get rid of them. And I know sometimes you have victims who are offended. But one of your roles is to utilize your resources in an ability to get the job done. And if that means you can't make a conviction, you have to have that you have to make that hard decision. So let me start this with an arrest. An arrest is based on probable cause. Now you do have misdemeanors in the sheriff indicated you have misdemeanors. Some misdemeanors are simply citations. Police officers stop you on the side of the road, right? You're a speeding ticket. You sign the ticket and you go on. Other misdemeanors are fingerprintable, which means that if you have to be fingerprinted, you have to some departments have enough resources. They can fingerprint you at the station or they can probably even fingerprint you in a patrol car. Now I'm not sure about that. But then you go on your way. Others sometimes it has to be fingerprinted. You're brought into the police station or you're even brought into the county jail and you're fingerprinted. And sometimes there might be the need to make a bond on those offenses. Usually there's a bond schedule. You make those bonds and you go about your way. Then you have the felonies, a title 16 cases. Police officer has probable cause to make an arrest on, let's just say a child molestation. They make that arrest on a child molestation. They bring that person in. You have what is called a first appearance here. That is within 72 hours. You have to have a first appearance here to see if there's probable cause in front of a magistrate. Some magistrates have hearings in which the police officer will testify. If you're lucky, there'll be a defense attorney there and a prosecutor there that can hear this evidence and can make a decision about whether or not this case needs to go on. Let's just say you find probable cause. That person, if there's a bond schedule or if it's even a, what's it called, a bail restriction. A bail restriction had to be in front of a superior court. Yes, sir. Ask you a real quick question. You just said if you find probable cause at the first appearance. The first appearance. Does the level of probable cause, and you know, rhetorical question, does the level of probable cause change from the arrest to the first hearing or does the magistrate hold it to the same standard, basically, just someone stepping up there saying this person did this. Same standard. This person did this. You can magistrate consider hearsay, testimony, third party testimony, all that. So same standard. So on rare occasion or these types of felonies dismissed at a first appearance. That's correct. Very rare. If you get passed that probable cause, which 99% of the time you will, and you haven't made bond, you can request a fair. First appearance hearing, excuse me, a preliminary hearing, a preliminary hearing. It can be in front of a magistrate. It can be in front of a judge, a spirit court judge or state court judge, in which the judge will consider evidence and decide is there sufficient evidence that this case should go on. You can put up witnesses. Again, you're allowed to put up hearsay testimony during this preliminary hearing. And also at this preliminary hearing, the judge can reconsider the bond if a bond has been said, the conditional bond, and he hears she can reduce the bond and also set conditions on that. The judge can also decide that, well, I'm not even sure you've made probable cause in your preliminary hearing. Therefore, I'm going to dismiss this case. And the judge can dismiss this case. Here's where it gets kind of interesting. If a judge does dismiss a felony case, you can continue to work that felony case and you can bring that case to a grand jury which can then issue an indictment. So the grand jury has the ability to consider charges that have been dismissed and also charges that haven't even been filed. For example, you have an armed robbery and a gang related case. You just say your magistrate doesn't like gang cases. Just doesn't care for them. So your magistrate judge dismisses the gang charge but finds probable cause on the armed robbery to bond it over the superior court. When you bring that case to a grand jury, you can charge the gang case again and you can add additional charges. So a grand jury has that ability and a grand jury is an accusatory body. That is their job is to find probable cause and if they find probable cause on the charges, you can add those charges and take that case on. I know y'all are familiar with 90 days from the time of arrest to the time you get a case to grand jury. You have 90 days. If you don't make that 90 day period that doesn't mean the case is dismissed, all it means is that person has a right to go in front of a judge and ask that his or her bond be lowered. In Georgia, everyone is entitled to a bond. So you don't have many cases or any cases that I know of whether it's just absolutely no bond set. You're entitled to a bond. So when you come back in front of that judge after 90 days, that judge can set a bond even on a murder case. It could be a million dollars or two million dollars. It could be less. It could be a $50 depending upon the strength of the case. But you are entitled to a bond. And one of the things that we talk about is efficiency of the system. During the pandemic, the legislature and its wisdom, and the legislature and its wisdom, made a few changes where you could file a lot of cases. I won't say who exactly I was talking about, but the legislature and its wisdom made changes where not every felony case had to go before the grand jury, which means you could file accusations with the clerk of court and that would speed up the process. Serious violent felony still had to be filed with the grand jury. Of course, some grand jury didn't meet, so we had to wait to file those cases. That is something that you may wish to consider the speed up the process. And I'm sure the defense bar will weigh in on that as well. Let's see. When you said some grand jurors don't meet and didn't meet during the pandemic. That's what I'm saying. But even now, when you're talking about Fulton County, Muscogee County, you got grand jury meeting on a regular basis. But in some of the rural parts of the state, grand jury meet quarterly in some cases. That's correct. And you beat me to the question. Some grand jury meet, for example, Fulton County has two grand juries meeting all the time. Because they are inditing, I think, something like a thousand cases a month. Some grand juries meet quarterly. And then you might have some counties that only have the grand jury meeting once every six months. Which means if it's one of the serious violent felonies or you haven't negotiated the case, you won't see another grand jury once they are excused. You won't see another grand jury tell what if you have one in January or you won't see one until June or July. So that means somebody incarcerated in one of those circuits would sit in jail while they're waiting. The opportunity to go ask for a bond to be lowered or a bond if they don't have a bond. But they would still have to wait. Like you said, six months or a year for their case to go to a grand jury for an opportunity to get a Nobel. That's right. That's exactly right. And sometimes you may want to know, how did the DA miss the 90 days? How did the DA miss the 90 days? Please be mindful that just like in law enforcement, you may have a detective that you may have that is working 30 or 40 cases a month. You take that case, those 30 or 40 cases by one detective and one municipality. You multiply that by five or six municipalities, maybe a couple counties. For example, I had 26 different police jurisdictions that filed cases with the DA's office in my circuit. You take those 30 cases, you multiply it by the number of officers. They're filing cases all the time. Some cases are easy to prepare, easy to review. Some cases take some time. Some cases, even though you have probable cause and even though you can make out the case, the DA or assistant DA or assistant solicitor general wants more evidence because you have to preview case beyond a reasonable doubt. So they're sending their investigators out into the field to interview witnesses, to collect phone records, to maybe get DNA testing, to do all this additional information so they can make a case that is prosecutable where you can convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that this person committed this crime. So those cases, you may miss that 90 days and you will tell the court, your honor, we're waiting for this information or your honor, we're waiting for this information or your honor, the case file is not complete. And then the judge will take that in consideration and set a bond. That's not to say that even after indictment, you continue to work on cases. I cannot think of an instance where you had a major case, child molestation, aggravated sight of me rape, homicide, where you are not constantly working that case almost all the way up to the time that it goes to trial. And of course, you also have, once the grand jury meets, this case will go to what is called an arraignment. An arraignment, it was where the defendant pleads guilty or not guilty. What you don't want to do is indict a case before it's ready to go to trial. Before you can preview your case and indict it, go to an arraignment and then have defense counsel file a motion for speedy trial knowing that you're months behind trying to get information you're trying to get. So that may be another reason that you don't make the 90 days. That is not usual in the course of business, but it does happen, it does happen often. And I think the fact that the legislature understands it happens often is how we got the 90 days plus your entitlement to another bond hearing. So once the arraignment hits, you plead guilty or not guilty. If you plead guilty, the judge will send it down for a sentencing hearing sometime in the future. Be mindful too now. And I have so much to cover and I don't want to waste y'all's time. But be mindful as this case progresses through the criminal justice system, from preliminary hearing to either accusation or grand jury or arraignment. If there is a victim involved under Georgia law, we are constantly, the prosecutors, the prosecution based victim services is constantly notifying the victim. Hey, there's a bond hearing on this day. Hey, there's an arraignment day on this day. Hey, this is the day that this case will be indicted. You don't have to be here, but I thought you'd like to know. Or this is the case of the defendant's going to plead guilty. This is the day that he'll be sentenced. He'll see be sentenced. You have a right to make a statement to the court. So that is also happening simultaneously to this case moving through the system. Pete, when you say the DA or the ADA is notifying this, is that the victim's service? Yes, sir. The victim advocates, the prosecution based victim. Who is housed within the DA's office and is an employee of the district attorney? Yes, correct. Correct. Correct. So if the defendant please guilt on arraignment day, it goes to a sentencing hearing. If the defendant please not guilty, it goes to a trial court calendar. Now most judges, depending upon what circuit you in, will also hear motions before it gets to the trial court, before it gets to trial, I'm sorry. Those motions can be anything from standard motions for discovery, where we have to give over the evidence that we have to the defense counsel and the defense counsel of safety. Pete, I'm sorry to interrupt. I don't want to back through. No, that's fine because I'm going. On the arraignment side, when you say if the person comes up and pleads guilty of arraignment, would it not be true that there's a lot of negotiations happening prior to arraignment? So if the person was going to come up and plead guilty, that there's already some kind of deal between the defense attorney and the DA's office based on sentencing or whether it's probation or whatever, would you say the majority of that pre-trial negotiations happens prior to arraignment or after arraignment? The only thing I can tell you is my experience in my circuit, whereas things have changed, have evolved for years. And that is prior to, I'd say, 10, 20 years ago, we would take a number of pleas at arraignment. We were able to negotiate cases with defense counsel, so when arraignment came up, we could move those cases. Just that time, I would say probably about 10 years ago, most defendants plead not guilty at arraignment and the plea negotiations occur between arraignment and trial calendars. That has been my experience lately. You would like to have more time, and that's one of the things that we used to, quite frankly, when I first started, you had grand jury on Monday, you had arraignment on Friday, because we only did like 30 or 40 cases. This was back in 1984 when I had hair. So you had grand jury on Monday, you had arraignment on Friday, and then you had one week later, the next Monday, the following Monday from that Friday, by the week, we started on jury trials on that calendar. We took a lot of pleas on arraignment, but we were constantly moving. Back then, it was a five county circuit. There was only five assistant DAs, and we literally rode the circuit with our three superior court judges, and that's what we did in every county. Things have changed. We've gone from, in dieting 30 cases a month to, 30 cases every three months, I'm sorry, to do in 60 cases a month just in my circuit. So you have discovery, you have motions. You have not only that, you have defense lawyers filing motions to suppress. You have defense lawyers filing motion to compel discovery, because they may believe they haven't got everything. So you're constantly going through these battles, too, now. As you're going through those battles, y'all are well aware. Prior to the pandemic, a lot of circuits had case backlogs. The pandemic, everybody talks about the pandemic backlog. I always point out, we had a backlog before the pandemic. The pandemic has just increased that backlog. So you're not only the judges, the defense lawyers, and the prosecutors working these cases, they're also working new cases that came in. I also have more motions here, more hearings, more bond hearings. Not to mention, the people that you have sentenced, and have got a split sentence, let's say, or just a straight, probated sentence, what you really hope for is that a lot of those people will toe the line, will finish their probation and good productive citizens. Unfortunately, some of them do not, so now you're back in court doing probation revocations. And that all depends on when the judge wants to set that down to do probation revocations. You do have probation management, which on technical issues, like y'all were talking about, the probation officers can kind of work out a solution with the person who's on probation, so it doesn't clog up the court system, and then it comes through there. Death penalty cases are a completely different animal. We may last years just going through the system to get to the trial. I don't know how many cases we now have in Georgia with death penalty cases, but those are completely different animals. Let's see. Pete, real quick, the process you were talking about, and you saw the numbers, the sheriff put up there, and you heard I'd read a recent study that said 26 days is the average stay in a county jail. The process you're talking about, we're talking, and we'll go to your circuit, which now I think is represented by Herb Cranford over there. I mean, is it reasonable to think that, what do you think? And I won't hold you to it, but what's a reasonable amount of time that you would expect somebody to go through all of the processes that you're talking about, charge with a serious felony, not a capital case, but what's a reasonable time if an individual is not going to make bonding get out? A reasonable time to get him to trial. Correct. I mean, wow. Well, let's look at an aggravated assault, where the individual wants their day in court. I mean, is I can't answer that because of this reason. This has taken aggravated assault, and the person has not made bond. And so, and he hasn't made bond because, and understand, if he hasn't, if he or she hasn't made bond, he or she's had a bond hearing in front of a judge. There's no doubt about that. But if the judge has looked at the case and found one of four criteria, he's likely to commit another offense, which means he's had, he's got a prior offense on his record. He's likely to intimidate witnesses, or he's likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, or he's likely to, what's the fourth one? I already said that one. He's injured in property community. Danger to others, or a position of intimidating witnesses. The judge will, will, will not reduce that bond. So let's just say that this person sitting in jail has been indicted. Then he goes on a trial calendar. Where does that case rank on a trial calendar compared to the other cases that were before? In other words, you know, if you have homicide cases, those usually come first. Child abuse, rape cases, particularly child abuse cases, the further you get away from the time the child was abused, the harder it becomes to get a conviction. And the reason for that is because you don't want to retraumatize the child. You don't want to have a child who was eight years old waiting three or four years for him or her to testify in court. So those cases prosecutors try to push to the top of the calendar. And who controls the calendar? The judge does. Okay. The judge does. But how much influence does the prosecutor have on the judge? Would you say in getting those types of cases up there because, I mean, they work shoulder-to-shoulder on a lot of this stuff, right? I think the judges understand that those people in custody take priority. So any cases in custody and the longer the longer serving cases will get priority over those. So if you have a person who rests a fragurator, salt, he or she has it probably been in very long. The homicide case on the trial calendar is going to get first and then it's going to be, you know, the child molestation cases, rapes, anything of that nature. Did you have something you wanted to add to that? The officer depends on when this will be the order. Oh, and like Robert said, depends on witness availability too. Because sometimes I just say, well, we're going to make this case first. And you'll say, Judge, we got to witness his medical examiner with a crime lab. He can't be here that day. Can we push this off to this day? So you have all those issues. So not to try to, you know, dodge your question, but it's so hard to enter because an aggravator assault sitting by itself, I'd say six months to nine months, you ought to be able to try it. But nothing sits by itself in a courthouse. Nothing sits by itself. What I jump back to is that 400 number of murders that we're sitting there. And then we have these other cases coming in that are not murders, that are not child molestation cases. And so there is going to be an issue with a backlog. Yes. The prosecutor is focused on those cases you're talking about where you have to get the witnesses in there. You don't want to retraumatize a child on some of those cases. So that was where I went back to, you know, what's the responsibility of the attorneys to negotiate and look, everybody's, everybody's has a right to their day in court and to plead guilty into a jury trial, bench trial, whatever they choose. But while we're prioritizing homicides, we're backing up especially when we look at 400 and something homicides in the Fallen County jail. True. And again, I don't know the specifics of those 400 cases. I don't know which cases are ready to go to trial, which cases still have work to be done on them. But be mindful, the criminal justice system is not like a business because even though you have prosecutors over here and you have defense lawyers over here and you have detectives over here. You still have one person who makes the ultimate decision and it's not the judge. It's the person accused of a crime. So you may, the defense attorney may have worked his or her tail off getting a negotiated deal that he thinks is great and goes to his clients and says, hey, listen, I've got a great deal here and the client says, don't want it. Not going to take it. Or the defense attorney will say the prosecutor's not willing to budge. What do you want to do? Let's go to trial. So the system, you know, there's a, and I'll y'all know this because you do this in your private lives. There's a point where negotiations kind of come to an end and you say, there's no, there's no more talking here. We got to get you on a trial calendar and when we get you on a trial calendar, that's when the decision's going to be made. And then there's some cases, for example, murder. Murder has, unless you're seeking the death penalty, murder has, you know, one of three results. Life in prison, which means you're going to do 30 years before you're eligible. Life.

out parole or not guilty and you walk. So, you know, some of those cases you can't negotiate, you have to try them. And we've had a number of those in my circuit. Pete, if I could just for a moment, I wanna make sure that I'm testing my logic on this. From what I have understood in the work we have done before and during this committee, most of the time that just getting that date scheduled kick starts the process and deals are reached and the system tends to flow very quickly. Is that a fair statement? When you say getting that date, you're talking about a trial date? Trial date, yes. I think the trial date, having a case on a trial calendar where you have jury panel coming in helps that negotiation process. I think it would be helpful, Mr. Chairman, for us as we continue to get more data points of looking. Where does the current challenges we're having in Fulton, which are holding people in a jail of getting folks necessarily to a trial date to move that faster? What is that in relation to other counties throughout the state? I'd be curious to know, is there a gold standard out there of the one you can say, boy, they figured something out and can we apply those best practices across the board? I think that would be very difficult. And I say that for this reason, there are 159 counties in this state. My experience has been, there's 159 different ways to do things. Not to mention the volume of cases that Fulton County deals with. Now, when you talk about having a date, let me, because I have to preface it this way, when you talk about having a trial date, I'm talking about serious violent failings, being able to move those. Cases that are easily moved, for example, pretrial diversion, deferred prosecution, we dismissed a lot of cases. When I say a lot, again, our standard was, if you didn't believe in your heart, if person was guilty of a crime, you had no business prosecuting it. And our screening process was set that my assistant DAs would decline to prosecute 29 to 30% of the cases that were filed, simply because we couldn't make probable calls. And decline to prosecute, so what you're saying is the person was arrested, they were placed in the county jail, they had their initial hearing, probable calls hearings, everything went. It lands on an investigator's desk. Investigator looks at the ADA, that there are responsible tunes that, hey, look, it's just not enough here. So does that DA, do they go to the grand jury and ask for a no bill, or do they do an all-pros and just... We did. We refused to prosecute. And what we had, we had vertical prosecution, when it's once the warrants issued, the cases automatically signed to an assistant DA. Other than the investigator getting the case file, that didn't happen. Our investigators only dealt with cases that were gonna go to trial. So the assistant DA would get the case file, review it. If it was not prosecutable, he or she would get the, or warrant, right, decline to prosecute, and send that on, and we would dismiss the case in the file. And if the person happened to be in jail, then they were released. We would get it, we would get noticed to the sheriff, and he or she would be released. Okay. But to go back to what Chairman Albers is saying, and we'll talk about a date, would a common date, or something we've made land on, is the day after a raiment, where the person pleads not guilty, and then that's where they get a trial date, where he's talking about... To add that pressure to the case, or the way it happened in my circuit was, if he or she pleads not guilty, the judge then would say, okay, we're gonna put you, let's just say it's a January. The judge says we're gonna put you on the March trial calendar. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. So he would be at a raiment, you go on a trial calendar. So the importance of, the key to expediting is getting the individual to a raiment as soon as possible, while following all laws, case laws, and everything. One thing I also wanna point out, is that three of the larger public population counties, or circuits, the Atlanta circuit, the Stone Mountain circuit, and the Cobb circuit have two month trial terms. That means there's new jurors, you've been summoned every two months, when Pete talked about, that who moving you onto the March trial calendar, that means that the court's in session, and everything pre-starts two months later, we have in some of our other circuits, six month trial terms, like in Kelly County, for instance, you'll have jurors summoned, and that's the grand jury, that's the trial jury box for those six months, and judges may have one week, they may have multiple weeks, but when you're having these quick turnarounds, these quick terms of court, things have to move at a rather rapid pace. So when you're talking about getting trial dates, you're also thinking about something jurors, almost on a weekly basis for trials. So there's an inherent cost with that as well. And I wanna be clear as we go walking through this, I'm not talking about people who are out on bond. I'm not talking about people who are managing their cases from home. I'm talking about men and women who are inside of county jails, unable to get out, and whether it be bond, or they can't afford the bond, or there is no bond, how we expedite, is there a silver bullet to expedite those cases through the system to get them either, to get them adjudicated? And so, I think back to Chairman Albers Point, is at a rainment, the judge sets that trial date, and that puts into motion the plea deals, and kinda separates the wheat from the chaff, so we know coming down the road, what we really have, that we'll be going to trial. Well, that's the goal, but again, you have so many cases now that it's almost impossible to get to all those cases, even when they get on a trial calendar. I mean, you may have, for example, you may have a trial calendar, let's just say one judge has a trial calendar with 150 cases, or let's just say he or she can break it up to 30 or 40 cases. You're not gonna get to all those cases, in one week or two weeks, if that's what you have jury trials, and particularly if one case takes one or two weeks to try. I mean, so, in one time, it helps negotiate, but is that 150? Is that a Fulton County judge? I do not know. No, what I'm trying to say is, is in the Cal Wheaters Circuit, did you have judges that had 150 cases on trial docket? You had judges that would put about 50, 60, sometimes 100 cases on it. Okay, and in more rural areas. I think of you just as many, because in more rural areas, they don't have state courts, so they did the spirit of what we handle everything. And remember, when a case gets noticed, when we get that trial calendar, which say maybe it's two weeks in advance, we have to subpoena everybody. We have to get all of our witnesses, the crime law witnesses, the law enforcement officers, the civilians. So that's the other side of it is that, I'm sitting out subpoenas, or another assistant district attorney sitting out subpoenas, and you're saying, hey, detective so and so, I need you and your case file available, because you've got four cases on this trial calendar. But Robert, aren't a lot of those state court cases gonna be misdemeanors? They would be. Yeah, so, and I'm just, you know, I'm not trying, I'm just trying to focus on the felony, part of it, the ones that tend to languish longer. And so, because I know in the Chattahoochi Circuit, I can see a judge with 150, 200 cases on the trial docket. But if we look around the state of Georgia, you know, and you look at the bigger jurors that you talk about Cobb and Fulton, I do not know how many cases have, and I don't know what percentage of those that go on the trial calendar will plead. The real goal, the real goal is moving as many cases as you can before trial week. That's the real goal. So you can concentrate on those cases that go to trial, because once you get to trial week, and trial week is typically the most serious offenses, okay? So that's really what you're concentrating on. What number are you? We talk about priority of cases, and trying to move those cases or someone's a car straight like your question. There's nothing under the law, is there anything under the law that says you should treat a case where someone's a car straight, differently in this case, where someone has been bonded out? I think there is. You have forms of peer court rules. Since peer court rules, I believe the uniform of the peer court rules say, speedies go first, and see the statutory speedies, the ones that. Yeah, speed trial, obviously. The speed trial remains to go first, and after that, I believe it's incarcerated in Bob and date. So that's set out in a peer court rule, but nothing under Georgia law in particular that requires that. I'm not aware of it. I'm not aware of a statute. Is that a newer superior court rule? Is that been the rules, as long as y'all know? It's been the rules that's often practicing. It's been the rules that's often practicing. It serious felonies went to the top and people in custody, always went to the top of the. And from what you know, is that how people are practicing it as well in court structure? No, sure. I can't, that I can't comment on. I don't know for a fact. One or a different topic. How is someone's ability to pay a factor dam when it comes to setting their bail? I would think the judges would take that in consideration, but I don't know for certain. I know I have heard anecdotally that sometimes judges do not take that into consideration, but I would hope they would take that in consideration. Y'all did change the law in 2018 or so. In 1761, E that's in one of the factors the accused earnings and other income. Yeah, I was going to make sure, clear, that was something we did back in, the Governor deal the last year. I was a full leader for Governor deal and we did this. I remember it is we codified that a judge must consider ability to pay. It was already most argue a constitutional requirement, but we talk about somebody not be able to make their bail based on their financial circumstances. The judge is supposed to consider that. That way what we said at the time is the, the kid, maybe Randy Robertson's child, that's plenty of money in the family, they might get out of jail quickly as I could pay, but my child might be stuck there as I can't afford it. On a serious note, we talked about the idea, especially you hear all the time, the people being treated differently based on where they come from, and we did address that in the law in that change in 2017, the incredible thought was 18, 2017. I think I may have, may have put on a couple of mayors that year too. Senator, was it not true you were the full leader for Governor deal? I actually was, thank you, thank you. Senator, congressional campaign. Yeah. Yeah. Did you ever, did you work in law enforcement in the past? Occasionally. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, what, what? But to, to, to, to, to something he said, and I know that used to, you had to file an application for public defender. Yes, sir. It was a long, I mean, it was, there's like you're trying to buy a car. You had to put your assets in all this other stuff to determine because we, we found that individuals who could afford attorneys were actually using public defenders, which were preventing those who could not afford attorney the opportunity to get their cases through the system. And so, and so we started doing something with the bonds similar to that so the judges could, could understand if somebody, like a, I don't know, Strickland went in through there, they could afford the $25,000 bond, where if a Robertson came through, it would only be a $2500 bond. And so, but the judges are not, they're not bound by, by any schedule put out by the legislature, anybody else on what they assess the bond as, that's whether it's a dollar to a million dollars, is that, that's right. Yeah, that's okay. So, make sure, because, and that's unusual, I didn't realize that the incarcerated individual stood above those not incarcerated as far as the trial calendar. And I guess that was done, and I'm not being facetious when I say this, out of a, out of a compassionate understanding of the, of the judiciary, I would, I would assume. Well, it's also, it's also, I mean, part of it is cost to the county, and to get, you know, if you have a, and also usually the incarcerated are the more serious crimes, which the community has an interest in, in seeing that case brought to justice. And just a crazy number that, how many cases actually go to trial? Oh, I, I, I mean, I, I mean, I will tell you, majority of cases are negotiated. And the simple reason for that is, you can't, you could not, I know that, years ago there was a, a, a, a, talk about, doing away with plea negotiations. And I used to tell my grand jury, yeah, y'all could do away with plea negotiations. That's, that saved me 90% of my time, but get ready to get out your chip book, because those jails are going to be packed. And if you do away with plea negotiations, there is going to be one person who's going to hear the plea negotiations. It's either gonna be the judge, who has to listen to both sides, talk about how strong their case is, or how weak their case is, and he or she's gonna make that decision. Somebody's gonna decide, because Georgia, Georgia's kind of unique, you know, you talk about aggravated assault, aggravated assaults, not less than five, or, or 20 years in prison. Not every case is a 20 year prison sentence. Not every case is a five year prison sentence. So you have to have lawyers. And again, this work comes down to having seasoned experience, defense lawyers, and prosecutors who can look at a case, evaluate the case, talk to the victims, talk to the defendant, reach a negotiation, and move that case on. Because you do, you have to move cases. If you don't, you get into the situation where we are now, where you have a backlog of individual sitting in jail. And really the sheriff and Fulton County ought to be commended for moving so many cases that they have moved. Because the numbers here, and I don't know the numbers, the Fulton County DA's office takes on, but the sheriff talked about the numbers. How many arrests are made in Fulton County? I have no idea that the number of individuals arrested, or the number of charges, I have no idea. But I'm sure it far, far outpaces the 2000 plus that are being held in the Fulton County jail. Absolutely. Those held in the Fulton County jail, would you say, are just a fraction? Absolutely. Nothing, there's no doubt. And yes, we give priority to those cases in which someone's been in custody, and there's been a child abuse. But if you've been a victim of a domestic burglary, someone has broken into your house, and here she is made bond. You don't want to hear that it might take two or three years to get your case into court. Yeah, that's not acceptable. It's not acceptable for the community, for the victim, or even for the defendant, who has this charge sitting over his or her head for two or three years. What prevents that from happening? Being having the resources, like I said, it's labor-intensive, being able to deal with those cases as they come in the door. Resources within the prosecutor's office? And defense counsel and the court's. So when you say defense counsel, you call my public defender's office also? Yes. Because the vast majority of these individuals are not going to be going out hiring the- They're public defenders. They're higher public defenders. And we had an open door policy in my office. That is a PD, or even a defense counsel, could walk in. We may not have indicted the case. The guy may have just been arrested, but if we can negotiate something right at the beginning, we'll negotiate right at the beginning. I've got a couple of workforce questions. I don't want the topic we're on, but- No, no, it's speaking of workforce. When every time we add a new judge to a circuit, there's always a formula to how many new prosecutors are going to add, how many new public defenders? What is their standard as to how many prosecutors and public defenders per judge in a circuit? There is a formula. It's antiquated. It needs to be reconsidered. The formula is you get one assistant DA and one public defender per superior court judge. Plus, you have an additional two assistant DAs. One's a chief of ones. I think at the time was drug-related or something like that for drug crimes. So if you have five superior court judges, you get five assistant DAs plus two more. That's seven. However, a majority of the assistant DAs are paid for by the counties, not by the state. A better formula would be two assistant DAs and probably at least one and a half or two public defenders per superior court judge. Now, that would be up to the public defender standards counsel, I can't answer that. But two assistant DAs per courtroom is really a good working model, because you can get a lot more done. But this old, you get one per judge is not a good model. Can you talk a little bit about the county paying versus state paying how that works? Yeah. So you get the state pays for a certain number of DAs based upon your judges. For example, I had seven judges. I got nine state paid ADAs. However, I had to go to the counties because nine state paid ADAs to work five counties with the case load we had when I left, it was not workable. So I went to the counties who gave me another 12 assistant DAs. Not only that, the formula is not only do you get one ADA per judge plus two, you also only get one investigator per circuit plus two admins per circuit. So Fulton County, and I don't even know what the population of Fulton County is, I'm a 1 million. Fulton County, 1 million people, is on the same formula as Caledia Circuit, 350,000 people. Fulton County got one state paid investigator and two state paid admins. I got one state paid investigator and two state paid admins from the state. Everything else that Fulton County has has to come from Fulton County. Everything else that I got has to come from the five counties. So I had to negotiate with five counties to supplement my budget. And that also creates the issue where the metro areas are now paying significantly better wages than the non-metral areas. So you have a migration of experienced prosecutors that want to work in the urban areas, which is understandable. But there are some circuits now where they may have six assistant DAs allocated by the formula. And right now they only have three working. You don't want to just want to re-emphasize something you said to make sure that everybody absorbs this who's listening either in person or online. There's a million people, this is our largest county. It's our capital county. I think it's actually more than a million now. People and the formula is working identically for somebody that is one third or less of that size. That is as glaring as glaring can be. Nobody can dispute that math. And certainly something as we're going through this process that we need to look deeper and to figure out how we bring things to be more consistent. Now perhaps that was set at such a long time ago that those numbers weren't so off. Obviously the metro area has grown and it pays much faster than most areas of the state. However, now is a good time for us to look at updating that. We'll be glad to work with you on that. And I 100% agree it is an antiquated formula. And it doesn't take into account the number of cases, the number of individuals who are coming into our criminal justice system. Nor does it take into account. And I think you all heard this. And you guys are at the epicenter of trying to deal with this. The number of mental health issues that we're dealing with at the local level. Is that within the prosecutor's office? Even within the prosecutor's office. When you have a defendant or a person charged with a crime that has mental health issues. And let's say he or she hasn't committed a violent crime. Let's just say he or she is somebody that needs help. I remember particularly one person who was coming through the criminal justice system and his family was telling me, there's no other place to go. You have to help him. And I was telling him, I don't have the resources in our circuit to help him the way he needs to be helped. And this was a young man who was having schizophrenic problems who simply would not take his medication. When he took his medication, he was fine. When he didn't take his medication. So where was the place we had to keep him in jail? And when you're dealing with these huge problems now, again, you need serious, you need experienced, seasoned people that can handle these situations. Who set up the formula to begin with? It was a formula when I had hair. Like I said, back in 1984, I don't know who set up. Who manages the, I mean, it's not in code, right? It is in code. Is it the per capita? There's no per capita. I will. Let me, I'll get Robert to research it. And we'll get back to you. I know there's a statute in place that talks about the number of personnel for a DA's office. I think, and again, Kudos to Chairman Albers for setting this up, these are the exact kind of problems that we just, that we wanted to find in this process. To where if our capital county is handicapped by an antiquated code that we could use to help make a stronger public defenders office, a more robust prosecutor's office to move these cases, then that's something we need to look at and see if that's something that we can do. And when I finally had the resources that I could have somebody in magistrate court and defense, and defense, the public defender could have somebody in magistrate court, the number of cases we could either negotiate or settle as they got in the front of the process was, I don't want to say astronomical, but so viable. I mean, it paid for itself to have somebody sit there, listen to the probable cause, listen to the evidence, and then either dismiss the case or negotiate the case right then and say, my client will take this, the victim's fine with this, let's go on. I know a lot of those come up with what in county a lot, but you have the idea right now too of just having different ways of doing around the state based on what local counties can do. You got to think in rural Georgia, especially a hard disk to have the resources. And so if we have a one size fits our mallet, we're funding. I know this is way of a lot of things at the state level. We were talking about last week about superior court judges and how we, it was different around the state, trying to maybe make that uniform. But right now, I don't know what's going on in Fulton County, I'm not sure if they maybe you're spending a lot of county money and actually have the resource they need or not. I don't know the answer to that. But either way, you're relying upon local governments to make those decisions versus having a statewide standard. And that's what concerns me. And I think it's important that we always talk about public defenders as well as you said, because you need them as part of the system. Once you've, once you've decided a case of moving forward, there is much a part of the process of your offices and getting the cases moving. Absolutely, there's no doubt a well funded, a public defender season system that has seasoned PDs in it as a tremendous amount of work. Because we have public defenders who have 50 clients sitting in jail who are trying to get each client to do process while protecting all of their rights. And these are men and women who, I think, looking at the pay or being, they could easily go out and set up a private practice and make better money. Yeah, easy. And not only do they have the 50 clients that are sitting in custody, there may be another hundred that are not. That's right. And they want their day in court too. And so does their family. And again, same with prosecutors. I mean, yes, prosecutors, you have a family you have retained lawyers that you're dealing with. But I'll just go to back for the assistant DAs. But they work hard. You know, they work hard. I mean, and they put in weekends and they put in long hours. I can remember as an assistant DA, even back when I didn't have the case load that we had today. I mean, I left work, I left for work before my kids woke up and I got back after they went to sleep. And they don't make a ton of money. I mean, they don't even know. The highest paid assistant DA who's been with us 20 years makes a little bit of a hundred thousand dollars. Well, Pete, if we go out of the limb here early in our second meeting and we say that the reason our jails are overcrowded is because we have an antiquated system of prosecution set up. Then that's our goal is to find a solution to break that clog there on the prosecutorial side so that these cases can start flowing out of our county jails and being adjudicated. Would you think that would be an admirable goal to alleviate the overcrowding in our jails? Absolutely. I would think that'd be an admirable goal. But you know as well as I do, there's no one reason that this is happening. There are multiple reasons this is happening. Well, I think there's ways to go about it and that is one of the solutions that will help. But I think if we look at the four individuals that have the play the role in our jails, which is what we're here about as a Fulton County jail, you know, county funding when it comes to the jail has to do with the staffing and the maintaining of the jail while the individuals are there. The sheriff's responsibility is to manage the jail while the individuals are there. The sheriff is not the one clogging up the judiciary and the prosecutorial side. The county when focused on the jail would not be the one. And we can talk about county funding in the DA's office, county funding in the court system. I see what I'm saying. But so you know, it seems right there's where we're bumping up at the instincts. People are coming in the back door, but they're not going out the front door through the court system fast enough. And if that's because of a lack of resources, if it's because of an old antiquated system that does not work anymore. And look, I know the chairman and I both got in phone calls complaining about judges complaining about prosecutors, complaining about everything since this started. But I think the problem is a little more complicated than that. Absolutely. And so prosecutors are the gatekeepers. I mean, there's no doubt where the gatekeepers, where the first ones that get access to the file, where the first ones that can look and see if a case is prosecutable or not. But the public defender's office has a huge role in that. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Absolutely. Something going on. Look, go ahead and speak of it. 1518, 1518, 1511. Oh. Yeah. 1518, 14 is about how the number of assisted DAs are appointed. 1518, 14.1 is about the where each DA's office is given one investigator. And then I believe it's 1518, 19 is where the the law sets it up for one administrative staff person. Does it cite when that was put in the code there? Does it happen to say when Pete and here doesn't go back that far. And I'm allowed to sort privilege. Absolutely. It doesn't say when exactly it does reference back to 1977. And Pete, yeah. Back in my college days, the university I talked about almost 47 years at minimum. See, I would say that's something worth revisiting. I would agree. I think it's important to not just get called on what the code says and what we think what I have today.

we'd actually look at what we have today based on what the counties are paying for. Because if it's big, we're at a right model in a lot of counties and we're just making it sound great setting a new standard that we're already meeting. Does that make sense? I'd like to know more about what each circuit is doing. There's some very generous counties. Some counties that are very helpful to both the DA's office and the public defenders office in terms of providing additional staff. There are some that don't have as many resources and aren't able to help out as much. But Chairman Strickland's point, if we don't understand what everybody's doing around the state, there's no uniformity to it, then we're just fighting against the rip tide. Because to Pete's point earlier, of Fulton County hiring away, especially in the Caluita circuit, we're so close and people can drive back and forth to work, then we're not solving our problem because during the appropriations meeting last week, they, her grandfather gave us the numbers of the ADA shortages and the other issues that were impacting the prosecutors around the state. And again, wealthy counties have figured it out, but the individuals who are arrested in non-wealthy counties, they had the constitutional right to the same system of due process that anybody else has. So we need to make sure they have a same system that works also, which I keep emphasizing gets back to our goal of not having people sit in our county jails, either they're at home adjudicated as not guilty or they are in the prison system serving their sentence. And I think also it talks about if you have two systems of justice where you can afford the resources and you have it. Not only do you have people sitting in jail, but you also have victims awaiting their day in court. And if you're a South Georgia victim, and your family was arm robbery and home invasion and somebody was killed, and there's only three of the six prosecutors are available because they can't fill three positions. And you're gonna have to wait. That's just as bad. Well, I think one thing that you've shown us today, and I think it's something that a lot of a snow walker into this mean today is the prosecution of an individual is not a simple process. And that there is no straight line from somebody coming into the county jail to somebody standing in front of a jury of their peers. There are so many side roads and all framps during that process with everything from negotiations to we're in Stewart County where grand jury meets once a year or we're in Fulton County where the grand jury meets constantly throughout the year and cases or should be being moved through the system. And I was very fortunate. You know, when you're a DA that's been elected six terms, you've developed relationships with law enforcement with the chiefs and the sheriffs. And those relationships enable to me to tell them, this is what I need in the case file. As soon as you get me that case file, as soon as we can move that case, and I never had any problems with that. Never had any problems. And sometimes just sitting and waiting for a case file is enough to make anybody go crazy. It won't happen in 57 minutes like the chairman said. Like it happens on TV. And in 26 days in jail is not. No, sir. That should be no one's expectation. No, sir, I can't say that happens. No. Would you, would anything you gentlemen would like to add to what you said today? No, I just appreciate the opportunity to appear before you all, I always enjoy it. Yeah. Well, and I appreciate the education because even when, even when, even when chairman Calderitz cross-examining me, yes, I enjoy it. Well, or when Senator Stone, I mean, Strickland has you six hours in judiciary. To this area answering his, yeah, that's right. That's right. Pete, I appreciate you and Robert, I know you're underpaid. You have a client that you struggle with each and every day. That is the truth. There's no doubt. I'm not under oath, but I will say that's the truth. Well, any other committee members with any questions or comments from PAC? Okay, if not, again, thank you all so much. We appreciate y'all and this meeting will be adjourned. I appreciate y'all. Thank you.
