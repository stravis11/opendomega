Without objection, Senator from 6th, excuse. And then I'll move that the Senate agree to the House amendments to the Senate substitute to HR 7. Secretary, read the caption. House resolution 7 by Representative Campbell of 171st, the resolution honoring the life of Mr. George C. Trudeau, Jr. and dedicated to his memory and further purposes. Mr. President, the Senate offers the following substitute to House resolution 7, resolution dedicated to important state highway system and further purposes. Mr. President, the House offered the following amendment to amend the Senate substitute to House resolution 7 by inserting out the following between lines 371 and 372, whereas Chief Jeffrey E. Turner is highly recognized citizen by the citizens of his community and state by local government officials as a person of unquestionated and further purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I can ask the senator from 27. All right, guys, this is three of three on our road namings to House had a last minute ad for Chief Jeffrey Turner. This bill, if you look on your desk that was dropped, this is the green bill here. This has the bulk of the Senate road namings in it and with that Mr. President, I'll answer any questions or yield the well. You do have one question. The senator from Perry, Georgia. Thank you for recognizing me, Mr. President, with the senator yield. Yes, I will. I was wondering if you were going to call for a power hour or not. Is that is that where we're going with this? Senator, can I ask my question please? I yield. I yield to my to the chairman. So, senator, I'm sorry whether you'd now quite a while. I've never known you to be this agreeable, especially with house changes. What's going on? Well, the house, you know, is late in the day. The house is finally passing us some good legislation. It took 40 days, but they are finally passing us a few pieces of legislation. They're worth considering this consideration of this August body, Mr. Chairman. Would you further yield? I do. So, Senator, are you staying strong for the Senate position on these things? I'm going to agree to the House amendment probably for the first and last time in my life, Mr. Chairman. Well, I'm proud of you. You're a fighter. One further question. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that we ought to have dedicated this, the senator from the 27 power hour? We all have missed opportunities in life. Mr. Chairman, that was one of yours right there, not calling for that motion. Mr. President. Mr. President. I'm sorry. Can I call his name? Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion that at 4.47 pm on April 4th, we vote for this to be the senator Greg Dolezal power hour. Really, it ought to be the power session because he's been to the well quite a bit, but. Yeah, he has been a busy little fellow. But your motion is out of order right now, but maybe we can take it out later on, right? Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Senator from 36. At the appropriate time, I'd like to ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 33rd. Mr. President, I thought she was going to ask for a Greg Dolezal power hour, but you never know. I'll tell you what, I think you've built a coalition here, Senator. So there's no more. Well, Senator from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator you? Yes, sir. Senator, these past three bills that we passed, you've sponsored them all, correct? I've been the senate sponsor of a couple of them. Yes, sir. Actually, I'm carrying all of them today. But actually none of them have I sponsored. The question I have is, Senator, you've obviously built a reputation of being a very small government conservative, correct? Yes, sir. Do you know how many pages of code you have added to the state government over the past three bills? Not as many as my other bills have struck, Mr. Chairman. You could have also said, that you think I added a really big one earlier, I get that one. So would it be a friendly amendment if we were to take and later I'll make a motion to the Greg Dolezal power hour and add to that, the Greg Dolezal and government expansion power hour? That I would accept as a friendly motion. All right, Senator, you can do. Thank you, Mr. President, a little. Any other senator which to speak for against this measure? Hearing none, hey, Senator Walker. Sorry, may I sit in front of the 20th? No, you wave. Okay. If they're appropriate time, okay. All right. All right, so the senator from the 27th has moved that the Senate agreed to House amendments to the Senate's substitute on HR 7. All those in favor of vote, yay, I'll pose, nay, Secretary, I'll lock the machine. Thank you. You All in the Senate. I agree to the House amendment to the Senate's substitute. The yay is our 15th and the day is our zero and this motion has prevailed. Senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to make a motion. I'm going to kind of amend my motion. So from the from four o'clock PM Eastern Standard Time to five o'clock PM Eastern Standard Time April 4, 2025, I make a motion that we designate the Dole's All government expansion hour and it'll be if you the acronym will be D O G E. Oh, that's funny. All right, just hold that thought real quick. So just hold that thought. We're kind of moving along at a good pace right now. I recognize Senator from the 36. I'd like to ask unanimous consent to excuse the Senate from Senate District 22 for business inside the Capitol. All right, without objection to Senator from the 22nd is excuse. We'll come back to that power hour motion there, Senator. All right, recognize Senator from 21st. I move that Senate agree to the House amendment to the Senate substitute to HP 155 as amended by amendment two. Secretary read the caption. House Bill 155, where I was an innocent of the 10th and others of those we can tell an act to amend the article 7, 736, the title 36, although she's able to procedure for resolving annexation to speed. So it's revised procedures for the select an objection to arbitrators, revise how arbitration panels report their findings and recommendations and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate offers following substitute to House Bill 155, it builds on the title and act to amend article 7, chapter 36, the title 36, the O C G A will be to procedure for resolving annexation disputes and for other purposes. President Senator Beecher, 21st, over the following amendment number two to amend the amendment to Senate substitute to HP 155 replacing lines 1 through 18 with the following amendment to Senate substitute to House Bill 155 by inserting after arbitrators on line four of the following to amend chapter 62, title 36, the O C G A will be to develop and authorities. So to provide that county development authorities for certain counties shall amount of operate with and certain municipalities to provide for definition by inserting after line 195 the following section 1-3 and further purposes. Mr. President, I can please the order. I recognize the Senator from the 21st. Thank you, Mr. President. I bring to you House Bill 155 and an amendment. Basically House Bill 155 strengthens the integrity of annexation, annexation disputes by enhancing fairness and providing clear procedures for both cities and the counties. It's supported by GMA and ACCG. That's part one of it. My amendment basically what it does is the amendment allows the six cities in North Fulton by local resolution to opt out of the Fulton County Development Authorities jurisdiction to offer property tax incentives. It's supported by all six cities and the school board, the county's neutral on this. This was brought about by 30 years ago when I moved to North Fulton 32 years ago. There was two cities and everything was unincorporated Fulton. Now everything has been municipalized and there's no unincorporated Fulton County. So the cities want to control their own economic development and their own development authorities and not have Fulton County doing any business up there. That's all this bill does. I'll yield for questions or I'll yield the well, Mr. President. No questions. Thank you. Bring it on to the center from the 14th. The 130th century, 130th century, let the secretary finish this amendment. I apologize. Mr. President, the House offers following amendment to amend the Senate. Subsecute House for 155 by replacing lines 424 through 437 with the following. Mr. President, for other purposes, Mr. President, I can please the order. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it. You know, Wales, you're. Thanks, Mr. President. After a long textual journey in which I had to read and reread the amendment, I rise in support of the center from the 21st amendment number 2. The reason I do that is because I typically, as a matter of, you know, in any legislative discussion we're in, do not want there to be multiple development authorities that are operating in the same space. Because as a general matter that creates a race to the bottom, where development authorities have an incentive to keep out competing each other, giving away more and more tax revenue for a project. So the reason that I'm okay with the development of court authority of Fulton County not operating in North Fulton cities, especially when those cities deliberately opt out, is because I don't want the D.A.F.C. to be competing with the city development authorities that may already be operating in that space. Now, there are different views from the minority party on this, different views from Fulton and Atlanta legislators. So I do not purport to speak for all of Fulton and Atlanta, but I just wanted to explain why I will be supporting the center's amendment. I'll yield for any questions. You do have one question, Senator. I recognize Senator from the 41st. Thank you, Senator. I think you must present it. Senator, do you yield? I yield. So if my understanding your reasoning here, it's because you believe that it's possible that there would be two competing development authorities. Is that right? Correct. However, isn't it true that the second development authority that you're concerned about, which would be a Fulton, North Fulton cities development authority, has not become law at this point? Well, there's not a new omnibus North Fulton development authority, but there are some cities who have their own municipal development authorities. One issue that has occurred in Atlanta is that Atlanta has a municipal development authority that is in tension sometimes with the operation of the development authority of Fulton County. So as a general rule across the board, I'm trying to be consistent. I don't like enabling multiple development authorities to operate in an overlapping way. And so that is my reason why if the North Fulton cities say by resolution or ordinance that they do not want DFC to operate, I want them to have the freedom to do that. Thank you. Thank you. With no further questions, I'll yield the well. Thank you. Yes, Senator Newsyilder. We're going to ask Senator from 39th. Thank you, Mr. President. So I rise in opposition to amendment two as the chair of the Fulton County Development Authority. This bill got to the house. There was some changes and substitutes made to the bill that everybody agreed upon. There was a compromise that would have still allowed the Fulton County Development Authority to operate in North Fulton. If the cities allowed them to, this amendment takes away the ability for the development authority, the existing development authority that has already done so many great projects in the northern part of the county. This is a very important thing to do with the Fulton County Development Authority to be able to do that any longer. This is completely flying in the face of the compromise that was reached very delicately from lots of different partners over in the house. This starts us back from scratch with the original bill, which is not the one that was worked on over in the house. This is a work that has happened over many, many years throughout the entire county. Understand that each of the different cities can have their own downtown development authorities or their own authorities. And some of them do. And even with the duplicative nature of a downtown authority and a county authority, so much great work has been done. To now decide that only the municipal authorities should be the ones that are empowered to bring huge investments in projects to the county is a major shift in philosophy and policy. I urge you to vote down this amendment and allow our Fulton County Development Authority to continue to do the good work that they've done bringing hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the county. Thank you. Unless there are questions I yield. Questions, Senator. Senator from 56. Appreciate all the comments. I rise in support of the amendment and the work that was led by the senator from the 21st. It's probably more familiar with this than all of us in the room put together. I think that's the only thing that's not important is you have two different development authorities that sometimes are competing against each other. It's a race to the bottom. We're actually trying to give away more people's tax dollars. That's not good for the people that they represent. Having the most local control in charge of doing that is best for the people that live in that community. So I'd urge your favorable consideration of this bill amended with amendment number two. Does any of the senator wish to speak for? I guess measure. Chair here. Senator. There's a treasure. I want to close the debate. You wait. All right. So we'll take it up. Amendment number two. Authentic by the by the senator from the 21st. Is there objection amendment? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The senator agrees that the House amendment to the Senate substitute on Hp 155 as amended by amendment two. All those in favor of vote. Yeah. All opposed. No. Secretary one. Let them. All opposed. All opposed. The Senate agrees to the Senate substitute as amended by amendment two. The A's are 36 and the A's are 17 and this agreement has prevailed. Mr. President, I move the Senate agree to the House substitute to Senate bill 132. Secretary Reed captioned. Senate bill 132 by Senator Scherke and other second and other students we can tell them act to men part 2, Article 6, it's Chapter 7, Title 17 of the official going to judge annotated, related to insanity and mental and capacity. So it's required to require a hearing before our court orders and evaluation of mental competency of an accused person to send trial to vice-relasive reports and for other purposes. The House offers the following substitute to Senate bill 132. They will tell an act to men part 2, Article 6, Title 17 of those to G.A. to insanity and mental and capacity. So it's required a hearing before our court orders and evaluation of mental competency of an accused person to send trials, for a lease of reports of such evaluations to salvage our procedures and cases where the subject has been accused only of one or more nonviolent misdemeanor offenses including automatic design. So in some cases and for other purposes, Mr. President, I complete the order. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, Senate Bill 132 was a bill that you all voted for a couple of weeks back that deals with the process of someone not being competent to stand trial. And we put some more due process within that procedure. We made it where certain misdemeanors, there's a shorter time clock for competency restoration, make sure folks aren't sitting in our jails waiting to be restored long. They would if they played guilty to the charge itself. Working with the house, there was one part of the bill we had an understanding behind the scenes to keep working on over there. It deals with that hearing in the initial phase. And so if you look at the pink sheet, lines 45 through 50, this is where the initial process comes up where a judge is going to look at someone to see what not their competent to stand trial and start the process of being evaluated. And we just added some more due process in there making sure that there always is a hearing on the front end of these, that the prosecutor has the ability to submit information themselves, that any evidence presented by the accused can be ex-parte and making sure that all evidence of it is under seal. And so it was a way to make sure we cleaned up and spelled out for all our courts how this initial phase would work. Happy to take any questions. It just looks like your wife is the only person who has a question over there. She's, she's, yes. Oh, that's right. Well, we'll, we'll let her ass out when you get back over there. All right. Oh, you'll, uh-huh. Yes, sir. Does any senator wish to speak for against the measure? All right. So the senator has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on SP 132. All those of favorite vote, yay. I'll pose nice. Secretary and lump machine.

All the motion to agree the A's are 15 and A's are one and this motion has prevailed. Recognize Senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute the Senate bill 125. Secretary Reed the caption. If it won't be 5 by Senator Walker the 20th and others will be to the 10 and 9th to men. Chapter 15 to the 43th. The fiscal agenda to professional engineers and land surveyors. So as to decouple the sequential order of experiencing examination requirements to write related matters to the bill of the working laws and for other purposes. Mr. President the House offers the following substitute the Senate bill 125. The bill to the 10 and 9th to men titles 810 36 43 and 46. The fiscal agenda to the bill of the housing and housing, commerce and trade, local government, professions and businesses and public utilities and public transportation respectively. So as to write provisions related to professional license to establish on behalf of professional licensing boards under the jurisdiction of the Office of Secretary of State. Continue education tracking solution to moderate compliance of licenses and for other purposes. Mr. President I complete the order. Recognize Senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues you'll be relieved to know and to hear that I believe this is the last occupational licensing bill that I will bring to you this session. The past Senate bill 125 related to professional engineers and the timing when they could take their licensing exam. It was not a controversial bill. We've added to that House bill 187 and House bill 34 that passed almost unanimously, maybe unanimously in the House. And those two bills House bill 187 and House bill 34 passed unanimously out of the Senate regulated industries committee. So the committee did vet these these two House bills that have been added. We added clarifying language. This has to do with the master plumbers. We added clarifying language to the master plumbers occupational licensing code to protect their ability to work both inside and outside of buildings. And they were the plumbers parties were involved in that. And then we made it so that all licensing that need continuing education for renewal that they will track that online. It doesn't specify the service they have to use. So it doesn't select like one vendor that they have to use, but they have to provide CE tracking online use a service that is out there. Good pro business bill to further streamline our occupational licensing code. I ask for your favorable vote on this. Thank you very much. I think you got a man of your status. Folks want to question you. Got a question from the Senate from 27th. I thought I might. My sweet mate. My good, good friend. He is sweet. Somebody I really have great respect for. Thank you Mr. President. This is a streamline in government by the way. Chairman D. E. Yield. It's red tape, rollback stuff here. Chairman D. E. I mean, Chairman D. E. Yield. I'll yield for. You yield for a series of questions. Yes, I will. Mr. Chairman, I'm looking at your bill as it passed the Senate here. And it's pretty light. Three pages and 43 lines. Does this look like your Senate bill? If you say so, Senator, my vision's not that good. Senator, this is the bill after the house got done having their way with you apparently. And this bill is 48 lines and 1226, I'm sorry, 48 pages in 1226 lines. Is that sound correct? Yes. Chairman, how many pages of new laws do we need to roll back the red tape in the state of Georgia? There's a lot of red tape. It takes a lot of word to roll it back. Essentially, it's combining three occupational licensing bills into one. Chairman, you have more fish in than dealing with three things. We're just dealing with one now, one bill. I got you. Well, you have been a champion for lowering the licensing burden in the state. I do want to thank you for that. And it looks like you got a lot of help from the house on this one, but well done. Thank you. Appreciate it. I yield the well. Hello, Senator, from the 26th. We've been missing you, babe. We glad you were with us. All right. Any other Senate will speak for against the measure. All right. The Senator has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on SB 125. All those in favor of the bill, but yeah, all opposed to any Secretary London machine. All in the motion to agree the A's are 37. The days are 14 and this motion has prevailed. Recognize Senator Turn the 21st. Mr. President, I move that the Senate agreed to the House substitute to SB 244. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 244 by Senator Beach. The 21st and others. The bill between Title IX to amend Article 11, Chapter 11, Title 17. The official George annotated what to adjourn provisions regarding the assessment of a payment of costs of criminal proceedings. So as to provide for the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs in criminal case to defend it upon such defendant making a successful motion to disqualify the prosecuting attorney from his conduct and connection with the case for procedures and assessing and paying such fees and costs for a ride for the later matters. The first ride for effective date, your appeal from the looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President House, I was following substitute to Senate bill 244. Bill Tumay, Title IX to amend Title 17 and 28 of the Fish Car George annotated what to adjourn the procedure of the General Assembly respectively. System and act provisions relating to certain criminal prosecutions are provided for the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs for a criminal case to defend it upon the qualification of the prosecuting attorney from his conduct and connection with the case and the subsequent dismissal of the case by the court. We're a subsequent prosecutor to ride for procedures for assessing and paying such fees and costs to allow for wrongful conviction and incarceration compensation claims and for other purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. I'm going to ask Senator on 21st. Thank you, Mr. President. I bring before you Senate bill 244 and this bill basically, what part one stays the same as it did when it left this chamber with a 55-nothing vote. And that basically is where prosecuting attorney, if that prosecuting attorney is disqualified for misconduct, prosecutorial or personal, and the case is then dismissed by the courts, and the folks that were indicted have an opportunity to recoup their attorney fees and reasonable cost. Part two was added in the House and it requires administrative law judges within the office of state administrative hearings to hear and evaluate claims of those that were convicted and then proven innocent through DNA testing and so on and they may have spent 20 years in jail. So that's what this does and it has these administrative law judges to establish compensation that may be awarded. They're going to have a wrongful conviction and incarceration compensation trust fund. Now let me tell you folks, that's subject to appropriations. That's what we do in the General Assembly is appropriate. So it is subject to appropriations. Victims, they must be innocent and proven innocent and then they can ask for compensation. Mr. President, if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. You do have one question. Greg and I are sitting from the 26th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Yeal? Yes. Senator? Did the Secretary of State record the gentleman in asking to change the vote? Did what? I said that the Secretary of State record the gentleman in asking to change the vote. I don't know who recorded it. I think it was recorded illegally out of the state of Florida by one of his employees but that hasn't. Listen, Senator. This has to do with a DA that had misconduct, personal misconduct. And now the case has been dismissed by the Court of Appeals. And if the Supreme Court dismisses it, you don't think those 15 defendants have some kind of right to get some compensation. So you think they have rights when they call and ask us to change the vote in the state of Georgia? Those 15 defendants didn't do that. You saying your president didn't do it? Listen, the president had every right to make a phone call and ask questions about that election. I asked questions about that election. A lot of us asked questions about that. They're president asked for votes. He didn't ask. He didn't say that. He had the idea. You heard the conversation. Had the Secretary of State not recorded, he would have lied on him. No. Well, that's not what this bill is about. This bill's not compensation. That's what it feels about. Senator Yeal? Senator Yeal did the well. Okay. This is my last time in the well. And I'd ask for a green vote. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the well. Recognize the center from the 29th. Colleagues, first of all, I want to thank the Senator from the 21st for his bill. I wasn't super warm about the bill when I first saw it. But there's some language added over in the House. Once again, held a subcommittee hearing on the appropriations compensation subcommittee as I was asked to. Got a lot of testimony. We do something a little different on the Senate side than they do across the way. When we have a hearing about legislation, we invite everybody in. All impacted parties. So when we talk about compensation for the wrongly convicted, we invite not only the individual who claims they were wrongly convicted, but we invite the district attorneys in. We invite the defense attorneys in. We do something really, really strange over here. We invite the families of the victims. Because I've yet to see a compensation request that did not involve the murder of a Georgia citizen. I want to be clear, these aren't stealing cars. These aren't robbing stores or burglarizing homes. These are killing other human beings. When I ran into this, my second year up here, when I voted for compensating two gentlemen out of Savannah, where a witness came back, the primary witness came back and said, I lied. And it was discovered that the district attorney in Savannah had purposely hidden discovery. Both of those acts are impediments to do process. And then in that same year, I voted to deny compensation from a gentleman in my district who drove the getaway car in an armored car robbery, where the armored car guard was assassinated as he was doing his job two days before Christmas in Columbus, Georgia. Because of a technicality, the case had been sent back to the district attorney who no longer had the witnesses she needed to prove the case. So she chose to not prosecute the case, reprasecute the case. No wrongdoing, nothing done erroneous by the trial court, nothing done erroneous or mischievous or any attempt to hide discovery or any witness perjured themselves. None of that. But I voted against it. And because I voted against it, I became somebody who does not appreciate justice, does not appreciate due process, and thinks that everybody arrested is guilty. And of course, those in this chamber that know me know that is not who I am. But one thing I did discover through this process is several years ago, a group of attorneys discovered a crack in the system. And that crack in the system was to go through the Secretary of State's office and tap into a process there that is used to make people whole when the state makes a mistake. And there's four attorneys, department heads or their representatives that serve on this board that makes those decisions. Now understand, we're talking about criminal law. We're talking about due process. These attorneys on this committee come from the Department of Transportation, Department of Health Services, Health and Human Services, and two other attorneys. And it's run by a young lady out of the Secretary of State's office who does an incredible job. But what I realize is the process is not a good process. So we've been working back and forth on trying to figure out what the process is, or we attempted to work back and forth on what the process is. But my friends across the home don't want our help, don't want my help, and figure out the process. So when we're here in a legislative session, they see an opportunity to tax something on that they think is the solution. And I'm going to tell you, part of the thing they tacked on is not a terrible thing. Another portion of it is very questionable, and it'll be decided if it's right or wrong. And so while I have and always will act in good faith as we move through the process, I'm going to ask you today to support the Senator from the 21st and vote for this legislation. And in the off season, we'll tackle the other thing that's attached to it, and we'll come up with a process that works. But I want to be perfectly clear on something. I'll listen to some compensation resolutions the other day. When looking at all the evidence, and this is 20 years down the road, one where an individual is already filed a 1983 action, so he wants two or three bites at the apple, another one where some people were in a gun battle. And as the person being sex trafficked was fleeing the scene, she was shot through the roof of a car in the head and killed. The person that shot at her, no matter the circumstances that they're out of prison, they murdered somebody. Another one where a gentleman and another guy were in a room by themselves, and the testimony of the person in the room was that the individual killed themselves playing Russian roulette with a gun that they accused and the convicted introduced into the scene. But we did something unusual in this too. We invited the victims' families there to talk to. We had trial transcripts there. We had one guy there who said he did not shoot a young man going down the road in his car, did not participate in the murder of a young man going down the road in his car. For a girl that they both were interested in. But amazingly, the transcripts from a phone call he made from prison may tell an entirely different story, where he calls that female, calls her horrific names, and threatens to kill her. So understand if anybody in this state is innocent and they're convicted, we should make sure that we take care of them. We should make sure they have due process, but we need to do it the right way. And we need to start remembering that for every crime there is, and there are 50,000 people in the Georgia Department of Corrections, which means there are thousands upon thousands, upon thousands of crime victims. If they are alive, walk into the streets of this state, looking for somebody to stand up for them. And we in this chamber are elected to represent 200,000 people. And I've told you before, if you need a kidney, I can give you one. The Senator from the 56, they've shown that. If you need corny as I, I got to do a little more to get you one of those. But anything that is transferable, I'll give you. But there's one thing I can't give you. That's a backbone. You either born with one, you either develop one, or life's going to be tough on you. Work this bill, get it across, and I promise you the fight's not over. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the will. Thank you, Senator. Senator from 38. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I want to thank the House for sending this bill back. So I, as a Fulton County Senator, can correct the record in my position on this. This bill does nothing more than force Fulton County to pay for Donald Trump's legal fees. Mind you, this is the case in which Trump spent millions of dollars, of course. So if this bill passes, my constituents will have to bear the cost of paying his legal fees. As my colleague from the 26, very eloquently said during the line of questioning, the reason why this case was even bought was Donald Trump called our Secretary of State and asked to find 11,779 votes. This bill is just another opportunity for this body to try to attack the prosecuting attorney in this case for having the guts to bring a case forward on someone that was breaking the law, even if that someone was the president of the United States. In addition to that, our members of the majority party talk about the responsible use of tax dollars. But a bill like this has been put forward that does nothing but direct our tax dollars away from Georgia. As a Senator that represents citizens of Fulton County, we should not be paying Donald Trump's legal fees for trying to break the law in this state. I understand some people are have allegiance to the president and some people voted for him. And that is your right. But do not force my constituents to pay his legal fees and those who tried to break the law along with him, including folks that were sent here by Kanye West, we should not be paying for their legal fees. And so I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill because we should not be paying for a billionaire's legal fees. And so Mr. President, I would yield but I strongly urge and remind folks that we have folks in this state that are struggling. And their tax dollars, hard work in tax dollars, should not be sent to Marilago as a result of anything that happens with this case. They should fight this case in the court of law and not by making constituents that had nothing to do with anything that was done, make them pay for anything that happened when a phone call was made. And so with that Mr. President, I yield the will. Mr. President, from the 55th. Thank you Mr. President. And I am so honored to have another chance. I voted for this bill the last time because I was told I missed under the bill. I understood the implications of an amendment that did not get done. And this bill, as I understand it, is as the Senate of the 38th, so eloquently just stated, it is already a bill to compensate someone who made a call. So I made their call. If I made their call, I would be under the jail. And the key would be thrown away. And in this country, it does appear that some can be above the law. You can grapple a woman on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. You can have 34 felonies. And there are people that cannot vote because they are felons. It's not right. If we're going to have two standards, we cannot be the beacon of democracy to these other countries. And I simply stand today because it's my understanding that you can correct me if I am mistaken, that there's already been an adjudication that somebody has been disqualified due to improper conduct in the part of a prosecuting attorney. So there's already, by the passage of this bill, it is giving away money to the person who said, let me have 7,11,700, just to state it. It was my understanding, 11,780. It may be 11,779. But at any rate, this bill says, and I actually would support this bill, if you would support an amendment, even the gentleman from the 21st, if this bill said, and there is a proximate causation of the guilt or innocence of that person who is accused. If it is found that the misconduct of that attorney caused the guilt of that person that was accused, I would support it. They should be praised if there was a misconduct that caused it. But if this woman slept with someone, it had nothing to do with the guilt or innocent of the person that we are talking about in this institution. And this is very unpleasant for me to stand here, but someone has got to say, when the king doesn't have any clothes on, and we keep telling him that he does, this bill, thank you for the opportunity to vote knowing this bill. I'm going to leave it at that. Because I do put a poison pill in it. People who have been in jail for 20 years, and it's found that people are hiding evidence or did some misconduct on the part of the prosecutor's attorney, they should be compensated, and there should be some avenue to do that in a reasonable manner. But when it has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence, there should be some proximate causation. And as my understanding that the defense team had people sleeping with each other, but it had nothing to do with the guilt or innocent of the client. It's just totally irrelevant. And we've gone another whole level to find that that had anything to do with it. But Mr. President, I do yield the well. And if we want to give someone money and run on some political campaign to say that someone was found that this would have something to do with someone asking for 11,780 votes, it's just a very big disconnect. Thank you for allowing me to have this opportunity to speak that I will use. And Mr. President, I will now yield the well. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Any other senator wish to speak for against the measures? Senator from the 36, what purpose do you rise? I'd like to ask unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 35th and the senator from the 22nd for business inside the capital. Without objection, the senator from the 35th and 22nd are excused. All right. Question is on.

The Senate from the 21st has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate bill 244. All those in favor vote, yay, all opposed, nay, Secretary Hanlonk, the machine. On the Senator's motion to agree to the House substitute on Senate bill 244, the count is, yay, the 35, the nays are 18, and so this motion has prevailed. Senator, the 21st, what purpose do you rise? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to immediately transmit SB244 to the governor. On day 40, it is automatically Senator. Does it? Okay. Recognize the majority leader for motion. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agreed to the House substitute to Senate bill 291. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 291 by Senator Griechler, the 51st and others, bill 292, men, code section 4-2-861-1 of the official go to George N. T. A. A. will like to light special license plates from learning or sporting certain where the agencies are not proper corporations and qualified motor vehicles or drivers with proceeds to positive and to general funds that are established in America for a specialty license plate to ride for conditions for the production of such license plates to ride for discontinuing the manufacturer such license plates in certain instances to ride for the deposition of funds and to the general fund to ride for a later matter, to ride for effective dates or bill of the looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, thank you. Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate bill 291 to build some intent on act to men, because section 4-2-861-1 of the official go to George N. T. A. will like to especially lighten the slate, sporting a sporting where the agencies fund non-progress corporations and qualified motor vehicles or drivers with proceeds to positive and to general funds to establish an American for a specialty license plate to ride for conditions for the production of such license plates and for other purposes with a speciality license that completes the order. Mr. President, thank you. Mr. President, colleagues, Senate bill 291, we passed just a few weeks ago. It creates a specialty license plate. It had two parts to the bill when it left here and it's coming back with only one section remaining. The part that the House removed was the part of the bill that dealt with the organ donors that the senator from the 56 had attached to it. That portion is no longer on this bill. It only applies now to the part of the plate with the American flag and the words America first at the bottom. Mr. President, I'll yield for questions or I'll yield the well. We only need a simple majority on this bill, so please vote for the bill. You have no questions. Mr. President, I recognize senator from the 14. Thank you, Mr. President. No amendments this time, just facts. America first is a phrase that dates back 100 years. We mentioned this before. To a time when reactionary right wing forces used forces of xenophobia, racism, to privilege, not just America, but a certain class of Americans, above all else, and to be distrustful of people who are different from us. This is not an abstract philosophical matter. We are seeing it happen today. Or we could talk about Wednesday, which was officially liberation day. We talked about that was Trump's phrase for the day when tariffs took effect. How much is the Dow Jones down today? Is anybody checked? Is anybody checked their own stocks? We're down I think 7% something like that on the week. We're down 10% in some cases I think on the year. That's what happens when you say America first and what you really mean is destructive impulses, other rising, our traditional allies, taking positions that we would rather destroy ourselves than be friends with others. That's what America first means when Donald Trump is saying it. And that's what America first means if we put it on a license plate. Mr. President, I yield the well. Any other Senate which speak for against the manager? Senator from the 37th. Mr. President, I reject the arguments of the Senate from the 14th. This is not about some sorted history of the words quote America first unquote that dates back to the 20s and 30s. This is a simple question. This is a question that many Americans believe that America is an exceptional place and that American interests need to be recognized that working people across this country who put in 55 hour weeks sometimes that over time, raising families, running businesses, paying taxes, believe that our government at the local, state and national level needs to look after Americans first as opposed to spending money on overseas entanglements that have cost trillions of dollars in many lives in blood and treasure. Now there can be wide debate about the wisdom of that. There can be wide debate about many of our foreign engagements or the engagements or their projections of our values and principles or they simply costly entanglements. Legislatures debate those things. So what's before us today is a proposition that folks believe that America is a special place, that America is a place worth protecting, that American values, which have shaped the entire world, that have been a beacon for the rest of the world or worthy of protecting, worthy of lifting up, that American people working folks across our nation, their values are worth protecting and has nothing to do. This proposition I would can see, I would tell you, with words of sorted movements from the 20s and 30s as a Senate from the 14th suggests, with that urge or support. Senators yielding, the Senate wishes to speak for against this measure. All right, the Senate from the 50th first has moved that the Senate agrees that the House is substitute on SB 291. All those in favor vote, yay, I'll pose nay, Secretary and Lampemachine. All in the motion, the yeas are 33 and the nays are 21 and this motion has prevailed. Secretary, Senate Bill 331. Senator from the 45th, you make a motion for them please. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute to SB 331. Senator Bill 331, by certain bicks on the 45th and others, we intend to appeal an act creating and establishing a joint air port authority for the City of Winder and County of Barrow approved March 25th, 1958 as amended, particularly by an act approved March 28th, 1986 and an act approved March 16th, 1989 to provide for the assets and liabilities that are up to repeal public and laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House offers following substitute to Senate Bill 331, a bill to be intended not to repeal and act establishing and us creating a joint air port authority for the City of Winder and County of Barrow approved March 25th, 1958 as amended, particularly by an act approved March 28th, 1986 and an act approved March 16th, 1989 to provide for legislative purpose to write for the assets and liabilities thereof and for other purposes. Mr. President, the complete steward. We're going to have Senator from the 45th. Thank you, Mr. President. SB 331, it is a local bill, but it doesn't have to do with anything with Gwyneth or Mulberry. I know the Senator from the night would be happy to hear that. This has to do with, it's purely a local bill, it has to do with Barrow County and their air port authority. They're dissolving it where the County Commission will take back over the airport to do improvements. There was one change where the property and the leases would not transfer until the authority is dissolved and that's all that does, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. Senator Yewder, does the Senator wish to speak for against measure? Here's the Senator's move that the Senate agreed to the House substitute. All those in favor, will vote ye. I'll oppose nay, secretary and lot of machine. On the motion, the ye is 51 and the nays are zero and this motion has prevailed. We're going to have Senator from the six. Mr. President, I move that the Senate agreed to the House substitute to SB 193. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 193 by Senator Brass of the six and others, bill between 10 and act to men. Chapter 4, title 20, the fiscal Georgia Anteo, to location of technical and adult education. Justice of the state board and technical college system of Georgia. To establish the adult workforce high school diploma program, try for selection of third party providers. So your minister of program, to write for requirements for approved program providers, to write for disbursement of funds, to approve program providers, to write for reporting, to write for definition, to write for relief matters. For people looking at lots and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House Office of the Longest Subitone Senate bill 193, you vote to the title act to men. Chapter 4, title 20, the CGA, billy to vocational technical and adult education. So it's the authority to state board of the technical college system of Georgia to establish the adult workforce high school diploma program, to write for selection of third party providers. To administer the program, to write for requirements for the approved program providers, to write for disbursement of funds, to approve program providers, and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I'm bringing that as the Senator from the six. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, this is our workforce development bill. It does the ages 21, 340, allows them to go back and get their high school diploma. Only change made in the House is, if you look on line 170, I know all your real tentative right now, you'll see that we put in a repeal date, a sunset of July 1, 2031. The purpose of that was to get us in line with TCSG in their program. I know y'all got lots of questions, so you'll have no question, Senator. All right, I'll urge your federal consideration of SB 191. Any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? All right, hearing none. The Senator's move that the Senator agreed to the House substitute on SB 193. All those in favor of vote, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary and lamp machine. All in the motion to agree the a's are 50 and the a's are one and this motion has prevailed. Moving on to recognize the Senator from the 29th. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the amended SB 99 from the House. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 99 by Senator Robertson of the 29th and others, the bill is being done in act to amend Couts Action 16-1-3. The official Georgia annotated with the definitions of the crimes and offenses, so that's a right for definition of the law enforcement officer to write for a later matters to be able to look in laws and for other purposes. Mr. President of the House, Office of the following, so the Senate bill 99, the bill to be done in act to amend Couts Action 16-1-3 and 17-4-20. The OCGA will add to definitions, relative crimes and offenses and authorization of arrests with the with and without ones generally, use of deadly force, adoption of promulgation of conflicting regulations, policies, ordinances and resolutions and authority of the power facility security officer respectively. So it's the right for definition of law enforcement officer and for other purposes. So it's the president that completes the order. We're going to send it from the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it. I made the motion that we agree to the House substitute of SB 99. This piece of legislation just clears up the definition of law enforcement officer so that anytime we have assistance from federal law enforcement officers, they are covered and they are, they have the jurisdictional ability to assist Georgia law enforcement officers and also to react if they see a violent crime being committed. And if there are not any questions, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. You do have one question, Senator. I'm going to have the senator from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. With the center of yield. I will yield. You said agreed to the House substitute as amended, right? I said I moved that the senator agreed to the House substitute of SB 99. Okay, you're just agreeing to the House substitute not as amended. Correct. Questions, Senator. Thank you. I appreciate your support. The senator has moved that the senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate bill 99. All those in favor vote, yay. I'll oppose, nay, secretary, and law and the sheen. The A's are 50 and the A's are 3 and this motion has prevailed. Recognize, Senator from 31st. Mr. President, I move that the senate agreed to the House substitute to SB 105. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 105, by Senator Anvatar, to the 31st and others, the bill has been telling 9 to men, chapter 50, title 43, the official George Ante, will lead to veterinarians and veterinary technicians. So, it's authorized license veterinarians and veterinarians to practice veterinary tele-advised. To authorize license veterinarians and veterinary technicians to practice veterinary tele-triage on certain circumstances. So, authorize license veterinarians to practice veterinary telemedicine under certain circumstances. And for other purposes, Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate bill 105. The ultimate title 9 to men, chapter 50, title 43. Those should be able to vet an errands of veterinarian technician so it's to authorize license veterinarians of veterinary technicians to practice veterinary tele-advised and to authorize license veterinarians and veterinary technicians to practice veterinary tele-triage on certain circumstances. To authorize license veterinarians to practice veterinary telemedicine or certain circumstances to either for regulation or for the practice of veterinary tele-medicine and for other purposes. Mr. President, I please see you in the morning. Are you going to send from 31st? Thank you, Mr. President. If you remember Senate Bill 105, we passed through this body overwhelmingly. Basically, it protects our veterinarians in the telehealth business for large and small animals and rural and urban areas. The only addition the house made was basically to allow veterinarians to have it attended for and vet schools to practice in Georgia in their area specialty. Only while they are waiting a licenter from the state of Georgia. I'm Mr. President. I'll yield for questions. You do have one question. Is your seat made? Well, recognize the center for the 30th. Let's jump in, Yield. Sure. So you're saying that we're going to allow them to practice before they get their license? Correct. Is that a good idea? I mean, it's really no different than having somebody while they're in school basically shadowing the local vet as they're waiting on a license and working in the office. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. No further questions, Senator. Great question. Ask for green on this bill. Thank you, Mr. President. Any other senator wants to speak forward against it? All right. The senator has moved that the senate agreed to the House substitute on the Senate Bill 105. All those in favor of the A.I.O.P.O.s. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. All in the motion, the A's are 51 and A's are 1, so this motion prevails. We recognize the center for the 29th. Mr. President, I move the senate agreed to the House substitute on SB 298. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 298, Senator Roberts, Senate 29. The bill is being done to amend Code Section 5-6. There's 34 of the official George Ante, who are two judgments and rulings deemed directly appealable procedure for review of judgements orders of decision. Subject direct appeal scope of review hearings of criminal cases involving capital offense, which that's penalty is sought and appeals involving non-meditary judgements and child custody cases, which are for certain appellate procedures regarding the denial of sovereign and other immunity available to state or city and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 298. The bill is being done to amend Code Section 5-6. There's 34 of the OCDA, which are judgments and rulings deemed directly appealable. Procedure for review of judgements orders of decision is not subject to direct appeal, scope of review hearings and criminal cases involving capital offense, which that's penalty is sought and appeals involving non-meditary judgements and child custody cases of the right for certain appellate procedures and for other purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. We're going to have the Senator for the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, you've heard this bill before we passed it out. Basically, what it deals with is direct appeals on all judgements, orders of rulings and several actions, granting or denying or refusing to grant or not immunity to one or more parties based upon sovereign municipal, official, qualified or judicial immunity. So in other words, what this does is if your city comes out and claims sovereign immunity and the court denies that sovereign immunity, currently they have to wait to the end of the trial to appeal that judge's ruling. Now they can do it on the front end. They get one opportunity to do it. If it's upheld, then the case moves forward. If it's, or excuse me, if it's denied, the case moves forward. And if it's upheld, then the case stops there. Currently right now, we're spending a lot of time of money on discovery, on cases where once the appeal is heard at the end of the trial, the appeal is granted and all that effort was put in for nothing. I certainly do hope you support Senate Bill 298. And with that, Mr. President, I'll yield the well unless there are any questions. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you. Any other Senator would speak for it against it? Hearing none. So the Senator has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate Bill 298. All those in favor of vote. Yay, I'll pose nay. Secretary, I'm not the machine. I'll hold the motion to agree the a's are 44 and the a's are eight and this motion has prevailed. Reganada, Senator from the 32nd. Senator from the 32nd. Mr. President, I'm moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute for Senate Bill 5. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 5 by Senator Korp-Messor, the 32nd and others, the bill is being tunneled act to amend chapter 46 and thought of 33. The fiscal Georgia annotated with two certification of prior review agents. So I survived that, help them to ensure to implement a maintained program that allows for a selective application of reductions of prior authorization requirements under certain circumstances. To arrive for an annual filing, to arrive for the promulgation of rules and regulations, prior for related matters, prior for effective date and applicability to appeal to the looking laws and further purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the long substitute to Senate Bill 5. It builds a maintained act to amend chapter 46. It's out of 33. The fiscal Georgia annotated with a two certification of prior review agents. So I survived for health insurance, implement and maintain a program that allows for a selective application of reductions of prior authorization requirements under certain circumstances. To arrive for an annual filing, to arrive for the promulgation of rules and regulations. To amend chapter 24, title 33, chapter 18, title 45 of those that G.A. I'm going to encourage generally employees insurance and benefits plans respectively. So I was to require coverage for healthier services for pediatric autoimmune neuro, psychiatric disorders associated with stroke, vocal infection pandas, and pediatric acute onset neuro psychiatric syndrome pans. And, according to it, it would naturally recognize client clinical practice guidelines of other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to assume for 30 seconds. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill started as the prior authorization bill that we've seen a number of times now.

We have a very bad insurance coverage for a rare disease, actually two rare diseases called pans and pandas that are basically something that happens after a strep infection. It follows clinically recognized practice guidelines and it does not include IVG. I'd be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions, Senator. I'm Daniel Senator, which speak for it against it. All right. The senator has moved that the senator agreed to the House substitute on SP5, all those in favor vote yea, all opposed nay, secretary, lump machine. Thanks, senator. The senator has moved that the senator agreed to the House to substitute on SP5. I don't have these on. I don't think they're going to be here. I don't agree. The eggs are a feature tune, the nays are zero, and this bill has prevailed. Stand by first, I get a senator from 25, just stand by.
