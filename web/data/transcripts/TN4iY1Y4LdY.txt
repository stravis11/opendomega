All right, y'all, so we're actually, I'm going to call us into standing committee.
So Senator Dixon, for your education, we have a standing committee which falls under
normal rules of any committee.
So we can amend and standing committee bill comes out of here.
It goes to the floor and it gets reported out of committee.
And once it does that, then it goes to the general calendar to where we can make it available
or not and then select it or not.
So that's just kind of a little lesson for you today.
And you being new, you don't get a name plate today.
You have to earn a name plate.
So we'll see how you do today.
If you do good, you'll have a name plate next time.
Okay.
So in standing committee again, we ran out of time last year, we only had 40 days to
do the good work of this state and sometimes it's just not enough and so I do have about
I don't know, 15 or so bills and standing committee and so I decided we're going to try
to clean that up and Senator James, tell you what while you're here, you can have that
right there because we are going to start with SB 151 and if you need a copy this just
a quick reminder is your designating September 11th as first responders appreciation day.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members.
I was approached by first responders of Fulton County and Douglas County in Cobb to since
they celebrate September 11th as first responders day in their counties to make it a statewide
celebration because other first responders are also working and doing things in the
on 9-11. Okay. So I brought this forward last year and if we didn't get a chance to
pass it, but they still celebrated it September 11th and now they wanted to know if we could
still make this a recognition all over the state of Georgia. Absolutely. I ask for your
favorable consideration. Okay, are there any questions from the committee? All right.
Well, most of the will of the committee, I got a motion due pass from my vice chairman.
I got a second from the president, pro-team, all in favor say aye, all opposed same sign.
I skip the discussion part, anybody have any discussion, I want to be full transparency
here.
Okay.
Sinner yep bill will go on the rules. Thank you, sir. It will go from rules to rules
Thank you very much for your chairman and members. Okay. Thank you very much. I move out of y'all away with my noise
Hey, you took the beeper off
Oh
He might have earned my vote for Congress
No kid nobody endorse him now
all right good deal moving on all right we've got S R 122 from the dean of the
Senate and I he asked me to actually cover that for him and seems I can find it
I will cover it for you want to do it yeah Senator let's you go for it what
Number you, I can't see you all's numbers.
I'm gonna tell you what 12, get a microphone please.
Number 12, I'm gonna tell you what the bill does
and I'll let Maverick sing the lyrics.
It designates the song The Veteran Anthem
with lyrics and music by Mr. Swan
as the official song of Georgia Service members,
veterans and their families.
So it's a theme song.
are you going you're going are you going to sing with me if you're not going to
sing with me the words are in the bill you read the bill I was trying not to

questions from the committee for our Senate non-sponsor okay no questions
So you did a fine job there.
Thank you, Senator.
Proud of you.
All right, what's the will of the committee?
I got a motion due pass from the minority leader.
I got a second from the minority will.
Any discussion?
All in favor say aye.
All opposed, same side.
Motion passes, unanimous.
Okay, moving on.
We got Senate Resolution 203 from Senator Jones of the 10th.
He's not here.
I don't think he was here at all today.
Was you Senator Jones from the 22nd,
you want to cover that for him?
Yes, sir, Mr. Chair,
this is apparently just a study committee
to talk about a safe firearm storage.
No restrictions on firearm,
just a study how to store firearms
for the safety of our children.
Okay, I know we got a couple of bills going around this year around storage, so is there
any questions from the committee?
Senator Doe's all.
Can I get some clarity on the who's estimated the 5.4 million Americans that's referenced
in line four?
I would be able to answer that one.
It's not your bill.
I apologize.
That's fair.
Any other questions for the non-author?
Senator Roberts.
Inquiry to the chair if possible.
Is it possible that we could have the author of the bill here and discuss this bill?
I know there's been a lot of emphasis on this and there's a lot of programs being stood up.
it up and I don't know if we necessarily need to use taxpayer resources on study
committees. So I'll just love to ask some questions about it. Okay, is that a
motion? Yes, sir. I would make that motion. Motion to table does take
precedence. Yes, sir. I got a motion to table from Senator Robertson motion in a
second from Senator Dolezal. All in favor say aye. All opposed. All right. Bill
table. Thank you Mr. Chair. No problem just back up standing committee. Okay Senator Jones
of the 22nd we've got SR 323. Yes sir Mr. Chairman this is a dress and
issue that unfortunately all of us will face at some point in time and that's
dealing with family caregiving services and it's just to make a determination
if this state has any rules or restrictions that are out there the
But we help alleviate some persons can take care of their loved ones and family caregiver situations
When they have to work another issue such as that. It's one that we're all going to basically face with our parents to maybe with ourselves
Okay
And if we're going to take action on this bill we will need to
Amin lines 59
Changing the year from 2023 to 2024
or would you agree to that?
I would agree with that, Miss Sheeran,
make motion to that effect.
Any questions about the underlying bill?
All right, what's the will of the committee?
I got a motion from Senator Robertson to pass.
I got a second from Senator Anderson.
We need to make that a amendment.
I make a motion to amend, I believe it's line 59
to 2024, Mr. Chair.
Okay, so we're gonna strike through the number three
on line 59 and replace it with the number four.
I've got a motion for that amendment,
and I've got a second.
From center.
I got a motion from center albers,
second from the minority leader.
No, I'm sorry, I got a motion from
Senator Jones, second from center albers.
All in favor say aye.
All opposed same amendment passes all right now to SR 323 as amended I've got a
motion to pass all in favor any discussion all in favor say aye all opposed same
sign. Motion passes unanimous. Good job. Okay. We've got SR 344. Senator Ann
Bhattardi is our sponsor but I believe Senator Dixon are you that I understand
you're presenting this? Yes, sir, Mr. Chair. All right. Just rolls in the rules for
the first time with his own resolution.
Yes, Senate resolution 344, it would
designate, which we will have to amend this.
It will designate May 1, 2024 with change.
A men line, 24 to change the date on it.
I believe you got a date on the back as well.
There's a date on the back as well.
Oh, is there a need to be a men's job?
You got to hit them, so.
You know, I'm proud of him and I read a bill.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, I got a question.
Where in the world did you come up with this idea?
This was not my idea, Mr. Chairman.
I know.
I'm going to just to pile level for you.
Very high level.
Pure bread, dog day.
Okay.
So what about the muts out there?
We just going to throw them under the bus?
Or did they have their own day?
Well, Senator Anderson, you could create the unpear bread dog day if you choose.
You know what?
Every dog loves it.
I would bet.
We have that already.
Somewhere in code.
All right.
Any other questions?
I got Senator Robertson.
Senator Dickson.
What number are you there?
What number are you?
Please, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Dickson, I think you're familiar with my daughter.
She's a four-year-old beautiful, small for her age child, and she spends a great part
of her day with her mixed breed, wolf hound, and other dogs.
Are you trying to lessen her experience of love by having her dog who is not a pure
bread, by segregating her dog into a lesser group with your legislation?
Not at all, Mr. Whip.
I'd be happy to look at legislation that would create the unpear bread dog day if that
would help.
More importantly, would you be willing to sit down to my daughter and tell her that
you're not the monster that this bill makes you out to me?
Didn't Teresa text you that question to ask?
Yes, or I had the interpreter on my phone so it converged in English so I could ask.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I think we had another question, Senator Telsaw.
The other way, hold on, Senator Dixon, would you like to address the question?
Yes, we'd be happy to sit down with her.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Senator Douglas Hall.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Dixon, can you please define for the committee some terms I'm seeing on lines
9 and 10, conservation dogs and on line 10, earth dogs.
Oh, good question.
I would have to defer that to Senator Anivatar, see if you might answer that.
There is your bill, Senator Amertari, you are the sponsor.
But he's not the one we got.
I mean, I see him all dogs are on earth.
Okay.
I do have one question for Senator Dickson.
Even though I'm on my field.
Do you own a dog?
I do.
I own two dogs.
What kind of dogs?
One's a purebred lab, and then I've got a actually a golden doodle, so it makes it very, very, very fair across the board.
So how's your golden doodle going to fill about this resolution?
We had a conversation this morning before I left the house. She was a little upset, but she understood.
She was okay with it by the time we left.
I might get her some counseling when I get home for this weekend or something.
Okay, there's something to do.
Mr. Chairman, the prototype of the makeup motion.
We're getting sideways. I think now would be a great time.
time. Mr. Chairman, make a motion. We adopt Senate resolution 344 with the amended changes
at Senator Dixon. I got a motion of D pass for Senate resolution 344. I need a motion
for the amending lines one, changing the 3204 and on line 24, changing the 3204. I need
motion. I've got a motion from Senator Watt sent on the amendment. Do I have a second from
Senator Albers? All in favor of the amendment? Say aye. No, same sign. All right, we're good to go.
All right, so we've got a motion for Senate resolution 344 as amended. All in favor say aye.
All right, all opposed say yeah, we are ahead of center Alvers second. All opposed say
me. All right motion passes unanimous those will go to the floor and then to the general
calendar from there. So all right, we are going to the adjourn out of standing committee and
And we are going to, that's the word, again, Senate rules.
Convene!
Thank you.
See, that's why I got a vice chairman.
Keep me straight.
Mercedes, you failed me.
You're trying to think of the English word, though, aren't you?
What is it in Spanish?
Convene.
Comensa.
Comensa.
What is it in Italian?
Initiana.
Initiana, da-da-da-da.
I had the pan-fried meal last night. It was delicious.
Okay. Now, on.
Rules for consider or I'm sorry bills for consideration.
You will see on your sheet, your yellow sheet.
We have HP571,
which we are going to have chairman Watson.
Would you please present that for us?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
What numbers?
It says 1.
Witness 1.
W1.
Got it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Bill 571 passed my committee, HHS, last year, came to rules and did not make it
to the floor.
It was recommitted.
And the instruction of the leader, we took up business and passed that out.
Wednesday, and this bill basically changes the update from three years to four years.
That's the full update, but every two years, we'll get statistics and data relating to
Alzheimer's and dementia in the state of Georgia.
This is through GARD, G-A-R-D, Georgia Alzheimer's-related dementia, that meets, I'm a member
of that and we meet every quarter and that has been instrumental in relating to recognition,
defining Alzheimer's and dementia in the state of Georgia which as you know is increasing
the numbers and also has been helping with recognition and treatment and clinics in conjunction
with Emory throughout the state.
But all this does is change the updates and changes the dates in there, that's all it
does.
I'd be happy to entertain any questions.
I'm just glad to know people are listening to the leader when he said get your bills moving.
It's been a lot of that going around.
He did. He did. He gets a A-plus, doesn't he?
So you get legislative of the week award, maybe? He's in the running.
He's in the running. Okay. Any questions from the committee?
No.
Hold on. We got to pick it first.
can I pick it? Oh sure it's going to count as a pick. My vice chairman would like the
first pick of the 2024 rules committee. Can I see if we can pass HPE 571? We've got
a pick from the vice chairman again. Okay. Let me go through all the bills that are
going to be on the calendar for my name. I've got HB 571. That's all. I got a motion from
center now. Discussion question. Go ahead. I just point a clarification. Any dog that
has the habit of putting their face into the ground and coming up with another creature,
squirrel rat a mouse or anything else is an earth dog yes sir what about their
own their own mess no sir it has to be another living breathing animal that they
come up with in their mouth what if there's a worm in the mess I think we're
getting into biology there and I'm gonna argue that with you just curious all right
Well, let's stay on topic.
Thank you.
All right.
So they're here in motion to get this to the floor.
I got a motion from Senator Alvers.
Second from Senator Anna Vitarte.
Any discussion?
All in favor, say aye.
All opposed.
Same sign.
Motion passed as unanimous.
