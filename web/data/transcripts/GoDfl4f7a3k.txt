TRANSCRIPT
----------
All we're looking for is simply a level playing field,
meaning when a female athlete steps on the playing field,
that there is no advantage other than fair and clean competition.
We had clergy speak against SB1.
We had parents of transgender children speak against SB1.
Not a single coach, not a single athletic organization,
not a one, zero, which, incidentally, is the amount of transgender students competing
in K through 12 sports in Georgia, zero.
