Before we do we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 60th House District Representative Mandisha Thomas. Representative Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To God be the glory greetings to my colleagues I rise today to introduce and bring to you a true man of God. He originally hails from white planes New York who now has lived in South Fulton for over 40 years. He is a senior pastor at Trinity Fellowship Church of Atlanta and because I love giving gifts and giving to others I have chosen to bring past the reason before this body on the best day in the world. And the greatest day in the world February 11th the day that the Lord released me to this earth. Yes today is my birthday. Thank you. Thank you. Over the years I have watched and learned the mighty community work that this man has accomplished. I have personally witnessed Pastor Reeves stand before the Word of God without wavering to any actions of any mankind. Pastor Reeves strikes me because he serves the least of these. His ministry affects the people who are most vulnerable, the homeless. When COVID-19 hit the nation his ministry went virtual. Some 74 year olds may find that hard to do but Pastor Reeves is on it. Colleagues there is some serious issues that are at the forefront of our nation and we as legislators have been elected to curve as much as we can for the state of Georgia. So today I bring to you five minutes of encouragement which I pray will feed your soul and continue to inspire you to do the work that we are called to do. I pray that you are the best of all. Pastor Lawrence A. Reeves Jr. Thank you so much. God bless you. God bless you. It's a privilege and honor for me to be before you today. Amen. Praise God. God is so good to us. I don't know what I can do in five minutes but we'll try. Amen. That's okay. That we will try. It's going to be very difficult to be able to do this. To speaker lost in the supply should honor to be here with you today to representative Mandisha Thomas for your invitation. It is absolutely wonderful. And to this great body of the Georgia House of Representatives I am truly humbled and honored to be your chaplain for today. I am grateful that my children and son-in-law are here with me today. Dr. Lawrence A. Reeves III Dr. Kia and Theodore Brunson and Councilman Corey Reeves from the fifth district of the city of South Fulton where I reside. And so today that I would like if I could to briefly give you a word that I think hopefully that will bless you in the few minutes that I have. And I just want to just open with a quick prayer before we pray later. Father, we thank you so much for the day. I thank you for the privilege and the honor for me to be here before your people, your leader's God. And so God, I pray for the God that you would not need to speak for the God that that what you would have me to speak for the God. And so God, we thank you in Jesus name that we pray amen amen. Today that I would like to do for you is to give you a snapshot of biblical leadership. I define biblical leadership as simply serving those that you have responsibility over. I only have five minutes again as I said this topic is a powerful topic and very meaningful for anyone in leadership. First, I want to thank each of you for your leadership roles in our great state. Your responsibilities are awesome and lonely more times than not many do not understand no sense the depth of your responsibilities. Our nation Georgia, our counties and local municipalities are suffering with the COVID pandemic. Our economy is shaking in many ways. Our economy is unemployment is devastating major concerns about schools and we see stress on and overtaken a large number of Georgia citizens. Our churches many are zooming and others meet with a variety of augmented schedules. We ever need a time to see leaders that fear God. Leaders that fear God. It is now great leaders deeply care about the people under their leadership. They hear the hearts of the people and they have a passionate desire to want to solve their problems. But I want to share with you briefly about such a leader from the biblical tech Solomon was the wisest man that had ever lived a walk through the book of Proverbs will confirm that claim. In my elucidation of the greatest attributes of a leader are that of being humble having a servant heart and loving God. Solomon knew that his father wanted to build a house to honor the name of God. But God saw David's heart and was pleased. God told David that he did not want him to build a house but his seeds Solomon. Solomon growing up in his father's David's house witnessed firsthand the love and adoration that his father David had forgot. He saw that God had appointed him to be the king over Israel. I am confident that David told the story to Solomon many times that he was going to be the king of Israel and that he was to build a house to honor the name of God. Solomon understanding the magnitude of this lesson built the house to honor God but he didn't just stop there. Upon the completion of the house to honor the name of God Solomon the leader. He demonstrated that the character of Godly leadership. He said the following the second Chronicles 6, 12 and 14 and he stood before the altar of God of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands. Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of the five cubics and five cubics long and five cubics broad and these cubics high and had sent it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and said, oh Lord God of Israel there is no God like thee in the heaven. Nor in the earth which keeps covenant and shows mercy unto the servants that it walked before the with all their hearts as Solomon kneeled, praising the Lord for being the creator and the sovereign God of all. Races hands to God who had blessed not just him but the entire congregation of Israel. It would be good if we were have such a public display of humility to a sovereign God we need our in our public square. Leaders leading is in prayer. We have the church leaders but however a public display for a call to prayer brought by our leaders is no worthy my brothers and sisters. We have the church leaders just we do not sense this pandemic have we had such a call to prayer and as Solomon the wisest leader did as Solomon was meditating and night upon his bed God spoke to him and said in second chronicles 714 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and say. I hear from heaven and will forgive this and will yield their land leadership is hard biblical leadership is even harder however when we pray the results are awesome you the great leaders of Georgia as you are praying and meditating before the sovereign God and waiting in silence upon your bed let God speak to you. So that you can speak to the people in this critical time the people need to hear from you in this great assembly today the people are watching and waiting as you lay in your beds at night I trust that you will meditate on your call and listen to the hearts of the people for they are speaking loudly the heart beats of the people from Thomasville Bainbridge. Balda Clinton's state so there all over Georgia the eight weeks of tree call for Mar cream cheese and a group call toicken her a Texas mountain temple on the bay bridge well daced of bleakly or pity dot and to koakandy some veneer there speaks in hands of these populations the adhyns Colombia's cucumber palsil and all the hearts beat from the other citizens towns all over Georgia. for you. We wait desperately for your call. My brothers and sisters. Now if you will stand and let us pray. Most worship for God. I humbly approach your Heavenly throne today to supplicate for all the elected representatives in this house and to all the staff that see after the people's business. My father I would ask that you will grant our leaders the wisdom and knowledge that will help them to deliberate peacefully and have peaceful resolutions as they seek to improve the lives of the citizens of Georgia. I ask that you grant servant leadership where it is needed and that it will be the standard of this house and that they will be bold in seeking you for the difficult issues that lead to peaceful resolve. Most holy God as we continue this fight with this in this ungodly pandemic we ask for strength for our economic issues and unemployment our Georgia student teachers families and hospital workers and all the essential workers who dare to be on the front line the public safety personnel and the people of Georgia for sure they are the burdens that lie on the heart of each of you leaders in this chamber finally most holy God give us the love for one another that will be felt all over Georgia North South East and West. I pray that you would have turned and you would turn your ear to our prayer today. We your people God bless you and now let us have our pledge allegiance to the flag. Our pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States, America, in Republic which is stand one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay.

Dental hygienists are giving care to patients not only in dental offices across our state, but in our schools and in our public health clinics to our most vulnerable citizens. So they are delivering a little gift to you instead of us giving them a gift for all they do to make sure that Georgians have good oral health and you will find that in your offices when you return to your office. So when you see your dental hygienist next or one comes down on an issue, please tell them thank you for all they do to help Georgians maintain good oral health, which is essential to good health in general. So once again, it's Georgian dental hygienist appreciation day and with that Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well.

He was a graduate of Jenkins County school system, a 49 graduate of Fort Valley State University with a degree in chemistry and physics, a master's of science degree from New York State University. He moved to Brunswick in 1949. He was a teacher of chemistry and physics at Ridgley High School, assistant principal at that high school, principal at Ridgley High School, assistant principal at Gillen Academy, principal Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You had two more seconds. You can take two seconds. He was assistant superintendent of Glen County school system, interim school superintendent of Glen County school system. He coached girl in high school basketball. He coached boys high school basketball and football. He refereed high school basketball football. He refereed collegiate basketball and football. He was a board member of southeast Georgia health system. He was a board member chair of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. He received the Distinguished Service Award from the Georgia Hospital Association. He was a board member and chair of the Coastal Georgia area district development authority. And I could go on and on what this man did. What this man had done. I think you have. I recognize his chairman night for a morning order. How do you follow that? Members at the beginning of every two year term, I know our returning members know this, but the Georgia legislative sportsman's caucus. We are caucus. We've got the house and there's one on the Senate, but we want to re-up everyone. Reminds you that this caucus has no dues. But this caucus seeks to preserve and promote the rights of citizens to hunt fish and pursue outdoor activities and make sure that we recognize the commitment of sportsmen to our conservation efforts. What you will see is a sign-up sheet like we've done all every time in the past sessions, but it will be outside on the tables and it will also be mailed to your offices. So we would encourage you to come members. All it is to sign up your name. Return it again. No dues. We want to continue our tradition of supporting our sports. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Mitchell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for an opportunity to present a warning order. I wanted to talk to you about vaccine efficacy and how it relates to public health measures. We are not just specifically emphasized that vaccine efficacy is not one number, but a series of different connected numbers. It can look at vaccine efficacy of whether it prevents actual infection. Vaccine efficacy can look at whether the vaccine prevents transmission. And vaccine efficacy can look at whether the vaccine actually prevents disease. Our public health measures are based on vaccine efficacy for disease prevention as well as transmission and infection. That's why you don't necessarily see measures. Public health measures move in sync with findings from clinical trials. So we need more information to know whether or not we will see those public health measures change as our vaccines get applied in the population. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Chair recognizes representatives Carpenter Ridley and Chairman Tarvan for a morning order. Ladies and gentlemen of this house, we stand here today to grieve the loss of a legend in Whitfield County. Shelby Peoples was an old school businessman and a fierce competitor that employed thousands of people in Whitfield County. His love for business, however, was overshadowed by his love for his family, his love for Georgia politics, and his love for Dalton State College and Hamilton Health Care Systems. I would call him the godfather of Northwest Georgia politics. Rarely did statewide candidates enter Whitfield County without seeking the blessing of Shelby and his family. Quick to listen, slow to speak, Shelby understood the importance of staying engaged at all levels of government. We ask for a moment of silence to honor Shelby's life and to pray for his grieving family. Thank you, Speaker. Chair recognizes representatives Gofield for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, I'm here to present the adoptive child of the day. Kelly was born in 2007. She's a smart and articulate girl who enjoys drawing, creative art, and writing scripts for acting. She also enjoys swimming, baking, listening to pop music, loves playing the game of life, softball, and beanbag toss. She loves watching Anastasia Heartland and volleyball games. I bring to you, Kelly, today she needs a home and she'll be a blessing to anyone who finds who adopts her. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Setsler for a morning order. Ladies and gentlemen, this house, I'm going to read a letter from a mother and aqua earth. To your left, you see her 95-year-old mother before and after this shutdown. Miss Karina Yakimovitz, the last time I touched my 95-year-old mother was 50 weeks ago, 350 days ago. My mother, Mr. Campoli, lives in a long-term care facility in the Evans, Georgia, and suffers from dementia and congestive heart failure. My mother has been isolated and separated from her family since February 2020. Her words go on. This long and cruel period of separation has caused mental issues, physical concerns, as well as emotional challenges for my mom. Due to weight loss and depression issues during the pandemic, my mother was placed on medication for depression. Her mobility has decreased, her cognitive abilities have declined, her socialization skills suffer, and her overall health and well-being has been stripped from her. My mother celebrated her 95th birthday alone without fanfare, not to mention that she spent Christmas and Thanksgiving alone. Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, she had family friends and church members that visited her every single day, but no one has visited her in 12 months. The picture to your left is February 2020, when she had daily visit by friends. She never contracted control to coronavirus, but February 2021 is Mr. Campoli today. Separation from friends and family members is inhumane, and patients have a right to be visited by loved ones who are central part of their care. HB290 is the bill that addresses this and Michiacomovic's urgent support. Thank you. That completes our morning orders. What purpose does the chairman of the Appropriations Committee rise? To recognize the chair for a motion? Speaker, I move that this house agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill Lady Bimber, and Ross, on the 7th, Jones, 47th, Burns, 159th, and others, be tauted and act to amend the act, providing appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2020, and ending June 30th, 2021, known as the General Appropriations Act. The chair recognizes Chairman England to explain the Senate substitute to House Bill 80 as amended by this House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm sorry. I left out that little bit about House Bill 80. I was jumping ahead just a little bit. I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, we're doing something today that we've done a few times in my tenure here in the House and four or five times during my tenure as chairman of the Appropriations Committee as it relates to the amended budget. So as we've talked about in the past, the amended budget is kind of the truing up of the course for the remainder of the fiscal year. And by that being the case with about four months left in the fiscal year, we have a lot better estimate and idea of what expenses will be, what revenues will be, and what the need will be of this state. And typically the amended budget is just that it's that true up. And that's what what you saw as two weeks ago today, I believe it was, we passed the House version of House Bill 80, the amended FY21 budget. So as we looked at it and realized once the Senate had agreed to a ton, the majority of our of our positions and actually had had added funds in several places to some of our positions, we realized that there was not a whole lot of work necessary to get us to the point of being able to wrap this budget up today, send it back to them. And then ultimately today, send it to the governor as well. We all understand the the tip of nature of being here and understand that if we wind up with an outbreak of COVID and that's kind of been the idea behind the amended budget and the speed of it that we may have to hit the polls button at some point. And also understanding that we may have some interesting weather next week as well as the weather men are finally starting to come to an agreement on things. And so we just felt like that this was a prudent course to take. And again, working with our friends and colleagues and the Senate, our colleagues at OPB in the governor's office through the fall into the time that they were preparing the original version of the budget. And up until today and our state agency heads and getting information to us in a timely manner has made this very easy and very possible. So I want to again always as we do do a shout out to our house budget research office Martha Wigden and her team. Incredible individuals. Those of you that are freshmen, if you haven't met some of that team, you need to their special people and do incredible work. Melody Debussy and the Senate budget evaluation office and her team. They've been partners on this as we've been working through our version through their version and where we are today. And again, director Kelly Far and his team at OPB and the governor's staff as well. And special thank you to my colleague in the Senate, Chairman Tillery. You know, I still still miss my friend, my brother, Jack Hill. But Blake is stepped into those shoes and I'm proud to say doing an incredible job and outstanding young man. One of those individuals that we can be proud of that he is from Georgia and is a Georgian. So I'm going to walk you through kind of the highlights. If if we took out any adjustments for for later information in the amendment, if you just looked at the true changes that are differences between the house version and the Senate version and where we are today, we would likely be about two pages. And those for the most part are very minor tweaks from the original house position are from the position that we may have started and the house finished our few positions that they started and that we've agreed with. So I want to walk through those with you instead of walking through the entire document. The vast majority of what you see in front of you, the thickness for that pack being as thick as it is relates to the announcement yesterday that I'll talk about in just a few minutes as it relates to our state employees. So the mid year adjustment for the increase in quick K-12 enrollment and these are things that that the house and the Senate agreed with from the get go. And the somewhat of a whole harmless for enrollment changes and includes about 147 million there. When you look at the 60% reduction in K-12 of the 10% reduction we took when we were here in June, school systems will be getting back about 567 million as well as some commensurate adjustments and restorations totaling about 8.5 million to other K-12 instructional programs that are located within the budget. So if you do the math, we were fully funded. We had to take the 10% reduction. We made a 60% restoration. So to narrow it down right now, we're to 4% reduction on QBE across the board of the total number. I know we've talked about 1460, but that is part of the restoration. But when you look at full funding, the full funding number right now we're only 4% away from what that full funding number is. 73.6 million in post-secondary education formulas. The house added about 8 million to the activities of the B units within the university system. We agreed with the governor's recommendation as well on the mid year appropriation of non-dean hospitals as it relates to the disproportionate share needs there of 35.7 million. Which when maxed with the federal dollars turns into 108 million dollars going into the indigate care trust fund. Again, agreed with the governor on the 25 million dollar adjustment for the forest land protection grants. 3.5 million adjustment for actuals on the outdoor stewardship program. Utilizing existing funds within corrections and Department of Duval justice to do a 10% increase to those correctional officers. To lower hopefully the rate of turnover there, which is north of 90%. And then a 20 million inaugural funding of the Georgia broadband grant initiative within one Georgia. We've all agreed to that as well. The house changes at the Senate agreed to was 15.4 million for the AIDS drug assistance program. 8 out 1.8 million for specialized behavioral health centers to stand up on additional 10 beds there. And funding to ensure that our elderly Georgians some of the most vulnerable among us in nursing homes have proper staffing and pandemic care as well as oversight of that care. Turns into about 19.3 million in state funds are about 60 million when maxed with federal funds going into that. And then another 4.9 in healthcare regulation. New Senate positions that we agreed to. 3 million more into economic development tourism. And that primarily goes to the Georgia World Congress Center who have basically been shut down since this time last year to help make sure that they're ready to go when everything opens up. 500,000 to support the schools consortiums dealing with the pilot on the formative assessments. GMAP and NABI assessments and those are primarily in south and middle Georgia. 197,000 dollars for rural broadband coding program pilot out of the Georgia Cyber and Innovation and Training Center down Augusta. 400, excuse me, 540,000 in temporary increase to our public libraries for their materials grants. We know that that's on a per capita basis in the base right now is at 35 cents per capita doing a temporary bump in the amended budget to 40 cents per capita on that. 150,000 dollars to provide short term assistance to ramp up the turnaround time on license application for renewals for nurses to be in compliance with the governor's executive order through the Secretary of State's office. Now in the amendment, you'll see some additions to things that we started off in the house and a couple new items as well as we got closer to the time. 11 million dollars in repurposed bonds that were purposed initially for the department.

the public health moving those over into the new systems for the vaccine tracking program and for the reservation program. So the total there now is about $27 million for them to be able to stand up those programs in a very short one to a time. $4 million increase to the governor's emergency fund. We realize that those funds are there for numerous reasons, but we also realize that with the pandemic still at our door that we're also approaching the spring storm season. And we know that we typically, hopefully, prayerfully, we don't this year, but we know that we typically here in Georgia have two or three weather events that require emergency action by the state of Georgia and the governor. And so we're just making sure there's enough there for that response if needed. You'll see $455,000 for the domestic violence and sexual assault centers. We've been talking with them over the last couple of weeks and their in the realization of some decreased federal funding as it relates to their Voka funding. We will be talking with them more as we go into the big budget, but this should help them get through at least to the end of the year before and the end of the fiscal year before we have to do something else in the big budget. Funded two more public health critical administrative positions. If you remember in the house, we had added a few positions there. The Senate came back with a couple more and Chairman Tillery and I and Dr. Tumion had numerous conversations and realizing there were a couple of other needs there. So you'll see a total add there of $485,000, almost $486,000. Repurposed about $2.5 million in personal services funds within the Department of Public Safety. As the budget left the house, we had a $4 million reduction there in field services and continuing to work back and forth with the Department of Public Safety and our colleagues in the Senate. We have less than that reduction to a million and a half dollar reduction there. Then $577,000 just a little over that in airport aid for the $955 partnership. So it's 5% state, 5% local, and 90% federal on a couple of projects that do have economic development impact related to them. We also increase funding for the legislature's new directives as it establishes or the statute that establishes oversight of vacant products last year as the Department of Revenue gets ready to stand that up. And then as the Medical Cannabis Commission begins into licensing and production, making sure they have the resources they need to do what they need to do there. Then as the budget left here two weeks ago, our version, we had promoted buying our local school systems trying to catch up on the gap before we're behind on replacing school buses statewide. We had proposed 500 new buses as we continue to work through the document and continue to work with the Senate colleagues. We had added some additional buses there. We have now settled at 520 to 525 new buses at a total cost of about $40 million. You'll see a notation within QBE and within education and decal in a few other places as it relates to the recognition of the $1,000 far teachers and school staff, local school staff, that the governor announced in his state of the state address. So we're just recognizing that in the document. Again, some of these things we do for historical perspective, because 100 years from now, I doubt any of us are here except for maybe Chairman Hogan. I'm just saying if you all are listening, say if he was awake. But in all seriousness, when we do these things, these do become a historical document for some period in time in the future that individuals will look back on. And we want to make sure that everyone understands the things that this House and the Senate did, the legislative body and the governor did, as it relates to this pandemic and how we handle things and how we took care of our folks that are state employees. And that brings me to the next item. The governor, speaker, lieutenant governor yesterday announced $1,000 supplement to all of our state employees. There are a handful of exceptions. There are some authorities that operate on their own generated funds. They will have that ability to do it. The Board of Regents has that ability as well. As you all understand, the constitutional separation as it relates to there. We send a check. They figure out how to spend it. They're very good about working with us on how they spend it. But I know the chance for Riggly and the governor and several of us have been in conversations that they're looking at something as well. But we're proud to be able to recognize here, you know, thank yous, and I've tried to make a point of every time that I've been up here, starting last June, to recognize those frontline state employees that are out there. Their jobs are not glamorous. They're not headline making, but they're there. They're there every day from the nurse that Chairman Watson and mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that worked, the public health nurse that worked 52 days without a day off, because she was wanting to make sure people in their community got tested. The same with public health nurses and doctors today that are making sure that people are getting their vaccines that are still doing testing. To our frontline troopers that have been helping in so many different things and areas over this past summer and even today being here keeping us safe. To our DOT workers, we don't think about those folks sometimes, but you know the restrooms and the rest areas have to be cleaned. And during a pandemic, that's not a real, well, during normal times, that's not a real comfortable thing to think about doing, but during a pandemic it's especially something that I'm sure has been uncomfortable. These are just a few of the people that we feel like that simple words is not enough to express our thanks and gratitude to these employees. To the de-facts workers, case workers, they've still been going to do case visits and homes. So there's these people across all of our state agencies, where that's DBHCD, Department of Defense, Veteran Services, all of these individuals have managed to keep going. I think it gets lost a lot of times that they don't have the option to only be virtual. They have to have face-to-face contact. Our people in community supervision have to have face-to-face contact. Our folks in the prison systems have to have face-to-face contact. Our state troopers have face-to-face contact as they're out on the roads keeping all of us safe. So the speaker and all of us got together and said we need to do something about this. So that is our proposal before you today. It's to take care of over 57,000 state employees, making less than $80,000 a year. It's going to be a total cost of about $60 million. Now where did the dollars come from? As the federal health emergency is lengthened each time they do it in 90-day increments. When we started in January, it had not been done just yet. However, if we got here and got to work, we got notification that it had been extended to the end of March. The way that program is set up, that at the end of the public health emergency, the federal public health emergency, then the enhanced FMount program will continue for 90 days after that. So another core. So the savings that we were able to capture there on the enhanced FMount program are the dollars that we have put back in to say thank you to our state employees. Mr. Speaker, that is, like I said, the changes that we've made. If you took the $1,000 pay raise or supplement changes out of the document, we would truly be looking at a difference to sheet of about two pages between our version and the Senate version on the thing once we got done agreeing and disagreeing and coming to a conference committee position on things. So with that, I'm glad to answer a couple of questions if there are any. And otherwise ask for everyone's favourable consideration on final passage. You have one question. Chair recognizes representative Owl Williams to your left for a question. Oh my. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've done them on you. Yes, sir. First, thanks. I know to, especially certain segments for the $1,000. It will mean a lot to a lot of people. And the educators are happy too with the $1,000. You said, and staff, would you define who, what staff is included in this $1,000? On the state, on what we're doing outside of education. No, just on the teachers. On the teachers' housing, he said, and staff, I thought, I heard you see. You know, there are some support staff that are included in it. And what we're seeing is local systems are also taking some of the cares dollars that came directly to them, then to also do the same thing for those individuals that are not on the state salary schedule for teachers, and doing that locally with those additional federal dollars. We can only reach those that have a contract with the state and do that. So there are some that fall outside of that. And as I said, I have just in the last week heard of several systems that are starting to look at the folks that kind of fall outside of what is being done there. That was done through the Department of Education. Of course, it doesn't flow through the document, even though we're just recognizing that it happened for a historical perspective. But as far as us saying how it was done, we did not have input on that, because that was a DOE decision. One follow-up if I may. I certainly wish that we would urge the local boards as much as we can, that essential work was also on the custodians. Absolutely. And some of the others that do work. The lunchroom staff, custodians, paraprofessionals, everybody. All the wraparound personnel. Yes, sir. I totally agree. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you. And then, that's the representative Williams, the highlight document that should be on your desk here in a little bit. It will have it actually broken out in it as well. Yes. Do you further you up? Yes, sir. Chair, recognize as the whip of the minority caucus representative Wilkerson to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I apologize. I'm losing my voice, which may be a blessing to you, but I apologize to many of the chamber. But the Department of Labor, there was $100,000 added for that. Can you explain what that would be for and would that be, would that help us as we try to process claims or is that more for internal audit purposes? It would sort of, for lack of a better term, be a legislatively liaison type position. There's a bill that has started moving in the Senate that would actually put it in statute to kind of be the relations between there as we get into these issues. And as I had shared in June and staying down town during that week, right across the street from the Department of Labor, those individuals, I was seeing those folks walk in at 530 in the morning and seeing their lights finally turn off at 9 or 930 at night. So we know that they're going as hard as they can. But we just felt like that there might be a need that we have some kind of additional relationship there as it relates to internal, external, and to us. Ms. Speaker, if you do not appear to have any further questions. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I do thank you. I thank you for your patience. I thank you for your input. I thank you for your hard work. And ask that you all agree to this and we'll send it to our friends and send it here in just a few minutes. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment? Chair, here's none. And the House Amendment is adopted. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 80 as amended by this House. All those in favor will vote aye. And those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so. If so, the House or the clerk will lock the machines. On the gentleman's motion, the eyes are 165, the nays are four. And this House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 80 as amended by this House. What purpose does Chairman England rise to make a couple motions, Ms. Speaker? State your first one first. All righty. I move from immediate transmittal of House Bill 80, the Senate substitute to House Bill 80 as amended by the House to the Senate. Chairman England has moved for immediate transmittal of House Bill 80, the Senate substitute as amended by this House. That would be immediate transmittal to the Senate. Is there objection? Is there objection? The chair here is none and it is only its way over. The purpose is Chairman England rise. Make a motion, Mr. Speaker. State your motion. For Suent Article 3, Section 5, paragraph 13 of the Constitution, I move that the House now order that upon receipt by the clerk of a message or messages that the Senate has passed HB 80 without amendment and has ordered its transmittal to the Governor that the clerk shall immediately transmit House Bill 80 to the Governor. Chairman England has moved that pursuant to Article 3, Section 5, paragraph 8 of the Constitution of this State that the House would upon receipt by the clerk of a message or messages that the Senate had passed House Bill 80 without amendment and ordered its transmittal to the Governor, the clerk shall immediately transmit House Bill 80 to the Governor. That requires a two-thirds majority vote. All those in favor of the gentleman's motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 168th and the nasors zero in the gentleman's motion has been adopted by constitutional majority. Okay, we're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 246. House Bill 246, by the way, of Watson, the 172nd Corp. of the 174th and others. The entire act to amend Chapter 5, the title 40, the fiscal to Georgia, and annotated relating to driver's licenses so as to increase the fee for the issuance of replacement licenses and permits this bill ever refer to the Committee on Motor Vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I bring before you today, HB 246. This is a department bill and basically what we're doing here is currently, if you lose your license, you pay $5 to get it replaced. If you lose it, you pay $5. If you get a DUI and you lose your license, but you want a limited permit to continue to go to work, you pay $25. That's what's current law. So in this bill, we are raising the fee from $5 to $10 for a loss license replacement. And then if you get a DUI and you need a limited permit, you're going to now pay $32. You pay $32 because that is what you currently pay when you get a new license with no criminal record on your license. So we're just bringing those up together. The current cost of the state to replace the license that you lose is $9.61 and you're paying $5. That's if you do it online. If you go and do it in person, it actually costs the state $20.21. So there's a big difference there and we're just trying to get those fees up a little bit so where it's not costing the state so much. And that's what the bill does and I would appreciate your favorable support and I'll take any questions. Do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and appreciate your support. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 246 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? The purpose is representative Thomas Rise. Okay, I can't locate the representative. If all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 246. The eyes are 153. The knees are 17. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We will read the caption to House Bill 2008. House Bill 208 by Representative Chokus and 138 Chasverse 11th, or every another 28th and others. Mitov and Act 2 of men, Chapter 4. Mitov I, the official go to George Anatetti relating to holidays and observances, so it's provided that the second Wednesday of February of each year shall be designated to National Swearing End Day. Chair, I recognize the chairman Chokus to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 208 provides for the second Wednesday and February of each year to be designated National Swearing End Commitment Day in Georgia. This measure simply creates a day of recognition for our high school J-R-O-T-C students who choose to join the Armed Forces. It's modeled after the National Signing Day for our high school athletes that accept college athletic scholarships. It has no physical impact on the state and it is not a state holiday. It's simply to recognize our high school students that decide to join the Armed Forces. If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. If not, I'd appreciate a favorable consideration. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. I'd be happy to yield. Chair, recognize this representative, Loricke, and to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Hat Baker. Mr. General Maniel. I'm happy to yield to my friend. Is it not true that I mentioned to you what an important role in J-R-O-T-C played in my son's life and that he later was enlisted into the United States Air Force and just this week actually is transitioning out of the Air Force back into civilian life right here in Atlanta and I'll get to see him. How much I appreciate you bringing this bill. Thank you, thank you, Florida, Loricke. What I want the state to do with this bill is share the same pride that parents have when their children decide to commit and join the military. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate you. Further, favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? The chair here is none. Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 208, the eyes are 170. The nays are zero. This bill having received. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 129. House Bill 129, my任. Watson, 170 second, Kelly, the 16th and others to be entitled to amend Article 111 and Article 16 and Title 15 in the fiscal to Georgia and Tadya relaying the general provisions regarding sheriffs. So it's to modify certain provisions regarding the compensation received by certain sheriffs this bill haven't referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Got another bill for you all to know. This is HB 129. This was brought to me by the Georgia Sheriff's Association. And in 2019, we increased the minimum salaries for all of our constitutional officers. And for some reason, we do not know what happened, but we had 10 sheriffs that did not receive that pay increase. And there in Calcutta, Thomas, Colfee, Baldwin, Lawrence, Habersham, O'Coney, Murray and Polk counties. And so all this bill is doing is fixing the minimum salary for those sheriffs and those 10 counties. And in 2019, we did this and it passed this body 132 to 27. And that's all the bill does. It's in the population range of 39,000 to 49,000. And that's what the bill does. And I appreciate your support. I'd be glad to say any questions. If none, I yield the bill. You have a question if you care to yield. I will. Chair recognizes representative Davis in the gallery. Thank you, Mr. Chair. To your right. Do the gentlemen here please? Yes, ma'am.
