TRANSCRIPT
----------
We are at the top of the house chambers.
Top the house chambers, so we've got a lot of the work that's been redone.
It's a rare, close look at the intricate artistry and guilded touches at the highest point of the house chamber.
Then you have the fine detailed work in here.
They were restored all this and then added some more detail of adding gold into that.
We want it a little bit. Georgia gold everywhere. Georgia gold in here.
Up to and a half stories, we're standing atop a complex skeletal framework, comprised
of tons of connecting pieces of steel, mass of scaffolding, built on house floors so
old, they needed showing up first.
The weight of the scaffolding is quite heavy, so we had to have a lot of engineering to
be done to make sure we didn't collapse this scaffolding to the bottom floor, so we replaced
all the flooring that's in the building.
were still went back to the original timbers that were from the 1800s.
Refreshing every inch of the chambers required engineering precision,
balancing preservation with safety. In that enormous wooden box.
This is our chandelier. The chandelier will see downstairs as boxed up, protecting it.
It's been cleaned. They're going to be putting new lighting in there.
Artisan's meticulously restored everything to its original
neoclassical look of the late 1800s.
There have been over 60 painters that have just worked in this building.
We have artisan painters that are here doing the detail work.
They actually started on that detail work in their shop in New Haven, Connecticut, back
last January.
So they went through a selection process.
There's probably three historical painters in the United States that do that work.
Kind of a knob color.
And that's one of the store colors that has been in there for a while.
But it's been more pink before we started.
There's been a lot more pink.
There's more what we called like a Pepto Bismalpink that was then brought in and so that
was been more replaced with some of the Bob.
The restorations, not just cosmetic, it's comprehensive right down to the air inside
the building.
They repaired plaster damage from the humidity in the building.
Originally, the domed ceiling opened up to let out hot air inside the chamber.
In the building and from the people discussing things in the building.
I would imagine there was quite a bit of putting it different times here.
Now, the HVAC system, the last time it was replaced is in the late 50s.
So it was definitely needing to be done.
So we're proud to have that and have good quality air in here and try to maybe keep it
a little bit cooler or keep tempers down if they need to.
We leave the house.
We're in the Senate Chambers.
So we started the restoration project in the house in Senate Chambers back last May.
are this past May, and so we're wrapping up in here.
On this day, the scaffolding is gone,
and they're working on wiring and new carpet.
In here, there's new stain on the wood.
Every piece of wire has been pulled.
Every item has been either touched in some way.
We have new HVAC and air systems in the building.
Handling that, we have a new stain on the wood,
new paint on the wall, new gold in the gilded areas,
and the chandeliers have been cleaned.
They are putting new wiring in a building,
not built for that kind of electricity we use today.
When we ripped up the floors,
we were able to do new duck work throughout here.
So just in the Senate chambers,
there's over 36,000 feet of cabling
just in this small area that we have here
and in the house chambers there's over 76,000
feet of cabling in there.
Lawmakers will have better access to computers and phones
with USB ports and chargers at their desk,
and where are those desks on this day?
The desks are being restored down in the depot.
We turned the depot, the Georgia depot, into a workroom.
So we've been doing the restoration of the desks
that have been on-site.
We didn't let them leave state property,
so the workers have come in there to do that.
Chairs were a little bit more of a challenge.
The chairs have far outlived their usefulness,
So we actually have replica chairs that are coming in,
some of them are original chairs
from the turn of the century.
Not the most recent turn of the century,
the one before those long ago, 1990s.
Now to the carpet.
It's very similar to the design of before,
there's some modifications because I did not know this,
but all the carpets have copyright design on there.
We've got this design.
It's actually out of Dalton, Georgia.
So Charlotte Carpet is our provider for that
and very proud of what they were able to produce for us.
Georgia grown, of course.
Contractors, architects, and craftsmen,
many Georgia taxpayers themselves,
treating the capital as a shared legacy.
But just being part of this project,
this is more of a sense of pride
in giving back to the state.
They've all taken this as their ownership
and that they're all taxpayers here in the community
and they're proud of what they're doing
and you can just tell by the quality of work.
Modern systems carefully hidden now support a building first completed in 1889 that hadn't
been restored in 30 years.
And even then faced challenges under House Speaker Tom Murphy.
The story goes that they were going through a pretty extensive renovation and they had
to cut off a cut a few corners with them because Speaker Murphy got tired of all the time
it was taking and so he told them to get out of this chamber.
So he was that was one of the things that so Speaker Burns has been very helpful with
us to make quick decisions. New ADA access, open committee rooms, and redesigned
stadium seating for the public. This phase of restoration in the chambers began in May after
careful planning to finish everything by the end of October. What are you most proud of
about this renovation process? Being able to get it done in the time frame that we have.
Preserving history, restoring dignity, and preparing these revered historic chambers for generations
to come.
