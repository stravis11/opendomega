TRANSCRIPT
----------
I trust you all had a great weekend. I hope you did enjoy it some time. Before this final week we have a lot to accomplish this week. We look forward to working with you this week. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in this chamber. Mr. Clerk, were you in lock the machines? I have all members voted. All members voted. All members voted. All members voted. Doorkypers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Members, before we go into our chaplain of the day, I want to be aware of this. You know the good Lord has blessed us in so many ways in this state and this country to have natural friends or friends from nature. I'll say, and there are many of the iconic mascots in this state. I want to tell you some sad news. Freedom, the Georgia Southern Eagle, passed away this weekend. This house will have a resolution honoring freedom. I want to ask you all to certainly what an iconic symbol of America. But how blessed we've been in this state to have an eagle as a part of our family here in this state. Not just in Harriet, but representing the values that we're proud of in this country. I know many of you have had your photos made with freedom over the years and he was quite the actor. But I want to just say to you, I know freedom meant a lot to a lot of people. And it does mean a lot to a lot of people. Freedom, as we enjoy the great freedoms of this country. But I want to ask you to remember Steve Hines. Steve has been there with freedom over his years at Georgia Southern. Steve is the gentleman that many of you have attended, have had the pleasure and the honor and the great opportunity to handle some snakes. And Steve is the one that helped put all of that together. But really the crowning piece of the wildlife center and for Steve has been his relationship with freedom. And he has pretty devastated job because he found freedom Saturday morning. And so thoughts and prayers go out if you will. Steve Hines and his family. And for a moment of solace, if you will, remember a great gift that God has given to us. Thank you members. Very much appreciated. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 53rd House District representing Debra Silcox. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. It is with great delight that I bring to you this morning my pastor, Dr. Rich Conwisher. He is the eighth senior pastor of Peachtree Presbyterian Church here in Atlanta. He has been a pastor for over 25 years and has served congregations in Texas, California and the New York City Metro area. He studied at Trinity, undergrad in San Antonio, and completed his masters at Princeton and his doctorate at Fuller Theological Seminary. He has been honored to serve on the Board of Trustees for all three of those institutions. And he is currently a Board of Directors at the Historic Fox Theatre here in Atlanta. We are honored also to have with him this morning his wife Kelly, she is right here. And Kelly and Dr. Rich actually met in seminary. They fell in love debating theology and eating ice cream as a reward after an evening in the library. Kelly is the founder of Optup Consulting and is passionate about empowering momentum for organizations and noble causes. They have two daughters. One is at the University of Georgia and the other one is Dr. Rich's alma mater Trinity University. Rich loves to read, swim and run. If you really want a great story, ask him about his Holom one and golf. Dr. Rich Conwisher. I'll be half of a grateful state. We are so glad that you are helping to secure the safety of our children. We're also grateful for your faithful stewardship and finally getting to a budget. We are grateful for both of those things. Instead of me offering you words in four and a half minutes that you will likely forget before your second vote. Let me share with you some of the most enduring and durable words in history from maybe the greatest speech that was ever given. When Jesus walked up a mountainside next to the sea of Galilee, these are excerpts of the famous sermon on the Mount. Where Jesus said, blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled. Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God. And blessed are you. When people insult you, revile you and hate you because of me. For in the same way they hated the prophets who were before you. Because you are salt to the earth, but if the salt is lost at saltiness, how can it ever be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trampled under foot. You are the light of the world. No one ever lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket, but on a stand so that it gives light to all in the house. And so in the same way, let your light now shine before others so that they may see your good deeds and give glory to your father in heaven. For do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. Be careful not to practice your righteousness before others in order to be seen by them. If you do, you have no reward from your father in heaven. And so therefore I tell you do not worry about your life. What you will eat, what you will drink, about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food in the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air. They do not so or reap or gather in debarns and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valued than they? And by your worry can you add one single hour to the span of your life? And why do you worry about your clothing? Consider the flowers of the field how they grow. They do not labor, they do not spend and yet I tell you Solomon. And all of his glory was not clothed like one of these. And if God so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more cloth you owe you of little faith? If we do not worry saying what will we eat, what will we drink, what will we wear? For it's the pagans who run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them. And so seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things will be given to you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. And do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others. You will be judged and with a measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust and your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank that is in your own eye? You hypocrite first remove the plank that is from your own eye and then you will see clearly to help your brother with the speck that is in his eye. Asking it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you. And so when everything due to others as you would have them due to you for this sums up the law and the prophets. And so enter through the narrow gate for broad as the way. Why does the road that leads to destruction and many will enter through it? But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only if you find it. Therefore if you are a wise person you will build your house on the rock. And the rains fall and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house but it did not fall because it had its foundation upon the rock. But anyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rains fall and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash. And when Jesus had finished these words they were amazed at his teaching. For he taught them as one who had real authority not like their regular teachers of religion like the pastor who's standing here today. May these words inspire us for generations to come. So will you stand with me and let us pray. A gracious and loving Father we are so grateful for the opportunity that is before us. May we begin with the blessing. May we hear your call to be salt to preserve what is good in this world and to be light that shines in the darkness. Lord we're not here to abolish the past but to stand on the shoulders of giants of the promise. We do not do what we do in order to be noticed and to be seen and to be recognized by others. And so help us to set aside our fears, our worries, our doubts, our insecurities. Strip away all of our judgment and our hypocrisy and may we now seek first the kingdom of God where we do to others as they do to us. And so may you impress upon these your servant leaders to walk the narrow path, to do the hard thing, to not follow the ways of this culture in this world but to do what is difficult for what is right. May we build the foundation of the state of Georgia upon the rock of wisdom, of eternal words as we care for the state that you've entrusted to us. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. The door keepers you may open the doors. Dr. Rich and Kelly thank you for being here. Thank you for those words. Come back up and join me if y'all will. And we're going to photo members.

Members, I would love to have your attention. A former member of this House is with us today, but I want to recognize her first as a former member, and then we're going to recognize her again in just a minute. But Rimsley-Villain Riley served this House with distinction, and I want you all all to stand and help me welcome Lynn Riley back to the place she called home, the People's House. Thank you members. We do have an invite resolution. We have a couple of them, and I'll ask for your attention over the next few minutes, because we honor some very special Georgians. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Resolution 85850? House Resolution 850 by Representative Smartner, 49th Burns, 159 Jones, 47th, Dempsey 13th, Smith, 70th, and others, a resolution, recognizing and commending Lynn Riley on the occasion of her retirement. Chairman Martin is recognized as speak to the resolution, and to this fine ladies career. Chairman Martin. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the House and Mr. Speaker. I'll attempt to speak to this resolution and tell you there's no way I can stand before you and speak to the totalitarian, the total amount that she has meant to the North Walton County. Commissioner Representative Commissioner, State Treasurer and President Riley has meant so much to our area in North Fortin County in the state of Georgia over the last 21 years. Yes, she served as a County Commissioner, a member of this body, the revenue commissioner, the first female revenue commissioner of the state of Georgia. The first female state treasurer of the state of Georgia and is currently retiring from Georgia as a president of the Student Finance Commission. She has done so much with her leadership talents, her remarkable patience and diplomacy, and keen vision. Her sensitivity to the needs of Georgia is beyond anything I've ever experienced. And that's just what she did for me while she was working with us on the higher ed committee. Y'all are supposed to laugh with me at that. She helped me. Now, in seriousness, down here you meet a lot of people that are good personally, you know, they're good with people. They're good, technically. Some work well in a team. Some are great leaders. Some know specific areas. Others are generalists. I have never met anyone and I stand before you today and truthfully say I've never met anyone that does all those things and more. I could spend the next little while telling you about president commissioner, commissioner treasurer and representative, Lynn Riley. But I think it would be best if the speaker would allow to hear from her on the occasion of her retirement from 21 years of public service for Fulton County. The great state of Georgia would y'all help me welcome our former colleague Lynn Riley. Thank you so much. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker for inviting me here today. Chairman Martin, my good friend, Chuck, Madam Pro Tem, my very good friends and all the members of the chamber. Thank you for the privilege to serve with many of you, to work with all of you and the great things that you have been able to advance in this amazing state of Georgia. I'm thrilled to have spent all the times we have together finding good things to do for the citizens of this state. And I'm very proud to have been able to work with each of you in that regard. I'm not saying goodbye. I'm just leaving the state in great hands and very proud of that and hoping that I can benefit now as a private citizen of all the amazing things you do. Thank you every day for your leadership, your sacrifices and everything you do to make Georgia the best state in the nation to live, work and thrive. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Lynn Riley, for your years of service to our state. But we know there's a gentleman here with us as well. I want to introduce him to the members this morning, this up in the gallery that would be filling those big shoes. Chris Green, thank you for standing up and taking over. You've done an awesome job working with Lynn and we appreciate you and look forward to work with you. In the future. Thanks for being here with us. Members, you may join Lynn down in the south any room for some photos and thank her for her service. And Chris, you probably might want to step down here too. In addition. Members, I want to ask you to pay special attention as you always do. To our next invite resolution is very, very special. Thank you MadamKY. Thank you Madam Doolkey. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Resolution 849 849 House resolution 849 by Representative Hitchens 161st a resolution recognizing and commending trooper first class mapes. Thank you members. We have a special resolution honoring this young trooper this morning. So members will please give your attention to Chairman Bill Hitchens. Chairman Hitchens. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. colleagues and I come today to honor somebody who's been honored in many many other areas of our country already but this is the first time he's been honored in our state. On last November TFC mapes and trooper cadets south were on patrol in Kanye, Georgia when they had a car come through the radar at a hundred three miles an hour. They gave pursuit didn't go very far and the car that they were chasing got in a got an erasing contest with another car and when the blue lights came on they went in separate directions. They followed the initial car went up the ramp and conures they tried to dodge the troopers pulled into gas station and the troopers pulled in the other side and blocked them both of them got out the car and ran on foot. Trooper mapes chased a passenger and trooper cadets south chased the driver. All of a sudden trooper mapes found that he was in the field of fire for several several bullets and he got struck and he couldn't fire back because people in the gas station were behind him and he couldn't he couldn't fire for fear of maybe hitting one of them. Subsequently he went to the side and trooper south heard the gunshots he'd gone in a different direction so he came back to help and after he went off to the side he had an open shot and mapes shot the perpetrator who continued on but together they ran him down and they arrested him. Both people were convicted felons they were intoxicated and they both had weapons. Subsequent to that Trooper mapes was nominated for the trooper the year for the Southern District International Association of Chiefs of Police which he won and then he was entered into contest for the National Trooper year along with a trooper from Vermont and one from Missouri and one from Idaho and he was the National winner so trooper mapes is the national trooper the year for the United States. He's got quite a history.

All in gentleman's motion, that the House agreed to the Senate substitute, the House Bill 68, is the objection. Here and done, the House has disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 68. This House is ready to move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 141-141? Senate Bill 141 by Senator Hatchett, the 50th and others to be titled back to amend Title 48. The House agreed to the fiscal to Georgia and Title relating to revenue and taxation.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to present Senate Bill 141. This is an agency bill for the Department of Revenue and essentially will extend various appeal periods for taxpayers from 30 days to 45 days. They're claims for tax refunds, payments of taxes. So we're extending that appeal period from 30 to 45 days. This legislation aims to address inefficiencies and undue burdens within the Georgia tax system that impact both taxpayers and tax preparers. And then the second section was a friendly amendment that was added and it will give local government an option to extend the ad Valerium Tax Treatment of Historic Renovation of Commercial Property. I ask for your favorable vote and I will take any questions. There are no questions. I yield the well. Thank you. The lady has yielded the well.

The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 256. Senate Bill 256. Senate Bill 256 by Senator Cowsard of 46 to be titled act to amend Article 4, Chapter 3, Title 46 of the Fiscal to Georgia and Attainee relating electric membership corporations and for electric cooperatives. So it's required electric membership corporation to disclose certain acquisitions. This bill having for the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Martin to present the bill. The committee speaker, colleagues, if you recall last session we approved a bill to allow a gas affiliate to pledge up to 15% of their assets. I'm sorry, an EMC to pledge up to 15% of their assets to their gas affiliate. What Senate Bill 256 does is put some additional consumer protection, member protections on that by requiring the disclosure of the assets that were pledged and the amount of gas that's being underwritten for those assets. The particular EMC involved is COB EMC with its affiliate gas out there, neutral in the bill. The Georgia EMCs are in favor of the bill. I'll answer any questions, but this is a consumer and member protection policy. There are no questions. I'll yield the well. There are no questions. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the Committee has agreed to.

The bill having received the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption. Senate bill 140. Senate bill 140. Senate bill 140 by Senator Stolls-Salle, the 27th and others to be entitled. Act to amend Chapter 30 to the top of 43. The official go to Georgia annotated relating to optometrist those to provide for doctors of optometry to dispense and sell pharmaceutical agents from to patients under certain conditions. Is bill ever for the Committee on Health? That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes four-liter gamble to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Senate bill 140 seeks to amend Georgia law to enable optometrist to be able to dispense and sell medications to their patients. The bill enables optometrist to sell any medication that they are able to currently prescribe with the exception being for anything that is a controlled, dangerous substance. This would be limited to medications that are for treatment of the eye and the ocular adnexam. There are many goals of what we're trying to accomplish with this. Number one is that we'll make it more convenient for patients who are interested in purchasing medications and wish to do so from their optometrist office. They would still be able to purchase medication from a pharmacy if they chose to do so. Oftentimes optometrists carry certain medications that the pharmacies don't have access to in their offices. And again, this would just enable optometrists to sell those medications to patients. This is a good bill that was worked on between the optometrist association and the Georgia Pharmacy Association. And I would ask for your favourable consideration and we'll yield for any questions. Yeah, a couple of questions. Representative, Park Kenner, your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? You said that there were a number of things that were solving with this legislation. Can you speak a little bit more to those maybe an incident that's taken place? A problem we're solving here. Just some more information. Yes. So in many cases, the patient will be prescribed one of these medications that an optometrist would carry. And it might be that the pharmacy has closed and they don't have access to get the medication. So this would be more of a convenience if anything else to allow them to purchase those products from the optometrist in their office. Again, they still have the option to buy from a pharmacy, but they would just be able to do that in an optometrist's office as well. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask for this body's favourable consideration and yield the well. General, I've yielded the well. I've had a couple more questions, but the gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Hearing none, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shout out, this bill now passed. All in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk. Were you unlocked in the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the past, if Senate Bill 140, 140, the yeas are 166, the nays are zero, this bill haven't seen the requisite Constitution majority as therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 93, 93? Senate Bill 93, Senator Campbell, 38th and others to be titled, Act 2, men code section 22, 153.1 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated the Georgia Early Literacy Act.

Senate bill eight Senate bill eight by senator crater could thirty second another's to be titled an act to amend title 15 to the fiscal to Georgia and it's any relating to quote courts So as to provide for arrest warrant requirements when juvenile courts are acting as courts of inquiry this bill Have been referred to the committee on Judiciary juvenile that committee recommends that this bill do pass Cheerly, do you may be balanced? You're recognized to present the bill Representative Ballinger Thank you mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of sb8 sb8 clarifies existing statutory authority of the juvenile court to act as a court of inquiry in the issuance of arrest warrant Based upon probable cause by aligning the juvenile code with procedure For other such courts codified in title 17 A court of inquiry is best understood as a descriptive term for a court with factual investigatory powers And the powers to summon and examine witnesses and evidence for that purpose Section one adds a new subsection to the existing statutory framework contained in OCGA 15 11 Seven for the issuance of arrest warrant to cross reference and restate applicable provisions in chapter one of title 17 Section two adds a new subsection to OCGA 15 18 six point one to mirror provisions applicable to other courts of inquiry Which preserve the role of prosecuting authorities to represent the state in the appropriate class of court with jurisdiction over alleged offenses Section three eliminates conflict in existing statutes by adding juvenile judges to the enumerated judges authorized by title 17 To issue an arrest warrant based on probable cause Section four adds juvenile court judges to those enumerated who may conduct courts of inquiry Um, that is the bill you all received a letter from the council of juvenile court judges Um, they have no objection to the bill To SB 8 since we believe it reaffirms existing law We're basically restating existing law and moving it from one section to another I mean, we're the happy to yield any questions Lady has a couple of questions and then we have a speaker on the bill um I got a little bit early while I go with representative Oliver is going to speak to the bill Are represented Miller? Threatenize for a question Thank you, mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I do can you speak a little bit to what it was that necessitated this expansion of arrest powers my concern. I'll just share is that juvenile judges are are typically not elected judges They're a point of judges and so why would we be giving them the same authority that we give to superior court judges to make these decisions They already have to they already have that authority as the letter from the juvenile court judges stated It's not an expansion of their powers. You're just restating And clarifying the powers that already exist in statute and the reason that we're doing that is there was some problems whenever juvenile court judges would issue warrants They had some problems in actually getting the sheriff to execute them and things like that So this is why we had to have the bill uh to clarify those issues and to Make sure that everybody understood this explicit powers that were already there for our juvenile court judges But just restate them and clarify them for everyone else. Does the lady further yield? Sure Have you during the course of preparing this bill or championing this bill Spoken to superior court judges to see what their take is? I regularly speak with many spirit court judges and none of them have expressed any concerns about this as they are the ones that usually Generally speaking a point that juvenile court judges So they're very interested in making sure that the warrants and the the actions of the juvenile court judge Are very reflective upon the superior court judges and they have a lot of confidence in those judges So no they had no opposition. Thank you. I have received several calls from superior court judges who Are opposed to this expansion. Thank you Lady you for another question. Uh, yes, sir. Her representative rise to your left His record Way to your left is recognize for questions. Thank you mr. Speaker. Does it generally yield? Yes Is it not true this bill ensures that our legal statues operate cohesively They're by strengthen in the administration of justice in Georgia It does thank you lady. Thank the lady for the question If they are no further question if for the other of you this will be a last question then we had to have a speaker Sure Thank you mr. Speakers the general lady yield. I do. Name is it not true that by specifying the War requirements for juvenile courts Acting as a court of inquiry this bill actually enhances the procedural clarity and provides consistency within our judicial system That is true, and that's the purpose of the bill. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you This is about yield for any more questions You have one more question if you want to take it then we have a speaker. Okay, we're representing park canna. You do you have a question The representative cannon yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you mr. Speaker. Uh, do you yield? I do. Thank you madam chair So would this bill possibly permit Defacts and having more investigatory powers Like will they No way impacts the powers that defects has or does not have Okay, and further inquiry So Will will defect not be able to get arrest warrants then with us? If if the juvenile court judge Seize if somebody approaches the juvenile court judge Um, and or the juvenile court judge hears of a criminal act then the juvenile court judge will be able to issue the warrant Um, that is something that they can already do Many of them sit actually as superior court judges by special designation and a lot of instances in various counties across the state There are 159 of them so every 159 of them is a little bit different Um, but there is no expansion or anything like that of the powers currently Uh, being exercised by our juvenile court judges So Defacts has investigatory powers though Um, I have I believe I mean they get referred all the Child abuse cases and they're meant to investigate those So they do have investigative powers already But this bill doesn't touch It doesn't enhance or Not enhance it doesn't touch any of the powers of defax Okay, I'm I'm not sure that I'm asking the question as it is but from my understanding Um, I just like to place a concern on the impact that this has on the arrest powers and investigatory powers Yeah, it does not again this bill does not expand any of the powers Currently exercised to buy our juvenile court judges It doesn't enhance their powers. It doesn't give them more powers. It simply clarifies The powers that they do have currently in law and it also streamlines the processes For better working relationships with our other various courts Um, Mr Speakers there are no further questions. I'll be yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration of sp8 The lady has their further questions. She's yielded the well Representative Mary Margaret Oliver is recognized to speak and opposition to the bill I apologize for trying to recognize you earlier, so thank you for Here precious. Thank you, Mr Speaker whenever I see an expansion of arrest powers. I get a little nervous I used to be a magistrate court judge and here informed and investigated evidence about issuing of arrest warrants I don't believe that the chief justice of the supreme court can issue an arrest warrant The former's venture the Court of Appeals and the Sphery Court are really any other court that doesn't have a law enforcement investigative arm to help him or her Really evaluate the facts before it. We have a dispute among the juvenile court judges right now This doesn't clarify this determines that they do have arrest powers from the bench apparently to go across jurisdictional lines And to camp county I think I had 15 different entities that were doing criminal investigations There was a lot of jurisdictional issues. We had to figure out and if you're asking a juvenile court judge giving a juvenile court judge The power in this bill which I believe you are to go across Criminal jurisdictions Then you're creating confusion many years ago. We passed a bill That created a child abuse protocol requirement within your counties So that defects was obligated to work with law enforcement and other entities in the county to deal with these kind of cross jurisdictional Investigation and problem solving Approaches in the I've asked what is the status of our child abuse protocols Why aren't we using these to resolve local conflict issues The council juvenile court judge says this is not their bill I think it comes from defects in their inability under a confusion or under a determination of a law They don't agree with to make arrest warrant and give them more power in the expanding authority They wish to have to do criminal investigations Mr. Speaker this is a very dense area It can be To decipher who has the power to do what but I felt I wanted to raise the issue of conflicting jurisdictions conflicting Authority and that the power of arrest is a pretty big deal in my book. Thank you, mr. Speaker.
