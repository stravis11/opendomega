TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everybody, if you will come on in and have a seat and we'll call the meeting
order. We've got kind of slight crowd today. Must be something going on in our meetings, I guess.
That's right. We've got the faithful here. We're going to ask Chairman Stevens to open
us up with a word of prayer this morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let us pray. Most kind of
the grace of seven and father, give us the wisdom to do your will, give us the
sight, place your hand on us, leave us and God is all these things we ask. Amen.
Amen. Thank you. Folks, we've only got ten Senate bills forced to consider so
far. We should have some more coming tomorrow. We had a lot of committee report but
but they won't be eligible until the court reports them out.
So we have these 10 that we can be considered today
and we've got some senators here that want to ask for these bills.
So we're gonna go ahead and do that
and then we'll go from there.
So come on up and let's hear from you.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
Distinguished members of this committee,
I've got two bills on your page six.
Senate Bill 58 is Georgia transporting life-saving organs and personnel act.
This allows organ procurement vehicles to take life-saving organs for one place or another.
If they are time sensitive to run emergency, they have done it in the past.
This is to clarify the law.
Work with Colonel Billy Hitchens, our Commissioner of Public Safety helped write this bill.
This will undoubtedly save lives.
As you know, personal to me, as well as our very own representative Rick Townsend,
who donated a kidney to his daughter.
Any questions?
Okay, don't see any questions you have another one. I do sir sent bill 84 just creates a special license plate
And it says a shepherd center. It's actually a different one. It's actually organ donation saves lives
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you sir. It's a license plate says organ donation saves lives
Thank you so much you
Soon to come home
Thank you mr. Chair I
I have three bills on your sheet, two of them I've already presented, so I can do them
again if you like, or I can just talk about Senate Bill 6.
If you've already presented this one time, then that's enough.
Okay, Senate Bill 6 has to do with testing for drugs, and we've passed fentanyl test strips
a few years ago, but what we didn't know is that there are street drugs that have shown
up that are not opioids, and so the fentanyl test strips are not going to pick them up.
are now test strips for xylazine.
And so this bill just broadens
so that it will cover any testing equipment
that we need for xylazine and other drugs
that may show up.
Okay.
You have the question.
Yes, sir.
It's a big protein.
So is xylazine all that,
like that horse drug?
Yes, ma'am.
Xylazine is a horse tranquilizer.
So it has legitimate purposes or veterinarians
But it's out on the street, and it's killing people.
And I'm not quite clear what the bill does.
It basically treats testing equipment
like fentanyl test strips, allocene test strips,
to be allowed, I'm not treated as drug paraphernalia.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
Okay, I don't see any other questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Yes, sir, Senator Dason.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I have two bills on your list today, first one is Senate Bill
138.
And it has to do with Gwyneth County and the City of Mulberry.
The reason for the bill, Gwyneth County is refused to enter into a service delivery agreement
or an intergovernmental agreement with the city, next to the mayor's, you know, unable
get in touch with the chairwoman or any of the folks at the county kind of
start that process. So they're not adhering to the transition statute. This bill
would bring that into line and get the Mulberry off to a good start.
Okay, you have a question with parks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Dixon,
is it not true that I asked the city of the mayor of Mulberry in committee
whether or not he had any communication with the county over the past three
months and that I was told to my face no and when I reached out to the county they
provided me written documentation of communications including a draft
intergovernmental agreement for purposes of service delivery received just a few
weeks ago. Is that not true? You know what I would say is the mayor was true in
and what he spoke, the chairwoman or the county manager will not return his phone calls,
he's not spoken to her, or the manager, the way that the county's handled it is that the
attorneys to attorneys have to talk. There was no agreement issued. I've not seen that.
If the if when it has sent something over is because of this legislation before we start
or to move into legislation,
when it refused to recognize the city,
there's a stop sign that's actually been knocked over
on a county road, and when a county DOT
is refused to come fix it,
Pell's residence to call the city of Mulberry,
which is clearly still the county's responsibility.
And unfortunately, the county's forgotten
that the city of Mulberry residents
are a Gwyneth County residents.
Is it not true that regarding SB 138,
ACCG strongly opposes this legislation
given the really horrible precedent it would set in waving sovereign immunity and again
forcing from the state a county to enter into these sorts of agreements without allowing
the city and the county to otherwise negotiate terms and I would I would say representative
that it's egregious and and horrible that Gwyneth County is trying to circumvent the will
of the voters. They ratified the legislation last year, and Bennett County refuses to work
with the city and recognize the existence of the city, and I think that is what's unfortunate.
Again, Senator Dixon, I have written documentation. I'm sure the county attorney would be more
than happy to also send you prior communications, including a draft, intergovernmental agreement,
that again, it appears the city of Mulberry is unwilling to take up or even consider it.
thank you for time. Yeah I would say that you know city the elected officials were elected in
November they've been trying to make contact since then the county to my knowledge has not responded
in the county attorney only reached out after this legislation passed over out of the senate
into the house and that is true. Lee Riftration. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chairman Dixon isn't it true
that after the election of the council mayor for the city of Mulberry that the mayor of Mulberry
made multiple attempts to have contact with the county commission chairwoman and the county
administrator that those were not responded to that the only time or proposal or government
agreement was sent to Mulberry on the county's terms only communication which the whip was
referring to was sent after SB 138 had actually passed out of the State Senate and the night
before it was to be heard in the House of Representatives Committee in that truth.
That is true, Mr. Leader.
And isn't it also true that there are multiple bills pending this session which would allow for
selective waiver of sovereign immunity and that this would only apply to Gwinnett County because
of the egregious conduct of Gwinnett County during this very important transition through?
That is true, Mr. Leader, and as long as the county hears to the transition statute,
their sovereign immunity would not be in jeopardy.
Thank you.
Okay, having another question, let's pick Pro Temp.
Mr. Chairman, Representative Dickson, how many, as a non-Guinette citizen of Georgia,
how many Guinette County residents now reside in the City of Mulberry?
Roughly 41,000, I believe.
And is it not true that this bill will assure that the welfare and public safety of the
residents, these Gwinnett County residents, is protected in a way that the county is not
doing that?
That is true.
By not entering into these intergovernmental agreements and that it would set a very strong
and positive precedent to suggest to Georgia that it is the county's duty to make sure
that these residents public safety is protected in the way that the government will agree
on what allowed.
That's true.
Thank you.
Okay.
I don't see any other questions on that.
You have another one, Senator.
I do, Mr. Chairman.
It's Senate Bill 139, also has to do with the City of Mulberry.
It's an annexation bill.
It's mostly commercial properties, a few large tracks, and it's not uncommon for a city
to come in and ask for an annexation after a formation.
There was a few commercial nodes with a city, was on one side of it, and didn't, was not
on the other side, encompassing that entire commercial node would help or would effectively
create that commercial node, that character area, whether there's more development or redevelopment
or just, you know, sustainability that's already been developed out.
Yeah, you have a question.
We're part.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Dixon, is it not true that Senate Bill 139 violates the
viola's of the local delegation that require any annexation related
legislation to require a majority of those who represent Gwinnett County
because 950,000 or those who may live outside of the city of Mulberry,
But otherwise be impacted with respect to any sort of annexation that the city then, you know,
laterally takes from the county. Again, is it not true that the only way that Senate Bill
139 is able to move is as a general bill, because again, it violates otherwise the rules
of Gwinnett County local delegations bylaws that had bipartisan support.
Well, what I would say to that is there's no violation of any rules of running a local bill as a general bill.
I'm chairman of state government in the Senate and I think I've got four bills on the agenda today that were local bills that are run as general bills.
So it's quite common practice, I believe, here under the bill dome.
As far as I'm aware, not so much on the House side. Senator Dixon, is it not my last question?
Is it not true that, you know, for me, personally, you know, I want to make sure the city of Mulberry
succeeds along with Gwinnett County, and I fear that continuing to move forward with these
unprecedented actions that again could potentially undermine the will of nine hundred and fifty thousand
clinicians as opposed to 40,000 that this will only continue to harm a
relationship that the city and county need for the long-term success of the city.
Yeah, you know what I would say is the county has a $2.67 billion budget which I
might add is going up 30% in the past two years. You know nine million that the
city of Mulberry captures is you know dropping the bucket to that plus you
know I would say that the services that the city will provide now that the
county won't have to you know the net loss may be more like seven seven and a half
so I don't see the impact to the entire county you know it is just that area
and the city wouldn't exist if the board commissioners would actually listen to
their constituents when they're concerned about zones they felt a lack of
representation they want a more local control and that's what they got this is not true
sorry one one last question is it not true that Gwinnett County has this one of the few counties I have a
triple A bond rating no they have a triple A bond rating as far as them being one of the few I
couldn't speak to that okay leader registration has a question thank you mr. chairman sir isn't it
true that all impacted representatives by Senate Bill 139 and all
representatives who represent Mulberry currently all support that. That's five
different representatives all support Senate Bill 139.
Madam correct and isn't it true that Senate Bill 139 actually passed out of
intergovernmental coordination with bipartisan support?
That is true. Isn't it finally true that when Mulberry was originally well that Mulberry is
enjoyed by parts of support in the community and what is unprecedented is members who do not live
in Mulberry do not live in the proposed areas to be added to Mulberry are attempting to the work
the will of the voters to ensure that Mulberry thrives. That is true and Mr. Leader I'm sure you
heard the same was we were going through the process with incorporation heard from
up team residents that were across the street from the city boundaries or a parcel next door that
expressed great interest in being annexed in the city. Was there another question?
No way. Okay. No more questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Brass, what bring you over here to this side of the building?
Well, good morning, Mr. Chairman.
I wanted to, number one, just come visit, you know?
We glad to have you.
I just wanted to say hello.
See if you needed anything.
I think a few folks want to be.
I feel like I need 75 things from just one day, so.
But no, I wanted to see about getting SB 81 is on the last page.
your franchise dealer franchise update we hadn't done in about six years or at
least not a thorough one and this it was all or majority of of that bill was
pre-negotiated between the manufacturers and the dealerships and they get
along pretty good on this one and we worked out a few other details throughout
about the process and it's just ready to go.
As soon as you all are.
Good.
I don't see any questions, Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you.
OK, any members of the committee have a request?
OK, I don't see any.
What we're going to do is set a calendar for our next legislative
day, which would be tomorrow.
Senate bill 81 have a move second any opposition it's on Senate bill 138 any
opposition it's objection all those in favor say aye any opposed yes on Senate
bill 139 moved in second any opposition there is an objection all those in
favor say aye.
Any opposed?
It's on.
Thank you.
That'll set a calendar for us for tomorrow.
And that'll get us started.
And then we should have a good many more Senate bills coming out
after the clerk reports tomorrow.
So thank you all for adjourning.
