You
You
We're going to call this meeting to order, as others come in, and we will catch them up.
We're going to have our very own Valencia C, our senator, to open us up in a word of prayer.
Will you bow with me?
Father God, I come to you once again just asking for your edge of protection all around
all of us Lord, we ask that you just keep us in your arms and in your bosom and watch
over us Lord. Give us and our families all the peace and grace that you have in your power
in Jesus' name we pray amen. Amen thank you. This is going to be the last public safety committee
for this year and I want to take a moment to thank everybody that helps outside of just obviously
We are committee members, which we'll recognize later.
But we have right here Miss Allie Farmer, who actually does all of this work to pull it
all together.
So, thank you for your great work, Allie.
Even when we give her last minute substitutes, five minutes before the meeting starts and
she's got to print more folders out.
And then right behind her, we've got Mr. Sean Cunningham, who has been our aide this year,
who's done phenomenal work.
And I think maybe the first aide ever to actually pass a bill out of this committee and body.
So outstanding work.
Carla Dawson from Senate Research over there.
Thank you for all the work to put together all the summaries
we have and all the information we need
to make sure we're processing this properly.
And then we've certainly got Ms. Rachel Moore over there
with the press office who puts all this stuff available
and makes sure we turn the microphones on and off
and then puts everything out properly.
And then last but certainly at least Ms. Jenna Dullday
who we keep awfully busy time here
through legislative council.
She does great work both before and during
and sometimes after our meetings to make sure we're in the together.
So thank you to all the folks who make this process work.
We greatly appreciate your time.
We are going to hear two bills this morning to let you all know that we're going to start
with House Bill 348, which is going to be the school camera update bill.
And then for those who have an interest, House Bill 301, most of that was combined into House Bill 348.
That is now a different bill.
That is the bill that passed through the Senate Committee
and the Senate already, both this year and last year,
which is the Protecting Victims and Dismentaling
Georgia Street Gangs Act.
Because that has already passed,
we are not going to do testimony on that again.
So if you're there for that one,
I'll give you a little bit of your time back in your day.
All right, so we're gonna get in and start with 3.48.
Looking for Chairman Collins,
and I do not see him handy.
So I will start going through the bill, and when he gets here, we will catch him up.
So in front of our committee members, you should have a substitute to House Bill 338,
that's LC 39, 3922.
If you'd like to speak on this bill today, there's a sign up sheet right up there.
Those that have been here a while know my rules.
If you don't fill the entire sheet out, you don't get the talk.
All right, so let's go through this bill.
This is a compilation of bills that have been passed
in both the Senate, as well as the House,
as well as other people's input to try and come up
to a creative compromise.
I know some people are happy about part of it.
Some people are disappointed by part of it,
which usually tells me that it's a pretty good bill.
We're going to move through this.
First thing we're going to start out is on page two, section one.
What that does is identify as a make sure
that a school zone is actually the existing master state order
of accordance with the school area is.
It does not go a thousand feet before, after, or through.
It's actually just the school zone.
I think that's pretty straightforward.
Section two, which you'll begin on page three, make sure
that the signs are properly there, warning folks
that their speed detection devices in.
I think most of these are there today, but this is just
to make sure we clean up the code
and make sure they're properly posted so people know what the zone is and then it's under a speed detection device camera.
On Section 3, this is specific to the evidence contained by the law enforcement officers in that area,
that we will not be using other traffic enforcement devices outside of what these are.
You're going to see this in a couple of areas specifically,
if you've looked at the next page,
that no automated traffic enforcement safety
shall be employed by any county, municipal,
or campus law enforcement.
We apparently have some challenges now
that at least one city in Georgia
has put standalone speeding cameras in.
And not only is that not allowed in our state of Georgia,
but we want to make it abundantly clear
that we do not want to live in Europe or in any state.
And there is violations for that as well.
You will see in section four beginning on line 99 that that is prohibited and they can be penalized if they do such.
Section five, this is the time of the day that cameras can run.
There have been a lot of questions and concerns about this and working with all the stakeholders.
We have made that the decammers can be an operational 60 minutes before school starts in the morning and 30 minutes after and then in the afternoon it's backwards 30 minutes before a school ends and 60 minutes after.
So limits the time to when schools in session but allows for the concerns that people had mentioned about people getting the school early for activities or being at school afterwards for activities.
Next thing is the only governing body,
this was Senator Robertson's bill if you remember,
that's authorized to do this work and put him in,
is actually the local county municipality,
who are the ones who are responsible
for maintaining the roads,
who respond to accidents,
who if there was not any other devices would be the people
actually out there running radar and citing people.
They are ultimately control of the roads.
I know there are some questions about the schools,
but the schools do not maintain the roads.
Continuing on to the next page on page seven,
this just makes sure a cleans up some stuff
for first class away was written,
but also that it comes from the Department of Revenue.
Thank you to Austin Gibbons,
the Department of Revenue.
We've got a bunch of cleanups in here for them as well,
which we'll talk about in the end.
All right, we're gonna continue on.
This allows someone, if you look on page eight,
That they will be assigned a hearing date in order in 60 days after the issue of the ordinance
However, if you were not driving your car you also have the ability in this bill to sign an affidavit very similar to the language
We if you remember we put in years ago for the hands-free driving law
Moving on section or sorry to page 9 a civil monetary penalty
should not be taxed on any fine penalty for your search
charge based upon the penalty.
So we're not going to tax a civil penalty.
Moving on after that, if someone does not appear or pays
their fine late, there's no more than a $5 late fee
for an unpaid civil penalty.
That is on the bottom of page nine.
Continuing on, there's some clean up language in here.
about penalties, they're all just more consistency here.
If you flip to page 12, that's the next part.
Any funds that are gained by the school's own cameras
will first be remitted to the police offices
and newity benefit fund for that city or county.
Therefore, making sure that they are helping to pay for
and fund the pension system there,
and then everything else will be directed back
toward things for public safety initiatives for local law
enforcement. Moving on, this is pretty straightforward
language here. Some clean ups. Let me get you to the next
changes. We do get to the part of section 10. This is where we
get to the cleanup language for the Department of Revenue.
If you remember, there is a concern about the work that was put onto them of sending out
all the notices and then tying it to a vehicle, then that a vehicle could not be then traded
or sold, et cetera.
That cleans it up and takes that civil penalty away from the actual vehicle itself.
Again, thank you for everyone working for that.
That is in.
One second, Mike.
Let me get you the right line number here.
Yes, thank you.
Too many lines in front of me right now.
I think, yep, and that's the rest of its Department of Revenue Cleanup Language that
goes with that.
There's a lot of information in this bill.
I want to thank the folks that gave us feedback.
Oh, there's the author right there.
Chairman Collins, would you like to come to the podium
and talk about your bill?
At all, I know I just kind of took people through it.
Come on up, so all the folks at home can see you.
We certainly can get you on.
Nope.
And we did not make any changes last night
that we were on email.
We decided to keep it as this.
Thank you for here in the bill, you know, the genesis of this bill started out.
Excuse me, I ran up the steps, I'm a little bit out of breath.
Take your time, we're all right.
You're already a chance sir.
Young as I once was.
So the genesis of the bill was to clean up the title holes.
And as I got into the bill, I started working it and realizing that there was a lot of other issues.
I know you went over the changes that were made and you know if the committee
feels passionately about those I certainly would not stand in the way of those
being made and just ask for your favorable consideration. All right questions
for Chairman Collins. I've got what number are you there? Senator Dukin. Good
morning. Do you want me to really ask a long question so you got chance to
to catch your wind or if you'll vote to move this bill you may ask me anything I'm ready
to be done. Hey look at go to 180 on page eight please. Okay. Yes tell me how that plays
out tell me how that works.
But if you if you swear in a statement that you were not driving the vehicle, yes, that
part.
Yeah.
Then you.
So I'd just do a sworn affidavit that I wouldn't drive in the vehicle.
How many times can I do that?
I'm assuming you could probably do that until the, let's say you can't.
Okay.
the only thing I would mention there because this was the same thing that we did for the hands-free
law. If you say that but they've got you there and you swore in affidavit, you're going to be in a
lot more trouble than that ticket. Okay, that's where I'm going with it. What is, if I do a false
swearing on this. I think I'll submit a gel for that.
Hey, can. Okay.
I think you're hard, man. You're hard.
Well, that was not what you do that. That's one of those things.
You know, the wheel's not perfect. They're a lot of...
This wheel's a lot different. It deals with civil monetary penalties, not traffic citations, so to speak.
So, we're trying to make this as line up as much as we could with the citation part of
the traffic.
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's a very good bill and I do intend to vote for it.
I'm just looking at something that we're going to probably come back to in a year or
so and say, how are we going to tighten this up?
Well, I can tell you that the feedback that I've gotten from our constituents and the feedback
that I've gotten from those House members from around the state and even some of the
other senators I've spoken with.
That's not the issue with this legislation.
Issue with this legislation is the fact that you have those silimentary penalties are
not being paid and they're surprised titling is what I refer to it.
That's become a really real issue throughout the state.
And then the fact that those cameras are operating throughout the entire day and not just
in that window, that's the other issue that we see.
I'm glad you addressed those here.
All right.
Some oxygen too.
So, Phil.
Are there questions for the chairman?
Seeing none.
Nobody has signed up for this bill.
At the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman.
All right.
It is the appropriate time.
I move that we do pass LC-392-2 Sierra.
Second from Senator Payne.
Further discussion with the committee members?
We do.
Seeing none, all those in favor please raise your hand.
One, two, three, four, five.
It is unanimous.
Thank you.
I appreciate you.
Thank you all very much.
And we'll move you on to the rules.
Congratulations.
All right.
Next up, this one is going to be fairly simple.
This is House Bill 301.
It is not the one that originally came over.
Thank you, Representative Ridley.
He and I work together to incorporate much of his changes
onto 348.
This is now the bill that passed with bipartisan support out of the Senate,
which is dismantling Georgia Street Gangs and protecting victims.
This is the exact language we passed both last year and this year.
Because we've already gone through committee and I'm like that,
so we're not going to do testimony on this bill today because it's already gone through twice.
What you'll see is this is actually Senate bill 12 and 11.
The last part is for the GBI, if you remember, allowing them to work either concurrently or
independently for anything related to terrorism that would be involved in cyber-domestic
biological, chemical, and nuclear terrorism.
So again, you've all seen this bill multiple times.
It's not new language.
Any questions from the committee members?
It is the appropriate time.
Go ahead, Senator Payne.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make the motion do pass on LC393921S.
from Senator Goodman, further discussion from the committee members.
So you know, and all the favor, please raise your hand.
All opposed?
Unanimous, okay.
Great.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming today.
This final meeting of the 2023 legislative session
for the Public Safety Committee is hereby adjourned.
Have a great day.
