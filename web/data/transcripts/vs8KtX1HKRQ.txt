you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you my colleagues before we move on to the next part of our day, what do you about an incident occurred over this weekend? as we begin this morning, I must take a moment to address a repulsive incident that occurred over the weekend, Saturday night, under cover of darkness, committees in North Fulton County were visited by an old enemy. Hatred. Sunday morning, families in those communities found anti-Semitic flyers in their driveways. Of the driveways littered with this garbage, too belonged to a member of this house and a member of our capital press corps respectful, respectively. I know all of you join with me in taking such actions very seriously. Local police are investigating the sensitive and Governor Camp has offered this assistance of state law enforcement. We pause this morning to reiterate that hate has no place in Georgia. No, no place in Georgia. None. We are blessed to live in a country which, through its very motto, recognizes our collective strength. E. Pluribus Unum, out of many one. Thank you. We will begin our day as is our custom with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 132nd House District, Mr. Chairman Brian Prince. Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my honor to introduce my friend, David L. Luke, pastor of the Stone Springfield AME Church. The doorkeepers have placed his bio on your desk, but please help me welcome his soulmate and his first lady, Ms. Karen Luke. Would you please stand. Representative McLean, it has been said that those who require a long introduction probably don't deserve it. And those that deserve a long introduction probably don't need it. I present to all my friend, Pastor David L. Luke, he here ye him. Good morning. To God be the glory for the great things he's already done. Let me first thank God for this house, this wonderful speaker. Can we give him a hand clap of praise this morning? And to my good friend and representative, Representative Brian Prince, the Prince of Georgia. Amen. Can you give him a hand clap of praise? Beloved there is a word from the Lord. First of all, I want to say thank you for your work. Thank you for working until the work is done. The word today is found for us and some 84 beginning with verse number 11, listen to these words. For the Lord God is a son and a shield. The Lord will give grace and glory. No good thing will he withhold from them which that walk uprightly thus ends the reading of God's anointed word. The power God gives us promise. He made a promise. One of the most embezzled memories in my mind.

was the day my father made me a promise. Made me a promise that he was going to take us out to play. Growing up in the rural area of Alabama, there wasn't a whole lot of parks, but the days of riding on the back of a truck when it was still safe. To ride with my daddy over the hills and over the byways to that place. Well, as fate would have it, the rain came in. The skies grew dark. And I can see the promise slipping away. My dad was a contractor and he worked till night. I thought while the rain was surely going to make us miss our play date. But all how my heart filled with joy to hear that Ford pickup truck clear in the heel, rallying with twos in my daddy inside. Because my daddy taught me that it wasn't a good thing to break a promise. And I didn't know how theological theologically sound it was until I became older. Has anyone ever broke a promise with you? Have you ever broken your promise? The feeling of betrayal that happens. The trust that distrust that follows after that. The word promise is synonymous with the word found throughout the Bible from the beginning of the writ. Covenant. The Lord gives us, draws us into a covenant relationship. Across the pages of Holy writ, God enters into covenant relationships with His people and Genesis. He entered into a covenant with Abraham. He promised Abraham, if he's willing to go where he's leading him, that he would be blessed more than any person that ever lived. Isn't it amazing how God would send us into the darkness and then become a marvelous light? But more than a covenant with us, God desires an intimate relationship. That means not a casual hello in the morning. Not a strong prayer at lunch when you're getting ready to dig into lasagna. But rather an intimate relationship that says, you are mine and I am yours. God desires a public relationship with us. A public relationship that says that I walk in integrity because of who I'm in relationship with. I won't cower into the night, throwing things on your driveway if I have a covenant relationship with the Lord. I acknowledge that the sacrifice within the Trinity tells us that if we are in proper covenant with our neighbor, then the world would be a better place. God is literally saying, I'm offended when we don't take time to spend with Him in the early mornings. As a pastor for the last 18 years, I have arisen to pray with my church at 6.30 AM. Rang's lead us know even when the wife keeps me up late at night. Because of my covenant relationship with Him, God is a fronted when the only evening prayer He receives is that when you are toggling between sleep and frustration, crying out about the day that He's given you. But if we are careful to be in this covenant relationship with the Lord, it reminds those around us He made a promise. On the dark days He made a promise. On the days when your constituency or on your heels, He made a promise. And He made that promise and He wanted me to tell you, He'll shield the sun by day and He'll become the sun and stars at night. My name is Dipper Evan David Luke and I approve this message. Well, you please stand to pray for the pleasure of allegiance. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let us pray. Father God, we are grateful for this moment that you've extended to us in this assembly. Bless us individually as well as collectively. Keep us, O God, in the hollows of your hand, for you are our promise keeper and Jesus' name, our man. Amen. I'm glad to be just to do the fight on the United States of America. To the Republic from which He stands, my nation, come down and be visible, be in justice. Go down. We don't need to take a picture of you. Okay. Let's stop right there. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet Revital Luke, the Chaplain in the South, any room for photos in just a moment. Members, if I can have your attention, you can pause just for a minute. We have one more piece of business that we need to tend to before we move on before we move on. This house became more complete today with two new members. That is worn in. My colleagues, if you will, come out to two new colleagues, Representative Chaz Cannon. Welcome, Chaz and Representative Johnny Chastain. Welcome, Johnny. We look forward to working with both of you. Thank you for your efforts to be here and join this great group that you're a part of now. Thank you. Chair now recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits, Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information and Audits have read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And on another note, when I was younger riding around my little town, I'd say, I'd see something that needed to be fixed, and I'd say, why didn't somebody do something about that? And one day I realized I am somebody. You certainly are somebody. And I'm sure it's not a little town anymore. You're not a little guy anymore, but you're doing good. Chairman Tarvan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal? Chair, here's none. The reading of the journal is dispensed with. Is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?

So if you remember the Augusta delegation join Representative Frazier down front. Great Augusta. That's right. Excuse me. Great Augusta. Augusta is great to win it. There you go. There she comes. It's a good looking cap you have on there. Representative Frazier. Representative Frazier. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To my colleagues, I need you. I need total silence because this is greater Augusta day at the state capitol. I am so proud to say that we have many of our community leaders, our businesses, our chambers from Berk County, Richmond County, and Richmond County, Berk County and Columbia County here today. There are out actually in meetings so they are not in the gallery but I wanted to recognize them. We wanted to come down and let you know that the hats that you have on your desk are gifts for the masters that you will be attending on April the 6th and Augusta where you will come. All of you are where you had and contribute to the economy in Augusta Richmond County for a whole week. We were truly, truly, appreciated. Now Augusta is known not just for the masters. It is also known as a region for our cybersecurity and information technology center. It's our medical and educational hub. It's a center of manufacturing and energy technology. What you are most interested in is the masters. I do every year, there is one lucky person here that has two masters tickets somewhere in this chamber. Normally under your seat. I would give you the real ones. I want to do a special shout out to our majority leader, Chuck Constracion, he did the calendar this year so there is no excuse for nobody not to be able to come to the masters on April the 6th. Thank you. All right, thank you all very much. Enjoy your hats. Thank you representative representative. No need for y'all to look. We already found the tickets. Don't even look. We'll check all the seats. I don't want to be able to do it. Y'all all leave. What a great event and that does all those folks from around the greater Augusta area does make it a great occasion. Let's make sure we all join with them today. Chairman Chokus is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I get to recognize two organizations. The first one is Chad Huchakowni High School. All right, my students from Chattco stand up. Superintendant Brooks. Here we go. Thank you. Let me brag on these students for a minute or two. The superintendent Kristi Brooks has been at the helm of the Chad Huchakowni High School system for just a few years. And in the last three they've grown by 300 students. So now they're over a thousand. They have a strong partnership with Fort Benning and encourage the active duty military personnel to send their children there. They've, this past Friday received a grant from the Department of Defense to help with their AP courses of $52,000. And their JROTC program has won national recognition. So as I said, thank you for woping my Chad Kostudents here and superintendent Brooks. Go Panthers. Go Panthers. And Mr. Speaker, if you bear with me, I have another two gentlemen that I'd like to recognize at this time. Ronning Cobrath, who used to be a member of the House of Representatives back in the 90s, represented one district 132. I think if I'm not right. Ronning, you stand up and Max Darby, who is the president of 13th Colony Distillery in America, Georgia. 13th Colony Distillery is 14 years old and is won national and international awards for their products. They make bourbon, vodka, and gin. And you can find them at many local liquor distributors in Georgia. And I proudly sell their products at home. So please join me in recognizing Max Darby and Ronning Cobrath. Stand up, guys. No, there are no free samples. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And 13th Colony utilizes Georgia grown products in their products. So pretty awesome stuff. Thank you all for being here. And welcome back, Representative. Chair now recognizes Representative Mack Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise the day to recognize John Hancock Academy, who's with us here in the gallery. Would you stand if you're here? John Hancock. Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome them to the State Capitol. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a well. Representative John Hancock's down in Sparta. Is all right. Yeah. Welcome. Good to have you all. Representative Al Williams is recognized for a morning order. Are you ready? You stay ready, don't you? Representative. Representative DeLos is going to join me. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is my first trip to the Wells. And as you've been speaker, I think I'll stay awhile. Tell him that. Representative DeLos and I are proud to stand our group had to leave for some meetings. But leadership liberty is here. Arguably the finest leadership group in Georgia. But when you see them, they'll be wearing our Williams-Lapel fins. So just welcome them to the Capitol, please. And thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A great group from Liberty County. No doubt. We'll look for them. Representative and we'll look for those lapel pins. Chairman Hatcher, recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues. We've got a group of leaders here. Young leaders from Citizens Bank of Lawrence County. And they're citizens of Bank of Lawrence County. Geath Advisory Council. So help me welcome them. Y'all stand in the gallery. Good looking group there, Chairman Hatcher. Welcome. We do have a special resolution, but we're going to move on to afternoon orders as we wait for our guests to arrive who's over in the Senate. Very, very, very special resolution that we will be taking up with Representative Jackson here in a few minutes. Chair recognizes a Monty Barnes, representing our Monty Barnes for an evening order in the morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues and good morning to our visitors. Again, my name is Emani Barnes. I represent House District 86 and Tucker Clarkson and Stone Mountain. I am excited to be here today to observe one of our Black pioneers. By day, I am a biomedical research scientist. So when asked to speak on an influential Black person in our Black history, I wanted to highlight a non-traditional person that we usually don't hear about in the month of February. So I wanted to speak on the sciences here in Georgia while also highlighting one of our illustrious historical Black colleges and universities here in our state. I came across the renowned Dr. John K. Haynes. Dr. Haynes is a biologist and academic professor, best known for his groundbreaking research and detection methods for sickle cell anemia. He attended Morehouse College when he was just 17 years old and received his bachelor's in biology and eventually earning his PhD from Brown University. Dr. Haynes received his post-doctoral appointment with MIT and worked with Vernon Ingram, a pioneering scientist with a focus on sickle cell disease. This method, Dr. Haynes developed a process to examine these cells under the microscope to tell us whether or not a patient has sickle cells. Until this day, we still use his method to detect sickle cell. He taught and continued to do research and I'm going to give you an idea of how sickle cell affects just our state in Georgia. So sickle cell disease per the CDC affects over 7,000 individuals in our state. Almost every county in Georgia has someone who suffers from this disease. About one out of every 295 Black babies that are born have this disease. As part of his work, Dr. Haynes created a program for high school students to introduce them to science. An interesting fact about Dr. Haynes is that I invited him to be with us today. He is a living legend. He told me he could not make it because he still teaches at Morehouse after 24 years. He's still a professor and he's teaching a class right now. The only reason he couldn't join us today. Thank you everyone for listening. I hope you take apart in sickle cell day here on Wednesday. And thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. I'm sure all the members of this House knows, Representative Barnes, as you do, this House has always been very supportive of sickle cell research at Augusta University and that will continue. Thank you for your morning order. Representative Roger Bruce has recognized for a afternoon order in the morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've got a couple of other folks that are going to join me down here. I thought they were Representative Beesmore and Representative Frazier. Representative Beesmore. Some of you may have seen on the news over the past couple of days, we kind of made the clerk famous. Did you see him on there? Except in the bill from a group of students who are concerned about their safety. We often hear about the students doing things that they have no business doing. But in this case, we had students that actually helped to write a bill. They met with Legislative Council and they helped to write a bill to help with their safety. And what the bill does is this House bill 238. And what it does, it creates a fund where schools around the state are able to apply to this fund and get monitors on the school bus paid for. And that's what the kids want. They want adult supervision on the bus other than the school bus driver because they feel like that is a dangerous situation. And the school bus driver cannot drive the bus safely and deal with the other issues that are on the bus at the same time. This, if anybody is looking for a nonpartisan bill, everybody in here has children or grandchildren or niece or nephew. And they want to be safe on that bus. And when the kids come to the Capitol, they came here, they met with Legislative Council, they met with the clerk, and they are asking for this bill. So please go to the clerk's office. Sign onto the bill. This House bill 238. And protect your children and recognize the fact that they are concerned about their safety. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Representative Hugley has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm to be joined by Representative Willis, Inca Willis. But today is Lynx Day at the Capitol. And if you have link chapters in your city, we're asking that you go over to the Floor Building where they are, and they'll be back over here at the Capitol at 2 o'clock. If you live in Columbus, Macon, Bronswick, Augusta, Atlanta, DeCab, Fulton County, or Chatham County, you have visitors here today. They're wearing these lovely green and white scarves so that you can recognize them. It's also Black History Month, and Lynx is part of Black History. It's one of the premier African American women organizations, and it's all about friendship and service. And each year we volunteer more than a million hours to volunteer service in our community. So greet them as they come today. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. We certainly will. Now, members, I want your attention, a special attention now, as we hear our last afternoon order. And I will remind you that we do have a very special, very special privilege resolution that will occur right afterwards. I want to thank the guests here, so I want you to stay in the house and be seated for our special invite in just a few moments. Representative Esther Penich has recognized and friends has recognized for an afternoon order. You do have a lot of friends. Everyone in this house is your friend, so some of you can stay at your seats, but... Wow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, you heard this morning this weekend. It was my turn to be targeted. Unfortunately, it's not the first time to be afraid as a Jew in the United States. I'm named... Jews named for the dead. I'm named for my great aunt, Esther Fried of Blessed Memory, who was killed by the Nazis because she was Jewish and disabled. So when I hear a chance of Jews will not replace us to a national audience, I get worried. And then locally, when swastikas are placed on my daughter's freshman dorm room at UGA, because she pledged a Jewish sorority, I get worried. And then when I see sweatshirts with camp Auschwitz on it, worn at the Capitol on January 6th, I am worried. And then to be called a Nazi by a political science professor and a former head of a local GOP group, I get concerned. And then to hear Kanye is right, being flashed at the UGA UF game, where two of my children were in attendance. I get worried. And then, flyers on driveways and in mailboxes of hundreds of Jewish families into cab, fulton, cab, paulding in Muscogee counties, I get angry. Because it doesn't end with that. It continues for injured and murdered Jews in their synagogue in Poe, Jersey City, Monsey, and in Pittsburgh in the deadliest attack in Jews in the United States history. According to the FBI in 2019, American Jews who make up less than 2% of the American population were the victims of over 60.2% of anti-religious hate crimes. In January 12th, 2023 report shows that anti-Semitic attitudes in the United States are widespread and increasing. 85% of Americans believe at least one anti-Jewish trope as opposed to 61% in 2019. Furthermore, 20% of Americans believe six or more anti-Jewish trope substantially more than the 11% in 2019. This report also shows anti-Israel sentiment rooted in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories is held by a broad swath of the population. The flyers we received demonized Jews, Judaism, and Jewish culture. They are filled with the classic anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish power and control. They came from a group that is famous for their outright anti-Semitic lies, including Holocaust denial, their twisted conspiracy theories, including claiming that Israel was responsible for 9-11 and that Jews and Zionists run our government. Their stated goal is to destroy us, kill Jews, wipe us off the face of the earth. We can do something, especially here, and we must. Please listen to the communities for the solutions they need. Do not dismiss them. Do not tell them it won't matter or it's not necessary. Hear them. We need your help. We've had enough. We hope you have as well. We know you stand with the Jewish community. We know you stand with the Jewish people against hate in Georgia. I am heartened by all the love and support I have felt this morning. We all know it might be the Jews today, but the same people will come after you tomorrow. Thank you so very much. Thank you. Thank you, Representative, and thank you members. We'll stand at ease just for a minute or two. This is a very special resolution that we will represent. I think you will be most appreciative of the service of this gentleman. It certainly goes right along with the comments that are just remade from this well. This House will be at ease just for a moment or two. You You You You You You You House will come back to order. We recognize the former representative, Ronnie Cobra, that was in the gallery. So let's recognize our former member who served here at this house. Thank you. Thank you.

in. Members will please take your seats. We have a special guest on the floor. A special guest. A special guest. Ladies and gentlemen. We have Representative Mack Jackson who's going to introduce our special guest. Representative Jackson, we're going to let the clerk read the resolution and then we'll have comments from Representative Jackson. Pay attention to this resolution. Very interesting. Representative Mack Jackson. We have a special guest on the floor. We have a special guest. We have a special guest. The last promo you can send. People request those applauded questions that everyone can put together to take them into practice. The last promise of duties for theende you have the honor that they take you to as agefran And he was working at a sister salon when he got drafted into the Army. He still worked at his barbershop today, cutting and styling hairs for 80 years. And whereas Mr. Graziano and his future wife, you with Bobby Schainfeld, while he was in dreams, where she served as a staff sergeant in the Women's Army Corps, and the couple moved back to the United States and raised five children, Louis, Moria, Marsha, David, and Kim. And whereas for most of Mr. Graziano's life, Thompson has been his home. He truly loves his community, and they love him. And whereas Mr. Graziano wrote a book about his experience during the war, a patriot's memoirs of World War II through my eyes, heart, and soul. Now therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the member of this body, and Louis Graziano for heroic actions in World War II, and honor the pride and prestige that it has brought to this great state to call him a resident. Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor for me to recognize Mr. Louis Graziano. He lives in Thompson, Georgia, in District 128. But the thing I want you to know today, he is 100 years old today. Today is his birthday. We need to represent his shop, no dishing like that. I can't do it like he can. But ladies and gentlemen, also I want you to know, he still drives his pickup truck. So he's still doing what he loves to do best here at 100 years old. I think that's the greatest accomplishment that God would give him the grace to be here for 100 years old. He's witnessed so many things in his life, and the greatest thing about it, he lives in the District 128. So again, help me to welcome Mr. Louis Graziano. Thank you. You want to say it? You want to speak? We're going to assist him. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Tell him what you did, Joe. Appreciate you all having me here. It's been a great thing to be here. Tell him about Omaha Beach. About the what? Omaha Beach. What happened? Omaha Beach with you. Well, I was in Omaha Beach. I was a third wave. I was in Omaha Beach invasion. And I climbed a cliff there. Then after we got up the cliff, we marched all our way to St. Louis. And that took quite a few days. Then from St. Louis, marched into Reims, France. When I got the Reims, Colonel General Thrasher told me I had to go get some supplies for the troops. So I went, took two of my men with me and went to the supply place to get the stuff from the Frenchmen. And they wouldn't sell it to me. So I went back and got two more men and went back to the reform man. And I told them I wanted that stuff. And they said, no. I told them I poured the gun at him. And I told my men to load up the truck. So they loaded up and I gave him a paper to take to the army to get his money for the stuff that we took. We're back and towards the major what I've done. He says, oh, we're going to get in trouble with that. I said, no, we're not. Because he's afraid I'm going to come back and get him. And we didn't have no trouble. There we go. One more. One more. One. What do you want to say? What do you want to tell us? Whatever. I don't know what. Probably met them. So many things that they like trying to think which one is the best. So we'll have to read them. We'll have to buy the book and read the book. It's the end of the book, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know I went with my buddy and I went to the ball game and watched the ladies play ball. And one that was pitching the ball was softball game and was ladies. And I asked my buddy and his girlfriend was with him. And she says she's my best friend. So I went around later and made a date with her. And then I went to pick her up that night and they said she's already left with somebody. So the ladies told her she'd never get another date with me. But later on I went back and made another date that time she was there. And was there ever since for 63 years. Oh. Oh. I don't know just so much going on. Okay. Thank you so much. I was in the. I know one night the captain come in and he says you got to go with me. We got to go find general patents. The company got lost. I says so it was known real bad. I got in the Jeep and we went. We found them. We had to take them all the way to Bastone. And on the way to Bastone, no, I got frozen feet during that battle. After I got to Bastone, I would have to go back to the range. And they put me in the hospital there for a couple of weeks for my feet. Because the fluid was coming all out of them. And right now after now they're black all the way half up almost to my knee. But I get along all right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. A true American hero. Thank you. If that story does it get to you nothing will. Representative Panich I know that his service in World War II is inspirational to you as well. I was thinking of that when you brought your order. Representative Sharper is recognized. Thank you.
