TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everyone and thank you for the opportunity Mr. Speaker to be able to bring one of the pastors from my church, Impact United Methodist Church and our pastor today is a graduate from Emory Candler and he has his master's degree in Divinity. He is also an individual that found late in life that he needed to spread the word of God. He spent 25 years in corporate America and then just one day he woke up and he said he got hit with the spirit and said time to leave corporate America and go do the real work of the Lord. And his role over at the church, you know, it's a very interesting church and that it does not fall into the normal mode of feeling like you're just going and you're under pressure to go to church. You actually wake up in the morning and say I really want to go and then while you're there you say I really want to be here and then when it's over with you say I think I'll stay for another one. And it's just a very nice welcoming environment and he's part of the leadership that makes that happen. So without further ado please help me and welcome Orlando Evans as I'll pass the day. Thank you Speaker Bruce for the wonderful introduction. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to stand before you today. I invite you to journey with me to first Peter. If we look at chapter 5 verse 6 we would find the following. humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt you in due time. For the few moments that I have before you today I challenge you with this thought. Is it time? Is it time? Let us pray. Lord thank you for the opportunity to share this wonderful word with this group of leaders that are assembled here today as we meditate upon your word. Thank you for revealing truth in a way that will inspire and enrich us in Jesus name we pray. Amen. I'm usually challenged please be seated. I'm usually challenged every morning waking up my son urging him to get out of bed and ushering him off to school. But last Friday was very different because it was the day of the fourth great field trip and they were headed to Rock Eagle Park. While I woke him up one hour earlier than usual he didn't resist like he did the day before. Instead he looked at me with expectation and he asked the question is it time? His question seemed to ask is it time to move from my place of comfort and go to a place that I've never been? Is it time to rise from my place of rest and journey into the unknown? And is it time to change my normal routine and embrace a new adventure? As he anticipated the beginning of something special he asked is it time? And today's text the Apostle Peter was speaking to a group of leaders who had endured a season of difficulty and they were anticipating a brighter day. He encouraged them to move forward by sending to the community that they were called and assigned to serve. As they exercised oversight they were to do so without compulsion or desire for selfish gain and they were to do so with willingness and eagerness to benefit others. He also instructed them to serve one another and humble themselves under the leadership of God by exercising discipline, staying alert and remaining faithful. In doing so they would experience the grace of God that restores us, strengthens and supports us and establishes us for a season that is yet to come. By God's grace these leaders were exalted but only in due time. I believe that this continues to be true for many of us today. As we remain steadfast, as we humbly submit to the Lord during seasons of challenge we can prayerfully expect for God to lead us somewhere new. So let's continue to be faithful. Let's continue to listen to the voice of God when we ask the Lord the question, is it time? I invite you to join me standing in prayer. Gracious God. Thank you for blessing our great state with this amazing group of leaders. As they continue to navigate through the complexities of their honorable assignment, please help them to do so with discernment, clarity and godly wisdom. May their hearts and minds continue to be led by your spirit and let your will prevail. As our representatives humbly submit to you, may your favor cover them like a blanket, sheltering them from hurt, harm, danger and exalting them during the season that's been appointed by you. May your grace be the compass that continues to guide us. May your spirit continue to whisper to our hearts in your holy name we pray, amen. Please join me as we pledge allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

Anybody ever seen in the tapes, in a matter of fact, she was able to get over 150 delegates in 1972 when she ran for president. And so even though Obama was the first elected black president, she paved the way and she was unbossed and unbossed in unbossed. And she really lived up to it.

House Bill 1111 by Representative Welch, the 110th and others to be titled to amend part one of Article 4, Chapter 12, the Title 45, the fiscal of Georgia and it's headed relating to management of budgetary and fiscal affairs. This bill have been referred to the Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs oversight that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Andy Welch to present the bill. I can give you a speaker. Members, I ask for your favourable consideration of substitute HB 1111. This is the first section deals with the cleanup language and the second section deals with the annual reserves and the annual withholding by the governor, subjecting it to a 1% reduction in terms of the trigger and making sure that the reductions that go through the first quarter are made, that decision is made in the second quarter of the year. So that I ask for your favourable consideration of the bill. I'll take any questions that you may have. You do not appear to have any questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favour of the passage of House Bill 1111 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1111. The eyes are 144. The nays are 14. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1112. House Bill 1112 by Representative Perkel of the 150th and others to be entitled to men part one of Article 4, Chapter 12, Title 45, and Article 2, Chapter 17, and Title 50, the fiscal and Georgia Entity Relay Management of Budgetary and Fiscal Affairs. This bill having referred to the Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs oversight, that committee recommends the disbale to pass. They recognize as Representative Clay Perkel to present House Bill 1112. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I bring for your consideration the Committee substitute House Bill 1112. It's 1112. This bill has got four parts. I'm kind of won't throw them with you for just a second. It deals with budget accountability. The first, we'll create a five member state council of economic advisors. Three, including the chairman, will be chosen by the governor, one appointed by the Speaker, and one by the President of the Senate. Then we quarterly review the state treasury receipts and publish revenue range of anticipated state revenues. The governor will set the revenue estimate within the range. It does not take away the governor's exclusive authority to set our revenue estimate. It provides additional eyeballs on this important process. The second, it's lines sections two through seven is a transparency piece. It's transparency in the budget process. Each agency right now prepares a white paper that they provide to their individual boards and to OPB. It includes their mission and how much money they need appropriated to accomplish their purpose. Our quest in these sections is just include us as well. It includes budget requests and allotments, program changes, and any notice to reserve funds. We would just like to be informed. So it's really a transparency piece. The next part is section eight, which repeals the code section. Code section 45, 12, 95, and that is section eight in the beyond page six. This code section was added in 1991 in the first part of the Miller administration while we were having recession period. He created his first executive action in 1991. I was to point the Williams commission and I came with his code section that has never been used in almost 30 years it's been on the books. It allows agencies to reinvest half of the savings that they find. There's an unintended consequence that agency could produce savings by not executing activities. It has never been used and probably needs to be pulled from our code. The last part is in section 10, section 10 on pages six and seven. It deals with the redirection of unexpended bond funds. What we do in practice now, but it's not in code. If there's a redirection of funds, let's say a bond came in at $10 million and we expended $8.5 million for that purpose. What we do now is allow the $1.5 million to be used within the department for the purpose of the bond. We had, as you recall, Chairman England, when we introduced the amended budget just 10 days ago, there was an item in there that was an $11 million DJJ project in Guneck County and the request was to redirect it. If it's over $2 million, it should come back before this body and go back through the process to get more eyeballs on it. That's really the bill, Mr. Speaker. Do I have any questions? You do not have any questions. You do have a question. Do you yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons to your left for a question. Thank you, Speaker. Gentlemen, yield? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that I have a few concerns? Or maybe I just don't completely understand. But if I could ask the three members that would serve on the Governor's part of this commission, can you tell me what positions or who they would be? Sure. So the Governor would choose three. The Speaker would choose one. The President would choose one. One of the three the Governor chooses will be his economic advisor, the one that will cheer the Committee and he'll have two other moments to the file person committee. It wasn't true, I understand that in the mechanism you're talking about, it would make sense to have the Governor to have the weightier, you know, more weight, but I'm having trouble understanding why there would even be, I feel like that they, isn't it true? I feel like that the three that the Governor would have would most likely vote the same way. I would think so. Okay. But my last question, if you'll yield. Yes, sir. I have any concerns that this, and it could be, I mean, you could have a three, two vote, you have a three, two split vote. You have any concerns that this would actually force, because of the publicity. I mean, this would, this would, if this were to happen, there would be a good bit of coverage, news coverage and publicity of it. I mean, do you not have any concerns that this would actually, from a political standpoint, wouldn't, wouldn't cause one chamber, or both chambers, depending on the political habits that have been divided up, that they would want to go, that they would want to get to publicity. We want to make this higher, we want to make it lower, just for, just for those reasons, just for the political reasons. We want to, we want to get this thing down, we want to have, we want to have a lower revenue estimate. So we don't spend as much money. We want to have it higher, so we can, so we can pay for more things. Do you have any concerns about that? No, sir, I don't. And honestly, this is not a political question for me. This is actually a policy thing. So you will get, you will get economists that are, have the, have the solemn duty of looking at expected revenues, I look at the, the economy throughout the state. And I'm not, this is, this is a policy decision. The governor would have three appointments and it, it, it puts us at the table to, to listen to the dialogue and I'm not, okay, I appreciate this gentleman yield for one more on. Yes sir, I would, okay, problem. I'm, I'm a little, apprehensive about if there were, and sometimes the governor does make changes in his estimate, even when we're in session. This correct. What impact would this have on that with this, with, with this commission? And there are changes, even after we're in session, that based on the revenues coming in or what, what the forecast is, based on revenues that will come in, that he has to make a, a, a late change in it. There needs to be a late change. How would that even work? And thank you for that because they will meet quarterly. So there will be opportunities to, to, to make changes before they actually give us the revenue estimate that we build the budget on. So there will be opportunities. Thank you for that. You do not have any other questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute, the chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 1112 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1112, the eyes are 138. The nays are 28. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does Chairman Welch arise? Make a motion. State your motion. I have two. The first one is to move that House Bill 1112 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. On the gentleman's motion that House Bill 1112 be immediately transmitted to the Senate, is their objection. Is their objection. Chair here is none and it's on its way. The second motion, the speaker, is that state your motion for immediate transmission of House Bill 11111. 1111. On the gentleman's motion that House Bill 1111 be immediately transmitted to the Senate, is their objection? Is their objection. On the chair here is none and it is on its way to the Senate too. The clerk will read the caption. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 793. House Bill 793 by Representative Ralston and the 7th and others to be a talent act to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020.

In ending June 30th, 2021, this bill I have referred to the committee on appropriations. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair, resolves the House into a committee of the whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 793, the General Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2021. The chair appoints the gentleman from the 159th District, the majority leader of the House leader burns as chairman to preside over the committee of the whole House leader burns. The chair appoints the gentleman from the 159th District, the majority leader of the House leader burns as chairman of the House of the House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will move forward. The chair will recognize the gentleman from the 16th Representative England to present the bill. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, it's taken a bit to get here, but as always we come to a day that we sit down and do those things in which we're sitting here to do and today is one of those. First, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your input and the time that you've taken as we have come to this day to adopt our version of the FY21 budget. It's been a long journey to get here today, and we've only gotten here through God's grace and mercy. Thank you to our speaker and our leadership for listening to our needs back a few weeks ago for the pause because it set us in good shape to be here today. Thank you especially to our subcommittee chairs and the members of the committee for the long hours of work that they've put in. But most of all, this group of individuals standing out here on the front row are staff of the House Budget Research Office. They do an outstanding job, and it's not just a job that they do 40 days out of the year. It's a job that they do 365 days out of the year, 24, 7, 365 in many cases. Thank you as well to Governor Kent, his Chief of Staff, Tim Fleming, Director Far with OPB, their staff, and our agency heads that have been talking to us and helping us as we've gone through our information, gone through their agency submittals, and for all their hard work and cooperation as well. I'm proud to stand before you today to present the House version of the State's fiscal year 21 spending plan. 28.1 billion dollars are just a little over 2% growth over FY20. That 2% equates to about $566 million in new funding, an extremely conservative and cautious revenue estimate by the Governor that recognizes that the economy can be and is fickle many times. But, $566 million is still a respectable amount of growth. And while the Governor's original budget directed over 99% of that new money to teacher raises, and $1,000 raises to some employees, your subcommittees and full committee have taken a little bit different route. Think of it this way. The budget is a lot like an iceberg. It's easy to focus on the exposed bright peaks that are above the surface. But beneath the water lies about 9 tenths of that iceberg. And that's what we have to look at. And because the Governor's budget also contained over 300 million in proposed agency reductions below that water line, your subcommittees looked at the entire iceberg and felt very strongly. That we had to fortify our base before the tip of the iceberg got even higher. To that end, some of those new funds absolutely had to be reworked and ongoing needs to make certain we are all on solid ground. As we walked through the changes, I will note many activities where the reduction was softened or restored. But take note, we have still been effective in providing salary increases that include an additional $1,000 to certify to educate yours. A 2% merit raised to state employees and employees of the university system, as well as targeted raises of an additional 2 to 5% to address the jobs with the most egregious turnover rates, which also ensure that those targeted low salaries get at least $1,000 of that are originally proposed. And that is not only proposed $1,000 at least $1,000 or a little bit more of that are originally proposed $1,000. In tandem with the salaries, many of the reductions to agencies in the Governor's proposal are based on the elimination of 1212 vacant positions. And because we recognize that the workload doesn't necessarily go away because the cubicle next to you is empty. And the salaries are being asked to carry and manage more of the load. The consensus is that there should be some financial recognition of that at every staffing level. In regards to vacancies, the House reviewed and agreed with eliminating 80% of those proposed eliminations in the Governor's proposal. But your subcommittees have recommended maintaining 236 of those positions. That's actually not much out of the workforce of 113,000 when you include regions. 77 of those replaced in behavioral health, public health and human services. 54 in GBI and law and Department of Law and Public Defenders. And 52 across educational agencies. Sourings and the impact of budget cuts have dominated our conversations. Your subcommittees have worked intensely and so successfully to strike a balance between the two across the board that is obvious as we proceed through the changes. So if you would, please take out the tracking document. There are two documents on your desk as well as some budget talking points that were delivered this morning. But the tracking document is the one that's the easiest to go through as we track these changes. So in Section 1, Georgia Senate no changes at this time. Section 2, the Georgia House of Representatives. At 2.1.2, you'll see the first recognition of the statewide change of the 2% merit increase to all state employees. We will not touch on that as we go through each of the departments in light of time. However, we will go through and highlight those where we have done some additional merit and targeted increases. At 2.1.3, recognizing some operational efficiencies but also directing that those being used instead of funds being added for the special session next year to deal with rear portion. 3.1.500 that joint offices of the General Assembly. You'll see some added funds there for starting to staff up for rear portion. Section 4, audits and accounts. Those are the statewide changes and just some true ups there within that. Court of Appeals. Looking at 5.1.6 and 1.7, those are two joint positions that were asked far by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. We're saying no to those positions at this time. And under the statewide business court at 5.2.1, just to true up any actual dollars needed for the operation of that court. Moving on to 6.4.300 judicial counsel. You'll see a reduction in the add there for the kinship care. That actually puts them at $500,000 in the base of budget. And we can then true up if there's any additional needs there as we come back in the amended budget next January. You'll see the elimination of one position that was asked far at 6.4.4. And then down under the JQC at 6.5, you'll see some agencies, see requested positions there so that they can continue to carry out their functions across the state. Juvenile courts. 7.1.2, saying no to that position add right now because it's currently funded under DJJ using federal funds. So we will continue to use those federal funds until they go away and at that point then we will come back with state funds to fund that position. Moving on to prosecuting attorneys at 8.2.3. You'll see a reduction there in the recruitment and retention piece proposed by the judiciary. And just saying go with half of that but focus that on those that are further behind on the pay scale. 8.2.4 adding 6 assistant district attorneys in rural areas. And then at 8.2.6, 7 and 8 adding for the new judge ships that will be effective January 1st of next year. Superior court section 9. If you look at 9.3.6, 7 and 8 again the recognition of the additional judge ships. Then 9.3.9, just saying provide funds for five staff attorney positions at this time for those circuits with the biggest need. Under Supreme Court again at 10.1.9 and 10.1.10, those two shared positions that we said no to back in the court of appeals. Under the state accounting office, you'll see the state wide changes there on the first page. Then moving over under the government transparency and campaign finance commission. Some requested ads by the commission for one senior auditor, one junior auditor, one administrative financial assistant and one training IT person there so they can continue to do the job that they do. Under section 12, Department of Administrative Services, you'll see us saying no to the cut at certificate of need panel. That is actually required by code that that panel exists. Section 13 under the Department of Agriculture. At 13.1.4, there was a recommendation from zero based budgeting last year to move the Athens and Tiffton Betlabs over to the Board of Regents out from under the Department of Ag. However, it does require legislation to be introduced so that the Board of Regents can actually make the rate determinations for what will be charged for the testing. That has not been done at this point in time so it's necessary that that remain under the purview of the Department of Agriculture. 13.2.6, a restoration there of $339,000, almost $340,000 for two animal inspectors and two food safety inspectors. Moving down to 13.2.7, saying no to that reduction because those savings would not be realized. And then at 13.2.8, you'll see the first of several targeted increases within the budget, a 4% targeted salary increase on top of the 2% that we've already talked about. So it would be a 6% total for these food inspector positions. Those that are charged for making sure that the food that we eat every day around this state that we consume or buy from grocery stores and such is safe and adequate and wholesome for our families. 13.2.9, just the recognition of the Georgia Hemp program and its stand-up cost and operational cost there. 13.3.6, just some additional savings that could be garnered there. 13.4.5 under marketing and promotion. We restored the international trade rep and the business support analysts and then on down at 13.4.6 as it relates to Georgia Grown, restoring the Georgia Grown Marketing Program, the Georgia Grown website and some farmers market maintenance money. And then again, at 13.4.7, a 4% targeted additional raise there. Under 13.5.2, the poultry vet diagnostic labs, reduction of the cut there just to allow them to finish up some of the work that they've been doing and preparing for aiming to influenza and the equipment that was bought and the shed that was purchased last year to park that equipment under. Then moving on to salt and water conservation commission, some true ups there for vacancies and hiring dates changes and then at 13.7.9 you'll see the addition for one erosion settlement control plan reviewer. NRCS is reducing the number of those plans that they're reviewing statewide so more of that is falling to the state salt and water conservation commission to do. So we're making in finance, you'll see statewide changes but then at 14.3.6, you'll see what we're saying at this point not to move the industrial loan program that that also requires legislation for that move to be made so we're seeing no to that because we don't have the legislation at this point. We also corresponds at 29.4.4 and we'll touch on that in a few minutes. Moving on to behavioral health and developmental disability section 15, chair lady Dempsey and her committee have met hour after hour after hour and heard hours upon hours of testimony from the support community for the individuals that fall into this category fall into the category of receiving services from DBH DD. And I don't know how many of you watch those hearings but if what you hear and what you see in those hearings do not touch you then I just honestly wonder if you've got a heart. And so in doing so in realizing that many of these services are the things that allow parents and caretakers the ability to go out and actually work a job and do things be productive community members of the community. If their loved ones can be cared for for a portion of the day while they can go do those jobs and it gives them a chance to have respite as well because believe me knowing firsthand from caring for sick loved one you've got to have that respite time you got to have that little bit of time to run to the doctor run to the grocery store and that's a lot of what winds up being helped here and and DBH DD. So if you look at 15.1.4 you'll see where we're softening that proposed cut and increasing statewide bed capacity by 44 beds taking it from 176 beds to 220. Then at 15.1.5 utilize some existing funds there for pregnant postpartum women living with substance abuse issues. 15.2.9 reducing the cut there but allowing for the maintaining of the contract with the Bobby Dyn institute and Easter Seals and the things that they provide for our Georgia families. 15.2.11 restoring four of the 12 proposed reduced slides there for four individuals that were not in positions that were transferable. At 15.2.12 another one of those items that I know each and every one of you have heard from constituents about I know I've heard from multiple constituents about and that is increasing the number of now in comp waivers that are available to citizens across the state. So we're saying increase of 100 slides 60 cop and 40 now waivers currently there's 6,314 individuals on the wait list. So we're trying to just address that as best we can. 15.2.13 another one of the targeted salary increases for a high turnover rate they're dealing with approximate of 48% turnover rate within the agency there at DBH DD. You'll see another reduction at 15.3.5 again two positions out of 14 proposed to be cut that risk of not being able to transfer. 13.3.7 4% targeted increase there moving on to 15.4.7 slowing the reduction there under training for behavioral health workforce many of these positions are out in rural Georgia this allows some increased flexibility for DBH DD in that training and who they contract with for that training. Moving down to 15.4.10 saying no to the reduction in funds of 8.3 million dollars to behavioral health services making a full restoration that will mean 6800 additional individuals will be served. 15.4.11 increasing the statewide crisis bed capacity to maintain 95 beds and then at 15.4.2 another additional 4% targeted increase to slow or help to slow the increase. 15.6.4 saying no to the reduction in the contract with the Marcus Altissian centers or restoration of 7.5 or excuse me 750 thousand dollars there. 15.8.8 saying no to the crisis respite home full reduction but going back and replacing part of that rivers edge CSB that serves building Clayton County that will be in the center of the city. Clayton County that will allow them to have 16 beds at each location there. 15.9.5 restoring two of 18 proposed positions there. 15.10.6 restoring 14 of 59 proposed reduction positions there. 15.10.7 another one of the targeted 4% salary increases for the high turnover rates. 15.11.3 you'll see where we're saying redirect 130 thousand dollars and one time funds for curriculum development to be used in additional prevention services. Moving on down to the attached agency under the sexual offender review board at 15.13.4 you'll see where we have reduced that because one of those positions has to remain at GBI for them to have access to the database. So we're saying we'll put one at GBI and put one here but one has to remain at GBI that both cannot be at the sexual offender review board. Section 16 Department of Community Affairs at 16.1.2 we're saying no for the time being on that particular transfer legislation is required but however it has not been filed and you'll see the corresponding entry at 29.3.6 in just a few minutes. 16.2.5 chair lady housed in her committee a couple years ago had received audit information as it related to the Atlanta Regional Commission and some issues of funds there. We had made a reduction at that time on their annual operating grant. We're saying now that they have those issues corrected and are playing with good faith that we want to restore that cut that was made at that point in time. 16.3.4 saying no to that elimination for the Georgia advocacy office because it is not duplicated services. Moving on through to 16.10 at 16.10.2 saying no to doing away with the Athens Design Studio. Individual over there works with a lot of the college students but more importantly that particular department serves 30 to 35 communities across the state every year and they get a lot of actual hands on work out of students that are there at the University of Georgia. 16.10.4 just an adjustment there and true up. Georgia Commission on a Holocaust I'll stop right here for just a second. It was originally proposed on the governor's budget to move commission on a Holocaust to Kennesaw State University and listening to many of those advocates in the Jewish community realize that was not going to be necessarily a very good fit at all. And what we're recommending here is to transfer as an attached agency just as it's an attached agency under DCA. The move it is an attached agency over to the board of regents but not assigned up under any particular school so it still gives them the flexibility to operate as an independent entity and not be tied to one of the regents institutions. On down under GFIT 16.14 you'll see partial restoration at 16.14.2.3 and 4 and then you'll see an addition at 16.14.5 for the five year water plan that's required of the Metro water planning district. We'll be talking with our friends in the Senate to get that of what's fully needed there under one Georgia authority at 16.16.2. Just the recognition there that one Georgia authority will be the one that actually pays the state assessment for the Appalachian Regional Commission, a commission at services and works with 37 North Georgia and Northwest Georgia communities across the state. Moving on to the Department of Community Health Section 17. If you'll look at 17.4.3 you'll see who are saying no to the cut at the rural health innovation center. That was a recommendation from the rural development council last year we've got it up and running. Actually about to kick them really into high year here over the next few weeks as we're rolling out some new and innovative ideas that I'll mention down here in just a second. 17.4.4 and 17.4.5 are two transactions that are linked together. One recognizing that one time funds were put in coming out and then one time funds going back in for a primary care health center in Wayne County and a school based primary care center in Irwin County. Eliminating one time funds put in last year at 17.4.6. 17.4.7. We've been working now, Senator Lucas and a bunch of folks on the Senate side as well as our own chairman Gerald Green have been working in Clay County trying to get a stable primary care environment down there. And so we're helping them here with a little bit of funding to get a clinic up and running there at 17.4.8. I'd mentioned the rural health systems innovation center above there. We're increasing the money that goes into the rural hospital stabilization grant program for some innovative ideas that are we're getting ready to roll out. And so you'll see the recognition of that there. Moving on to 17.5.4. The addition of two RN surveyors for nursing homes and two surveyors for other licensing is it relates to elder care. Many of you, I think we all saw the AJC research story that shed light on some deficiencies we have there. This is a recognition of the work, chair lady Cooper and many on her committee and others have done to recognize that issue and we're seeking to address it. 17.7.8 and 17.7.9 relate to our nursing homes within the state and some adjustments for J.C. accreditation and also for an increase in the vent bed rates that are paid for those patients around the state. 17.8.1 a true up of the projection there. Then moving down to 17.8.9 and 17.8.10. maternal mortality has been a huge issue in our state. It has it's been a topic of a lot of conversation. I don't know of anyone in this room that has has not had this is something that that's been bugging them that's been eating it them tugging at the heartstrings realizing the issues that we have across our state. 17.8.1 and we have a study committee worked over this past interim chair lady Cooper and many folks that have helped her representative Shannon and several others that have made this something that they're incredibly passionate about and we realize that. 17.8.1 and so this house with chair lady Cooper chair lady Cooper's bill that is I believe on the floor today that will take care for for mothers after birth from too much to six months of Medicaid coverage here we're recognizing 19.6 million and 250 thousand as well that will pull down a little over 60 million dollars to deal with the issue of maternal mortality. It's time we address it and that's what we're doing here. 17.8.11 a 1% reimbursement rate increase on 108 primary care codes 17.8.12 and 9.3 deal with silver, diamond, fluoride. As I said yesterday any of you that need to understand what that is grab chairman parish he'll be glad to explain but what it does it is a treatment for children's teeth their primary teeth that helps prevent cavities and we're just saying Medicaid will now help pay for that for those young newborns and toddlers. 17.12.1 under graduate medical education funding there for 185 new residency slots just to screwing up of that number. Then recognition of 17.12.2 for the F-Mount required adjustment there. Seeing no to the reduction at the accelerated track program at memorial health at 17123 then moving over to 17127. Allowing flexibility for a gust university in their strategic prioritized fellowships to allow them to recruit retain or realign to statewide campus partners throughout the state just saying to keep those funds in place for that. Then at 17129.10.11 saying no to those reductions to those programs as well. 1713.2.17.14.2 saying no to the reduction to the merger medical grant and to the more house school of medicine grants there for that partnership that we've had in place for over 40 years for those two institutions are helping educate and train primary care physicians across the state for rural and understatement. For rural and under served areas as well. 17151 saying no to the reduction in the long repayment program there. 17152 just an adjustment for actuals on the malpractice insurance premium program there. 17.16.2 you'll see the elimination of that cut as it relates to the capitation rate for students that are in undergraduate medical education as it refers to. There are a lot of things that are in the application as it refers to their capitation rate. And then at 17.17.3 just another insistence that this house feels that it's necessary to have a medical director position there at the composite medical board. Also and then under drugs narcotics at 1718 five you'll see again what we're saying that we feel very strongly about the data management system needs to be put in place there drugs narcotics as well. So we're going to see if you see supervision moving on the section 18 18.2.6 restoration of 11 sworn positions that were not vacant.

Moving on to now to Department of Corrections at section 19 19.2.13 and you'll see this throughout Department of Corrections. Some more of those targeted very specific pay increases in addition to the statewide 2%, but a 2% statewide to help address a 42% turnover rate in the Department of Corrections. You'll see this happened at 19.3.6, 4.4, 5.9, 8.22, and 19.9.8. Too much over time being worked, causes burnout and causes high turnover within the Department of Corrections. Moving on now to 19.5.8, a redirection of 3.4 million that was put in a couple of years ago to transition the health division of Department of Corrections over to electronic health records. They've not been able to make that transition just yet. However, the medical needs, the cost of medicine, providing medicine to those within the Department of Corrections has continued to escalate. So we're recognizing utilizing about 3.5 million dollars that already exist plus another 10 million dollars for those needs there at 19.5.8. Moving on to Department of Defense section 20, those are statewide 2% adjustments there. Section 21, Department of Driver Services, 21.1.6, just a reduction in the cut at that particular line, then at 21.2.5 a reduction in that cut, but also keeping in place the vault system at those high-risk, DDS facilities around the state and allowing for continued armor truck utilization as it relates to taking the cash money, receive checks, and other things that are received there at those installations to and from the depository institutions as well. 21.2.6, the restoration of 19 driver examiners to try to keep the lines as short as possible. And then again at 21.2.10 the recognition of a 39% turnover rate within driver services, a 2% targeted additional pay raise there as well. And then at 21.3.6, just an adjustment there and the reduction that was proposed. Section 22, decal. So you'll see at an elimination of a cut at 22.1.4 dealing with the CAPS program, or saying no to that to keep that availability to 125 children, that services actually about 50,000 children total throughout the state. Then at 22.1.5, the recommendation of Chair Lady Dempsey's committee a few years ago dealing with state infant early childhood mental health coordinator within decal and saying that we recognize that need. Then moving on down to 22.3.6, saying no to the reduction to the Georgia Family Connections partnership. Then moving, excuse me, saying no to reduction at one position that was thought to be vacant under pre-K specialists saying no to that cut. 22.3.10 is the first time you'll see throughout the budget the adjustment we made is it relates to teacher pay raises, taking it from the 2000 proposed by the governor to the 1000 proposed by the house so that we may go through and take care of many other issues that are within the budget that actually relate not only in the classroom to teachers but also to all 10.7 million Georgians. Then at 22.3.12, for the first time since 2011 you'll see the recognition of lottery funds there to add a thousand new pre-K slots and at 22.3.13 increased funds for classroom operations. Something hasn't been done since 2010, about 2.5%. And then for behavioral and classroom support specialists to assist lead teachers within the pre-K classrooms across this state there at 22.3.14. Under economic development you've got the statewide changes and then one change at 23.9.5. You'll see where we're saying we want to reduce the cut that was proposed to the Georgia Historical Marker Program reducing that to a $50,000 reduction instead of $100,000. Section 24 under Department of Education. Under Ag Education you'll see a few adjustments there but you'll also see the recognition that the committee continues to pay toward understanding and recognizing agriculture as number one industry in this state. And as I said yesterday morning in full committee we have a duty to help educate young people today where it is that their food and fiber comes from. Well the less than 2% of individuals engaged in actual agricultural production in this state it is mighty hard for folks to realize that milk doesn't come from the shelf at Croaker that there was a cow involved. The hamburger doesn't just come from the the Chiller section at Publix there was an actual cow involved and so that's what our ag education programs are so so good at doing across this state and I'm excited to see that we're going now into the urban areas for so many years we've kind of steered clear of the urban areas there's not been a whole lot of interest but it's exciting for me to stand here today and tell you that we're starting to see an awful lot of interest in the urban areas and we're allocating for that here within this budget. Then at 24.1.1 just allowing for the expansion of count programs at the two FFA counts, count John Hope and at Covington for the FFA and FCC LA counts and there's a programmatic staff there. 24.2.10 the addition for a budget analyst and grant manager position under the Business Finance Administration Program at DOE moving on 24.4.8 just the recognition of the charter schools facilities facilities grants and the growth there then under the chief turnaround officer you'll see a couple of transactions here and what we basically are doing is saying we're moving the chief turnaround officer program over to school improvement something that Superintendent Woods the state school board and the governor have been working on so we're just recognizing the movement of that program here under GNATs at 24.9.1 just a true up there again a true up at 24.9.3 for a decline in enrollment and then the adjustment on the salary schedule at 24.9.4 moving on to non-QBE grants hold harmless for the residential treatment facilities at 24.13.3 they're seeing a reduction number of students however it takes them a little bit of time to transition the teaching staff over to the new positions and to adjust that workload so we recognize in that and doing a hold harmless there then the other there's a reduction we could take at 24.13.6 as it relates to an RTC program manager position school nutrition saying no to the reduction in travel at 24.14.6 and then at 24.15.3 under preschool disabilities you'll see again the recognition of the teacher pay raise there people transportation 24.16.1 and 2 again recognition there of enrollment growth but also the hard work that many of our school bus drivers do across the state a targeted 5% increase as well there for local school system transportation employees under QBE equalization at 24.17 you'll see a true up under local five mil share again a true up there then at 24.19.3 the the big chunk of the teacher pay raise is recognized here and while it does say September 1st start date that is because there is a two month time lag on implementation but what it means is that every teacher will receive the full $1,000 would then FY 21 so don't let anybody tell you anything any different 24.19.4 just the recognition of some changes there is it relates state commission charter schools supplements charter school grant adjustments and again just some other adjustments and true ups for formula funding on down through there doing a hold harmless for school nurses at 24.19.8 and then one one thing I want to stop for just a second on here at 24.19.10 this is something that as we've talked about the teacher pay raise and I know that some folks are disappointed that we did a slight reduction there but we recognize that not everything deals with with trying to instruct the student a lot of it deals with climate in the classroom and the the things that are going on that are not instructional related and that's that's a lot of times issues that students are having and so several years ago in 2013 we passed a house bill 283 making the our recommended ratio of 1 to 450 counselors per students we've never had the opportunity to go in and fully fund that so you'll see here a recognition fully funding that counselor ratio of 24.7 million dollars to put those individuals within the school systems to help teachers as they manage those those students that are causing disruptive behavior moving on to recess at 24.20 you'll see there who are saying no to the cuts and then just doing one little salary tweak at 24.20.5 recess do a lot for our school systems across the state have widely varying program availability from one district to the next when it's something that every school system vitally needs 24.21.11 you'll see the transfer of the chief turnaround officer program over to school and improvement there and then a slight reduction at 24.22.1 under the State Charter School Commission admin another true up under state schools for training and experience at 24.23.5 and then saying no to the cut at 24.23.6 these state schools should have been exempt under the reductions just like QBE was they serve about 350 at the three different state schools and so we're just making sure that they're taking care of as I've said many times from this well we in many ways serve as their school board because they don't have a school board and that's what we're trying to do is make sure we're taking care of those those young people then moving on under testing at 24.25.7 just the recognition of the increase in growth for the one AP exam for free and reduced price lunch eligible students and one STEM test AP test for every student within the state section 25 under ERS you'll see just our yearly language to the board there at 25.4.1 saying please take into account the needs of our state retirees that haven't seen a cola and either if you're able to do the cola do the cola if not recognize and possibly do the thirteenths check like we've done for the last several years under forestry commission basically what you'll see here throughout this document of the statewide changes but at 21.1.6 2.4 2.5 and 3.4 moving on to 3.5 3.6 are basically true ups or lessings of reductions there so that they're still able to respond to forest fires and to continue to work with our forest industry across the state as it continues to recover from Hurricane Michael officers of the governor the statewide changes there but also one additional change at 27.6.8 just saying no to a proposed cut there under the professional standards commission to allow them to catch up on the workload where they were falling behind a little bit to make sure those cases are handled in a timely manner section 28 department of human services if you go over the first change not counting for the statewide changes you'll see show up at 28.5.1 restoring the money for the multi-agency alliance for children contracting the $500,000 utilizing $970,000 at 28.12 to implement the pilot program for closed foster care cases and then at 28.5.13 you'll see where we're targeting de-facts support service specialist to address the 36% turnover rate there providing an additional 2% on top of the statewide 2% there 28.7.12 again you see me standing here with a purple tie on today in recognition of dementia and Alzheimer's 28.7.12 is the program that we instituted a few years ago to help families across this state to be able to early diagnose and begin treatment for dementia and related issues and so we're seeing no to the reduction there as they are fully ramped up and rolling across this state. Moving on to elder and community living services at 28.9.2 saying no to that transfer of those over to elder support services at this time we do not feel that it's the proper this is the proper time to make that transition you'll see the flip side of that transaction show up at 28.10.4 28.12.6 we're seeing to reduce the cut that was proposed there on those case workers for the eligibility workers there about 1883 case workers currently in the state handling 1.5 million cases and that equates to about 774 cases per case worker and what we're doing there is giving them the slack in the chain to be able to try to hire more of those positions to to light network load and again to help reduce the amount of turnover that's being seen there in that agency. Under family connection at 28.19.1 reducing of that cut maintaining the accounting allotment at 48,500 per county and then saying no to the reduction at 28.19.2 you'll see the other statewide changes as you continue through there. Office of the Insurance Commissioner Section 29 at 29.3.6 you'll see where we're saying no to that transfer that we'd mentioned in DCA earlier legislation has not been introduced so we're still waiting on that to happen and then 29.4.5 and 4.4 and 4.5 I mentioned in banks and banking earlier about the industrial loans we're just saying no for the time being because again the legislation has not been introduced or passed. Section 30 GBI at 30.2.7 you'll see just a slight increase in the criminal background check fees of $2.25 going from $25.75 to $28 there then you'll see again the the state widespread on the salary increases but at 30.3.4 we're saying no to the reduction proposed there under forensic scientific services this will help them hire up the forensic biology scientists and the lab technicians to address the backlog that remains there under the testing program. Moving on to 30.3.6 and 3.7 again recognizing the need for testing at our crime labs across the state and fully standing up the new coastal lab and medical examiner office at Puer and then at 30.3.8 GBI had talked about doing some outsourcing of chemistry cases however no money had been proposed to do that we're coming in here and saying we're putting a million dollars in to allow for that outsourced chemistry testing maintain the biological testing with NGBI but allow for the chemistry testing to be done outside if they need to to free up space. Under reasonable investigative services at 30.4.5 just seem to replace some of those positions that have been taken there then the sexual offender registration review board at 30.4.8 where we said no a little bit ago on both positions being over there one has to remain at GBI so that's what we're recognizing there. Moving on over to criminal justice coordinating council you'll see there at 30.5.6 saying no to the reduction there on those individuals that help all of our drug courts and other of those specialty courts around the state in helping monitor those individuals coming through that program saying no to the reduction enforced there also saying no to the cut at 30.5.9 the the proposed cuts the local accountability court saying no to that at this point as well. This is an incredible impact financial impact to the state when every dollar we spend returns $7.74 to in some way to economic impact within the state so we're seeing no to those cuts. Moving on under juvenile justice section 31 31.2.8 so our juvenile correctional officers we talked about turnover and I mentioned 30 something percent I mentioned 40 something percent turnover rate within juvenile correction officers is currently 95 percent 95 95 percent where we're training folks they're working for us for a few weeks and then they're out the door we incur the operating expense of training only to lose them so we're doing an additional targeted 4 percent adjustment under on JCOs at 31.2.8 and you'll see that happen again at 31.3.13 and one more time you'll see it happen at 31.4.10 again a 4 percent on top of the 2 percent statewide change for those and you'll also recognize the changes on the teacher pay raise within Department of Juvenile Justice there then Department of Labor you'll see a language only added 32.4.6 that allows them to recognize some of their assessment collections for operation of their centers across the state Department of Law section 33 33.1.7 only change there is reducing the cut there to allow them to maintain five attorneys and eight support staff within the Department of Law section 34 Department of Natural Resources to keep up with the legislation we passed in this body last year 34.1.8 that allows actual commercial fishing of oysters there is the need for DNR to have a couple of marine biologists to support oyster aquaculture so we're recognizing that there you'll see the statewide spreads throughout that agency and then at 30 34.3.7 the addition of $500,000 to add to environmental engineers and allow for some third-party testing as it relates to the coal ash issue and any other environmental issues there may be within the state that need to be addressed that allows DNR and their EPD division to be able to fully do what it is they need to do there to handle that issue 34.6.5 just to true up in the amount there a reduction in the cut proposed at 34.7.4 also you'll see reductions in the proposed cuts at 38 34.8.5 8.6 and 8.7 8.7 is the recognition of the need at Lake Lanier for many abandoned vessels that partially submerged and it's something we've been doing now for the last several years it is a public safety issue up there on the lake one of the most visited lakes in the country as a matter 34.8.15 recognition that DNR will have some expenses incurred and taking over the operation of two historic vistas centers and trying to meet that need for them 34.9.3 under the Solid Waste Trust Fund another program that the RDC had had come up with last year the Blight Removent Coded Enforcement or Brace Program to assist very small communities and clearing up blight and doing community improvement it is something that fits under the purview the Solid Waste Trust Fund and dollars can be used to help with that then at 34.10.6 a parcel restoration of the cut there and at 10.7 and then at 34.10.9 just saying no to using House Bill 170 motor fuel funds for the operation of the Saplow Ferry to continue to use state funds for that operation. Parnson Peroles moving on to section 35 a true up at 35.16 a true up again at 35.24 and at 2.9. State Properties Commission no changes public defenders council section 37 section 37.2 excuse me they'll be back up 37.1.5 just to true up there then at 37.1.7 and 1.8 because public defenders do have a continuing legal education requirement those two lines are related to that training so we're saying no to the reduction there saying no to the reduction at 37.2.5 on the contractual reductions saying no to the hiring freeze at 37.2.6 because as we all understand in order to prosecute you have to have a defense chairman Welch and his committee chairman Welch in particular has been very adamant through the years of making sure that we maintain as best we can a balance there and I want to commend him and his committee for that because it's something that always sets it at forefront of their thinking as it relates to that and at 37.2.8 again the balancing in the juvenile courts for the assistant public defenders there then you'll see the annualization of the court cost at 37.2.9 and then the next five items are the excuse me including that one those items deal with the establishment of the new judge ships throughout the budget. Section 38 Department of Public Health. 38.1.6 the restoration of part of the cut there is it relates to sickle self-foundation allows for the telehealth program to continue and for the mobile testing unit to continue to be able to go around the state 38.1.7 reduction in the cut there to core services moving on to 38.3.7 just a slight adjustment there newer information from DPH on something that they could they could handle there under admin 38.3.9 transaction very similar to what we did in the amended budget as it relates to the Fort and County Board of Health you'll see that one show up again here at 38.12.13 it's just a bookkeeping shift 38.4.5 saying no in the reduction to travel and supplies under emergency preparedness felt like that it's probably not the time to be taking a cut there then at 38.5.4 saying no to the cut to the hepatitis C testing kits saying no to the cut at 38.5 for the Georgia Poison Control Center however capturing some savings available at 38.5.6 from consultant contracts moving on over to 38.8.6 the recognition of the crab disease Georgia newborn screening advisory committee and recognizing crab disease is one of the approved testing alternatives one of the testing protocols there and recognizing that and getting that started as well 38.10.3 environmental hazard control saying no to the reductions of those three positions in all Atlanta Albany and Columbus and then the meat of where we come to under public health is at 38.12.3 and that is lessening the reduction that was proposed from 9.2 million dollars to 3.8 million dollars for restoration of 5.4 million dollars to departments of public health within our counties it's very similar to what we did in the amended budget these are the folks that not only do restaurant inspections safety tank inspections out in the counties but in many cases they are the first line of defense we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute and then 38.12.4 just the flip side of the Fulton County transaction I mentioned earlier under the drama Georgia trauma commission at 38.15.2 actually saying no to that little over a million dollar cut there and adding another 594 thousand in recognition of the the new regional coordination center that is housed at Grady that handles the dispatching and of ambulances and their disbursement around the city as it relates to an accidents and traumatic events occurred as the emergency room situation happened at Emory is we're all aware I excuse not at Emory at Grady we all realized that we had a pre-mad shortage in ER beds at the number one trauma center in the southeast and so a grady with partners partnering with Emory and others set up this regional council to make sure that the right patient's getting to the right place at the right time and instead of something that I actually thought was already being done within the state but this is a model we're going to be looking out for a statewide rollout here in the in the coming months as well. Moving on to the Department of Public Safety looking at 39.4.4 just to true up for the actual numbers within the trooper schools and then at 39.4.7 recognising some savings that can be attained due to a trition during the trooper schools 39.5.7 you'll see what we're saying no to the use of motor fuel fees far the motor carry compliance division saying those are to be used for for paving and in contracts and the transportation department so we're seeing.

continue to use state funds in that category as well. 39.7.4 saying no to the reduction in the temporary progress monitors and evaluators for those those testing. Then at 39.8.8 saying no to the reduction in the contract with a sheriff's and our local police chiefs. Doing so would would call some harm to them in recruiting, but also at 39.9.9 and closing the central law enforcement academy, it would also make it more difficult for those agencies north of Atlanta to recruit and maintain individuals to go through the training. Reducing the cut at 39.9.6 under the training positions there, eliminating the cut at 39.9.7 on the public safety training courses and then a reduction in operating expenses, reducing that that cut there at 39.9.8. Then under office highway safety at 39.10.4 and 10.5 saying no to using the Joshua law funds for operating that they need to go to the actual scholarships and then taking a 4.5% cut out of operating of the governor's office highway safety. Under public service commission section 40, an addition of two investigators or inspectors at 40.2.3 for the call before you dig program, those inspectors basically bring in a two for one return there. So each one will bring in approximately double what their salary is a rent increase at 40.2.4. Again a reduction in the cut on operating expenses at 40.3.3 saying no to the reduction of contractual services and professional associations at 3.4. awful lot of information garnered from those national associations that allow for them to be able to use that research to have access to that research much cheaper rate than what it would cost us to do it in house. Reduction of the operating expense cut at 3.5 and then at 40.3.6 a slight increase in the rent that they're having to pay as well. Section 41 board of Regents. I'm going to try to make this one as simple as I can because there's nothing simple about it. But let me first start off with mentioning TRS and ORP as we came into session and we have we have since passed a bill that eliminates the the transaction that was in law between the optional retirement plan and TRS something that been basically not done since 99 or 2000. That swear also said that was not necessary an audit last year popped it back up on the radar screen because at that point that law was not taken off the book so it then appeared that it would be a liability again. We've moved forward on that legislation eliminating that liability so you'll see some reductions through the through the budget as it relates to that. Now as it relates to Ag Experiment cooperative extension and the other research and extension programs where there could be forestry or marine or skit away. We have gone back to the actual agency submission in many places and in some cases less than those reductions as it relates to Ag Experiment and cooperative extension because this body and the body across the building have worked awfully hard over the last several years to improve research and extension across this state that has offered by our research institutions and we felt like that it'd be regressive to go back and take deep cuts there at this point in time. So you'll see those restorations under Ag Experiment Station and cooperative extension. Then under the Athens and Tifton vet labs you'll see what we're seeing though to that transfer there that I mentioned when we were talking about the Department of Ag. Under the Enterprise Innovation Institute you'll see some changes in reductions there but then at 41.4.7 as it relates to invest Georgia we've been investing $10 million per year into invest Georgia. However as we started asking for information on that and how effective those investments had been we kind of came up short on getting that information so what we're doing at this time is pulling 5 million of that investment out and saying for the time being we're going to we're going to ease up a little bit make sure that we're understanding what all is going on and make sure that it's something that that we concur with and then we'll look at it as we go forward. 41.4.12 you'll just see the transfer of the innovation gateway and you'll see that show up again at 41.9.7 here in a second. Farch's required the extension as an end-farsher research as I mentioned lessening many of the cuts there going back to what the request and actually being are in some cases even less of a reduction. At 41.700 Georgia archives as you remember several years ago as we went into the recession we were looking everywhere to make reductions and in many places we've not made restorations and our Georgia archives is one of those in particular. We fell at this point they're basically at bare bones and in order to to maintain their statutory requirement on operating and being open for the public to use as the repository of state historical documents that it was necessary that we not take reductions there for the time being as well. Moving on to 41.8.4 on the cyber center just to true up on that number. 41.8.6 as it relates to the cyber security maturity model certification program or the CMMC Department of Defense does require certain assessments and certifications being placed for individuals doing either work for them or contract work for them and this is a partnership with the Technology Association of Georgia and as the Cyber Center has located there in August to Georgia to make sure that we're helping fill that pipeline of necessary needed employees. 41.9.7 you'll see the transfer I mentioned earlier of the $133,000 there and then moving on to the Marine Institute a restoration there. Marine Resources Extension say no to the cuts the medical college of Georgia Hospitalists and clinics remain are keeping those slots and salaries for the medical residency programs as 135 total slots that are still available there under public libraries and it's good that it's public library day I'm watching y'all as you bring in the Barstie Hot Dogs set down and eat in front of me that's just not fair. Nothing right about that at tall I'm just gonna tell you but you'll see some adjustments 41.14.4 a little bit more of a cut there as they've switched from Microsoft to Google and it's allowed for reduction there but a reduction in the cut at 41.14.5 which will allow them to continue to accept credit cards in their operations then moving down to 41.14.8 and 14.9 the restoration of operating funds at 14.8 doing a hold harmless there where the population projections were just a little bit off and at 14.9 going back to the position that we left here with last year of funding the materials grants at 35 cents per capita so we're seeing no to that reduction 41.15.8 and 15.9 is a restoration of funds for the Georgia Youth Science and Technology Center and the restoration of funds for the Center for Real Prosperity and Innovation 41.15.14 as I mentioned earlier in the Commission for the Holocaust that's where it would have been assigned to Kennesaw State we're seeing no designing it there but to put it as an attached agency that you'll see again here in just a second 41.16.9 that line also corresponds with 41.18.11 we're just saying no and the transfer of those funds out of teaching into Central Office we couldn't find where there were any savings or benefits by doing that transaction so we're seeing no to yet and you'll see that again in the Technical College System of Georgia as well you'll see the other the flip side of that coin at 41.18.11 moving on down to the Commission on the Holocaust at 41.21.1 is a recognition of it being an attached agency now then under George Military College just to transfer at 41.22 six over to 41.23.4 to put it in the right program as it relates to cameras and security at the institution and then a recognition at 41.22.7 of some liability that they have as it relates to the teacher retirement system. Department of Revenue look over at 42.8.6 first change there restoring five revenue agents and two auditor positions there and at 42.8.9 maintaining six of the contractors there as it relates to data mining and recouping of funds owed to the state of Georgia from fraudulent filings and otherwise. Section 43, Secretary of State change at 43.8.1 is the change you'll see there. That's the Georgia Access Medical Cannabis Commission just a true up of the funds there necessary to get it up and rolling. Under Section 44 student finance a true up of the numbers at 42 44.2.1 dealing with deal enrollment true up of the numbers at 44.9.1 of hope scholarships and then the recognition of the continued growth and success of the reach Georgia scholarship programs with the addition of two million dollars added there so that more local communities will be able to participate in that program. As I said yesterday if your school system and you yourself are not a participant in helping do the local match shame on you if your school system is not a participant shame on them that is one of the most impactful programs that I've seen in this state in a very long time. Section 45 teacher retirement system no changes. Section 46 the technical college system of Georgia you'll go down to 46.2.12 as it relates to the same type change that was mentioned over in the Board of Regents a while ago we're seeing no to that transfer then the next change will be over at 46.6.9 or the flip side of that transaction 4668 but 6.9 some additional funds for the Royal Technical Worker Pilot project and one of our representative Joneses we have two of those but representative Todd Jones has been working very diligently with the Technology Association of Georgia on putting some of these technology jobs out in rural Georgia and so this is what this is working toward is to make sure that the training is in place so those rural areas can supply the pipeline needed for those jobs. Section 47 Department of Transportation 47.1.2 the recognition of House Bill 170 funds that had been proposed to be used under the Motor Carrier Compliance division and checking with the the letter and the the feeling of the law House Bill 170 does not allow for those funds to be used that way so we're we're saying continuing to use state funds under Motor Carrier Compliance put the additional funds back in here for construction 47.2.1 the reduction and recognition of what actuals there and to balance motor fuel funds across the admin programs and then at 47.2.2 you'll see the 500 thousand that was proposed for Sapello being used there actually put in there for capital maintenance. Under construction admin at 47.3.2 at 47.42 4.2 5.2 9.2 10.2 and 11.2 you'll recognize the spread of the merit-based pay adjustments from last year actually being annualized into this year then the next change is at 47.12.3 the reduction of 10 million dollars in existing funds that are being used to recover those pay raises throughout the Department of Transportation as well. Section 48 Department of Veteran Services the statewide changes are all that you have there except for at 48.4.5 you'll see another target and increase 36 percent turnover rate for these field staff and so we're coming in and saying for these 111 officers that we do an additional pay bump there on top of the 2% statewide change then section 49 winding down section 49 State Board of Workman's comp you'll see the statewide changes as well. So that completes the walkthrough of the tracking document I want to make a few more comments I would say as a Baptist preacher an end-conclusion but we all know us good Baptist know what that means absolutely nothing. When the preacher said somebody's still awake. Somebody already in a varsity hot dog coma so bless your hearts but thank you for staying with me throughout the walkthrough of this document. It's taken quite a bit of time actually a little bit less I thought it would but I'm sure we're going to have questions I'm sure we're going to have folks that want to comment and make points about it and that's fine that's part of this process. There may be more changes in this document than any budget that you've ever seen there's certainly more changes in this document than any budget that I've ever seen but there are a few points that I want to roll back to as we get ready in prepared a vote. This budget reflects the intent and the fully funding of every special purpose fee that's ever been passed by this general assembly including fully funding Joshua's Law for driver's education, SuperSpeeder for Trauma Network, Solid Waste and hazardous waste trust funds for environmental cleanups, lifetime sportsman licenses in one year of outdoor stewardship for parks trails and conservation but most especially the house version of this bill insists on the integrity of the fees that were passed when we passed House Bill 170 in 2015 which creates over one billion additional dollars going to transportation and our infrastructure as it relates to roads and bridges. Your public safety committee subcommittee may change is to ensure that its systems and every county will have safe access to a public defender and the momentum of the criminal justice reform can continue with the full funding of Judicial and Justice and Senate grants and Accountability Cores. The 2.1 million restoration for these courts represent 16.4 million in cost of avoidance and at 75% rehabilitation rates for its participants. The subcommittee reworked the reductions and added funding for the GBI scientists and labs were turned integral part in clearing rape kit backlogs and other forensic evidence for speedy and fair trials and for those who must be incarcerated addressing the state employees 95% turnover rate and our juvenile facilities and 42% turnover rate adult prisons is a deliberate step to provide greater stability for our inmates at a lower cost by baiting overtime and duplicated training expenses. Every day safety of all of our citizens is important and the Economic Development Subcommittees recommendation to maintain 1 million in funding to guarantee the funding for the adequate number of food safety inspectors and Department of Agil culture were better able to make sure that the food we eat as sanitary and that the businesses that sell our food and fuel are hygienic and regulated. The consumer protection goes one step further than the house version of 793 with the restoration of 5.4 million for county health departments. The boots on the ground those responsible for regularly giving restaurant inspections. Those funds also help public health departments protect us through emergency preparedness and disease prevention. As we keep a watchful eye on coronavirus it is worth noting that county health departments are the primary health care provider for our neighbors in eight rural counties without a physician and the only support in nine additional counties where there's only one physician. The need for health care providers and namely physicians cannot be understated and our health subcommittee has invested years in building the educational and training infrastructure to meet that demand. The investment is reinforced by keeping 4.8 million within the medical education pipeline that we have created with our partners across the state. Morehouse, Mercer, Emory, Peacom, and our own Augusta University. It is a multi-prong effort and 10 million in grants to rural state hospital stabilization grants ensure that training can continue to occur in different settings around the state. And when you cast your vote today remember that we have addressed one very specific area of need maternal mortality. 19.7 million when matched with federal funding becomes 59.7 million and conjunction with chair lady Cooper's bill we're expressing our commitment to provide adequate resources to overturn the roughly 60% of senseless and preventable pregnancy related deaths in our state each year. Behavioral health has been a headline issue in our state for a decade as well. We've had tremendous leadership from the executive branch and our own human services subcommittee and building infrastructure and providing meaningful programming. This momentum must be maintained because we're already operating at maximum capacity and the demand just grows more and more every day. When you vote remember the additional the addition of over 30 million dollars for core behavioral health treatment which includes 95 crisis beds across this state and the 5,000 people who will need to use them in this coming year. 44 new beds and residential treatment of addiction and two crisis homes for children. We care for over 10,000 children on foster care system and the very least we can do for those children is provide a steady guide to advocate for them and protect them and to help them navigate the significant challenges that they face. That's why a case worker turnover has to be addressed and why our members proposed 2.4 million in salary increases to give our 1897 case workers the significant step to improve the 36% turnover rate and to lower the case load over time. And finally to each and every one of our 32,216 certified teachers and educational personnel we support your efforts and recognize the incredible service that you give to our state and especially our children. Although the governor said an expectation of $2,000 raised to the base salary to be funded in this coming year the house had to balance within this within the needs of our other state agencies and employees in our state. As a Georgia taxpayer this means we're looking out for you outside the classroom as well. This $1,000 increase and increase of 2% above the base salary on top of the $3,000 increase last year is an 11.7% raise in the last two years and I'm certain that the final 1,000 increase will be widely supported next year. In addition we also acknowledge and hear your requests for additional supports you need and the 24.8 million for school counselors will provide much needed assistance to you and your students and make your classroom a place where behavior management is not an issue but teaching can be done uninterrupted. Members of the House, Education is clearly our number one priority. Our teachers are the highest paid in the southeast. K-12 Education remains the largest single expenditure in the state budget totaling $10.7 billion. Our 44.3% of state general funds and the quality at basic education QBE formula will now be funded three years in a row providing local school systems and teachers with resources necessary to educate children in our Georgia schools. For that and for the painstakingly concerned comprehensive and cohesive efforts of the members of the House Appropriations Committee I repeat when I stated in the beginning of this presentation I am proud of this bill. I am proud of this bill because it incorporates the feedback from rural and urban, Democrats and Republicans, small government advocates and advocates for services. This bill reflects that we did our job of providing the checks and balances as a legislative institution more than any other budget that I have had the privilege of working on. This is the common denominator we share as House members and it shows in the thoughtful allocation of dollars in your vote of support for House Bill 793. Ladies and gentlemen thank you and Mr. Chairman if you're still awake back there I'll be glad to answer any questions. Mr. Speaker Mr. Chairman I've been on the edge of my seat for about two hour and a half now but what can I say? I'm glad you didn't fall off it and hurt you other on. There you go. Be a two-hour amended then. Mr. Chairman I can only thank you for your work personally and for your self-committee chairs on this budget and I look to your left and your right on the seat. I can see the incredible pride that the staff is taking in this budget and most of the times they shook their heads you were seeing things correctly. I saw a couple of nods there but a couple of times I was a I was a more. Thank you yes I had lots of questions before we started this your presentation but you answered every one that I had so thank you for that. Good but there are a couple of questions from the members if you'll be willing to take those. Yes sir I'm big glad to take a few. This time chair recognizes a repented Bruce to your right. Really gentleman you. Yes sir. The and I know this thing I just can't find it you know the whole tax cut piece is that in here. No sir that will not be recognized in this document okay that's actually a measure and an opportunity or function of the revenue estimate. Right I didn't know if it was reflected in here. No sir. No sir and we don't feel a need to because of many of the other things that this body has done and the Senate as well. Okay from marketplace facilitator and from our work on and and Chairman Knight and others work on pharmacy benefit manager legislation that we've been working on. I feel like that we more than adequately are going to have the ring that we need. Okay and one last thing the money for is there any money in here anywhere to address what we are currently dealing with in terms of this virus I didn't see that. Nothing specifically however if you'll go back to my comments that I made about the restoration of funding for County Public Health Departments and Public Health in general that will actually by lessening those cuts allow them to address any needs that they may have. Now we've also been in discussion with Dr. Tumey the Director of the Department of Public Health and she has told us at this point in time she doesn't see the need for additional state dollars because they already build emergency preparedness within their budget as it is whether it's flu or coronavirus or anything else there would be an outbreak and she is very confident that the federal dollars that have been approved will be addressing any of those additional needs that there may be. Mr. Chairman another question gentlemen from the 33rd chairman McCall to your right. Mr. Chairman Neal. Yes sir. Is it not true that this is my last one of these things I got to sit through and I kept up probably one of the three or four people in here that kept up with you line by line and I want to make sure that that I tell you and the staff thank you for this budget because it's a good one. Thank you. And I got a couple of questions about the largest industry in the state if you don't mind. Absolutely. You had mentioned the education of the urban kids and you talked about the milk cow and hamburger well the milk cow was involved but the hamburger cow was totally committed. It was committed. I like chicken and chicken and bacon to our egg and bacon. Right. To give us what we eat and is it not true that we put around $400,000 back in the agriculture department budget to ensure that the citizens of Georgia when they sit down to eat to hamburger or drink the milk that they have no worries at all about food safety. Absolutely and and and actually close to million by the time you take into account the targeted pay raises for those inspectors as well. And that's an important part that the citizens don't have to worry about their food supply. Exactly. We live in the nation that has the safest most abundant and lowest cost food supply in the world and it's done because we have a bunch of folks across the state that are deeply committed to making sure that that we're producing a crop and and marking a crop that's safe and affordable and then we have folks at the Department of Ag and the University System and others that help make sure that we're doing that in a way that that's the best on the environment and the safest for the consumer. And one more question if you'll let me. Yes sir. Under the Board of Regents under Extension and Research is it not true that if it wasn't for the commitment of Extension and Research and it's best of the farmers in Southwest Georgia that if we hadn't over the years done irrigation efficiency and they spent all that money on the irrigation systems that Florida would have whipped us in the water wars and that Extension and Research and no vague produces down there saved the whole state of Georgia. Absolutely. From from Florida. Absolutely. The College of Agriculture and Environmental Census Sciences stripping Rick Bell. I can't even talk now. He didn't got me toned tied. Stripping irrigation research farm has been priceless in helping us figure out a better way to use our water. We have more irrigated acres today than we've had ever in the existence of the state of Georgia and I don't know I can't say this as a fact but we may use as much as we've ever used. In general before we started putting in the the water saving devices but have added additional acres I would actually tell you that probably our per acre use and maybe overall consumptive use is actually lower than it was before any of those practices have been put into place. That's correct and all of those zeroes and smaller numbers inside the parentheses on the house version on the Extension and Research is very important and thank you very much. Yes sir. We appreciate the gentleman sharing their conversation of the curse between seat mates but that was very informative. Thank you. To your extreme right Mr. Chairman the gentleman from the six Representative Ridley has a question. I'm maybe. I'll take it easy on you. Is it not true that this budget

reflects not only the governor's priorities, but also the priorities of this house's independent body. Yes, sir. Absolutely. And I mean, you know, we go through the document. We talk about the changes. We don't necessarily always highlight those things that we're agreeing on. And of course, the work on the game task force and sex trafficking, all of those things that the governor and the First Lady are so near and dear to their hearts and making sure we're doing it. We treat all of those things. It's a lot of other stuff that are priorities of the house that we've gone in and made additions to or changes to as well. So yes, it represents an awful lot of agreements with the governor's priorities. All right. And thank you. I appreciate you working. I know you're going to do it later, but you got one of the best staffs I've ever seen. Amen. Amen. Mr. Chairman, now we'll recognize a gentleman from the 143rd represented Beverly to your front for a question. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, you? Yes, sir. A couple of questions. Number one, does the budget contemplate placing money into the Medicaid waiver program? It does on the maternal mortality piece, yes, sir. But not for the waiver as it's written? Not yet, because that will depend on the federal decision. And then we will address that more than likely when we come back next January. Okay. Gentlemen, further you. Yes, sir. Last year, the anticipated revenue growth for the budget was approximately, do you remember what that percentage was? About 3.5, almost 4%. And what was it actually? What we anticipated 3.5, or what did it turn out to be? 3.2, 3.3, some are thereabouts. Okay. I thought it was more around 0.6%. That we had a revenue shortfall, not what we anticipated. This budget contemplates the gentleman for other years. Does it contemplate what type of revenue growth do we anticipate? About 2%. About 2%. Thank you. Yes. To your extreme left, the gentleman with 158th representative parish has a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a couple of questions for you, please, sir. Yes, sir. Isn't it true, Mr. Chairman, in this budget, that we have added items that have helped to address some critical needs, such as maternal mortality, assistance to our rural hospitals, and we've added funds in our graduate medical education program to help us increase the number of doctors and health care workers in this state, so that our communities in our rural areas and the urban areas will continue to thrive. I will tell you that the gentleman asking the question knows better than anyone in this house, that that is true. Can I ask one more question? Yes, sir. Is it not true that I want to thank you for restoring funds to these programs that were reduced, that this house had put priorities on over the last several years in an effort to build up these programs that we were just talking about so that all Georgians would have access to quality health care around this state, and that our families and communities can continue to have a good quality of life. Yes, sir. It's been a team effort, for sure. To your left again, Representative Hogan from District 179. Thank you, gentlemen and you. Yes, sir. I want to thank you for what you've done in your staff in this budget. It's been the most comprehensive budget that I remember. And I'd also like to, I think I remember you seeing something about $200,000 from Marine Balan just to move oyster farming forward, so I appreciate that very much down on the coast. And it'll mean a lot for the state of Georgia, so thank you very much. Absolutely. Mr. Chairman, I'll take a couple more if there are. And then I want to retire to my seat and allow us to take a vote. The hour is getting a little bit late, and I know there's probably something that we wish to speak on the budget, so I don't want to take a poll of their time. You're wise, man. I'm going to pick and choose a couple of here, Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind. But I'd like to recognize this gentleman for a question from the one hundred and tenth district, Chairman Welch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, do you yield? Yes, sir. It's not true that this budget strikes the proper balance between in our justice system, preserving the rights of those that need criminal defense, balancing also the need for us to have a well-founded and well-established prosecutorial pool of attorneys. Yes, sir. And you and your subcommittee for the last several years have done an outstanding job in making sure that that balance is in place. It is a gentleman for the year. Yes, sir. This is budget also preserve and not backtrack from the accountability courts and preserving the grants that we have anticipated also looking at juvenile justice grants as well so that our local governments continue to provide the services and defer those individuals that may still be able to be to their families, pay taxes, maintain their jobs without being shunned into our criminal justice system before that's necessary. Absolutely. For the yield. Are you cross-examining me or? I know we only get this last time, so yes, sir. Yes, thank you. One last question. Is it not true that through your leadership and the empowerment that you've provided me as a subcommittee chairman and the members of my subcommittee, as well as the leadership and tireless hours of work that your staff or house budget research office has put into this budget? Is it not true, sir, that I'm deeply honored and grateful for all of their work and all of your leadership and it's been my pleasure to serve with you as your subcommittee chairman? Well, it's been a pleasure to have you as a subcommittee chairman and I don't know about my leadership. Sometimes I feel like I'm taking a dog for a walk and just hanging on to the leash at a run. Sometimes you kind of lean from behind and that's what I try to do and I'm incredibly fortunate to have the eight of you that serve as subcommittee chairs, our vice chairman and secretary of our committee that consistently and constantly had my back in the backs of our staff and we're certainly incredibly blessed to have the staff that we do. As I said yesterday morning, I'll put them up against any budget staff in the 50 states for that matter in any country in the world because there's some of the hardest work in most of the nation's young people that I've ever known. Thank you. One last question, Mr. Chairman, and then we can move on, but I would represent the lady from the 13th Chairman DiPse for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Absolutely. While there have been lots of accolades and we could all stand here and do that repeatedly, there will never be enough words to really say about this budget. It was a process that none of us I think expected or knew exactly how to face. But I think each and every member in here has so much to take home, to go back into our districts and to be grateful for, to talk about and to be proud of the work that we as a house have done, is that not true? Absolutely. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. And I think specifically much of the work in behavioral health, developmental disabilities, addiction, or foster care, or veterans, when you look at the funding that went there, the dollars that went across those agencies to actually work to meet the needs of some of our most vulnerable Georgians is so very, very important. Does the gentleman agree? Yes, ma'am. I certainly do. And one more thing. If this budget does not directly impact each of you sitting here and privileged to be here, how would you say, look around, think about your neighbors, your family members, your friends, people across our Georgia will truly benefit from this at this time. Is that not true? Very well said. Very well said. Mr. Chairman, I will yield the well and ask that our members support and vote for the Committee of the House Bill 793 as we move forward. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as you leave the well, I want to thank you for having a very sharp intellect when it comes to fiscal policy. Thank you for that. But even more so, thank you for your temperate and your temperate work on this and our budgets tempered by compassion and the service heart. Thank you. Chair Nell would recognize the gentleman for emotion. Mr. Chairman, I move that this House, Fancy House Bill 793 as a Committee Substitute. The gentleman has moved that this House passed 793 by Committee Substitute. I hear a second. Chair, recognize the gentleman from the 33rd Chairman McCall. Yes, sir, I'd be happy to second the motion. Representative McCall has second the motion. At this time, the question on House Bill, at this time we'll call the question on House Bill 793, all in favor of House Bill 793 will say yes. I'm glad you're paying attention. All opposed will say no. It's clear that the yeses have it and House Bill 793 passes by Committee Substitute. And the Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 16th and 16th Chairman England. As chairman of the Committee of the whole House, you're instructed to report the action of the Committee of the whole House to the House. The Chair recognizes the majority leader Burns. Mr. Speaker, the Committee of the whole House has had on the consideration House Bill 793. And it has instructed me as its chairman to report the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 793 do pass by Committee Substitute. The report of the chairman of the Committee of the whole House is received. The Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 793 and has reported the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 793 do pass by Committee Substitute. The Committee of the whole House is hereby dissolved. For what purpose does the majority leader of the House rise? Mr. Speaker, I'd like to recognize the make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker, I've moved that we table House Bill 793. What the majority leader has moved that House Bill 793 be placed on the table for what purpose does the majority caucus whip rise? Mr. Speaker, I'd like to second the motion that we table House Bill 793. The majority caucus whip has seconded the motion. Is there any objection to the motion? Hearing none, it is put on the table. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Rules Committee for an announcement. Rules will meet at two o'clock. Two o'clock, don't be late. Thank you.
