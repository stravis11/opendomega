Good morning.
>> Good to see all you early risers for
sure. What a great day the House is
having. We're moving fast here and
efficiently. So, let's get started on
the human resources
budget changes. 15.3.
This is under behavioral health and
developmental disabilities. And this is
the only change to the governor's
proposal. This will be for one-time
funds for a behavioral health provider
rate study. This focuses on the now and
comp waiverss.
So next,
if you would look at the Department of
Human Services,
28.3.1,
this will provide funds for an
integrated child welfare reporting
system, something that we have needed
for a great time in Georgia, $15
million.
The next is at 28.12.1
for out ofome care.
This will increase the funds for
utilization growth and increased costs
of care prioritizing
reunification services assessments and
the specialized services for our high
acuity youth. This will
rebuild some of what is missing there.
This will be an ad of 82 thou 80. Excuse
me. We're all running dashing. I'm
sorry. Sorry. 82741347.
28.13.1
for out ofome care. This is a special
project to restore the cancellation of
state office contracts for supportive
services
and implement funds to place foster
youth closer to their biological
families as directed in the FY26 budget.
This is a million 599601.
Next, if you would look please at
28.25.3
25.3
to increase the funds to supply new and
used durable medical equipment and
assisted technology. This is for the
friends of disabled adults, children and
youth FODAC, a longtime partner with our
state of $125,000.
That is all of that budget. Now, if we
would look at veterans services.
So, there are a couple of things here
and they are helping each other out. I'm
going to look at some other notes that I
have here just a minute to make sure I
say this correctly. Okay. So, at 48.2.3
and 48.3
you will see that there are funds moving
there.
The governor proposed transferring funds
from nursing homes to the cemetery. The
house is going to say no and actually
add straight up funds for um for the
cemetery of a million dollars. This is
the funds to create the new veteran
cemetery in Augusta, Richmond County,
pursuant to HR77.
That is 48.2.4.
Also at 48.3.4,
We're going to recognize savings from
the delay in the opening of new beds.
There's a cost savings here. There are
17 beds that still remain open. And so
we are going to save a little bit of
money there.
Then if you'll look at 48.4.3,
this will be to provide funds for
technology platform for our community
service referral. Unite us is a social
service platform that has been working
very successfully with our veterans and
we want to continue to support them with
2,614
$598.
And then last at 48.4.4
we're going to partner with the Shepherd
Center initiative. They are doing great
work to help with some of our military
veterans and wounded ser service members
particularly and mental health and brain
injuries. So, we will be um sending a
million dollars that way in the House
budget. Thank y'all so much.
