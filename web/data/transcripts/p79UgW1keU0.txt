And the records, if she wouldn't mind,
wouldn't mind saying prayer for us are you putting them six okay all right let us
pray dear God thank you for letting us all be here today Lord I pray that you
will use use us to do your work for the people of Georgia God be with our
farmers and our producers Lord I know that we've had some serious weather issues
that have affected our states crops and I pray that you be with those farmers and
and those families, God, and let them understand
that it's your plan, not ours.
Thank you for the work we do in this committee,
and thank you for the people I had the privilege
of just observing with, your name, I pray, amen.
Thank you, man.
All righty.
Well, today we have our friends from the George EP there,
gonna come here, and I think sort of allow our committee
to hear some of the same testimony
that you all provided to the House Agricultural Committee.
So, Mr. Cliff, I think you're going to...
Cliff, it's just for Rachel here.
Do you mind telling her your full name
and what you do at EPD?
I'm sorry, say it.
Yes.
Cliff Lewis with Georgia Environmental Protection Division,
specifically the Agricultural Water
with Draw Permitting Program Manager.
Appreciate the opportunity to talk with the committee today.
Wanted to go over some of the things that I spoke with,
spoke about in the House Committee, as you said,
Mr. Chairman, and that gets into the permitting moratorium
that we currently have on in the Flint Basin,
with regard to some of the surface water uses
and some of the flood and groundwater
uses in that basin, and I believe some of the ARPA, the American
Nebraska Recovery Plan project that we're doing, and obviously
we'll take any questions at any point.
What the agricultural permitting program does for George
EPD is it permits water withdrawals for farm uses.
Anything over 100,000 gallons per day, or a pump size of
of 70 gallons per minute would require a permit
that typically comes down to farmers and golf courses
for our program.
And in July 30th of 2012, we had a suspension,
then Director Judd Turner implemented a suspension
on agricultural water withdrawal permits
and portions of the lower flint and the Chattahoochi River Basins.
Specifically, as of that July 30th, 2012 date,
DPD no longer considered accepting any applications for ag water withdrawal permits in that lower flint
Basin it affected applications for new permits for withdrawals from the Florida aquifer and for surface waters
In the area known as we commonly referred to as sub area four
That's the affected region where surfacing groundwater interaction
Has been modeled extensively and shown to be
Essentially the same water given their close proximity to one another
But the applications for new withdrawals from the Florida
and aquifer are not accepted.
Applications for existing permit modifications
that would increase either the pump capacity
on that permit or the irrigated acreage
that was allowed under that permit also has not been accepted
since that time.
Applications for permit modifications
that would increase pump capacity
or irrigated acreage in spring creek, itchway,
notchway creek and the kitchen boonimucleic creek subbasins of the Flint River Basin were
affected as well as the applications for new permits in those three subbasins of the
Flint as well. Permitting in other parts of the Flint Basin
Chattahoochubation has continued since that that moratorium and also unrestricted aquifers
such as a deeper aquifer has been made available to those that want to use water in that
basin if that aquifer was available at that location. The reason for that
moratorium is because the water resources in that basin that are affected by
the suspension is such a significant source of water for irrigation. The farm
gate value of that region is the largest in the state. It's our bread
baskets for as agriculture goes, but continued increase in water with
draws over time as shown that maybe there's some concern
in some areas, whether it be for some species or for
low flows in some of the rivers and streams in some of our
downstream stream neighbors.
Protecting existing users is something that
the EPD is statutorily bound to do.
And so any existing user in an area that is being looked
that for additional water withdrawals has to be considered
and is considered in all of our models.
So if you have a permit in that area,
You have certainty in that your irrigated acreage and your pump capacity and your investments
are protected.
Is that something that we've had to take a look at?
So it wasn't just a matter of what's coming into the system and say, what do we have in
the system and how do we manage that and then how does that connect to what we might have
in the future.
But suspending the consideration of those permit applications in the area has really allowed
the EPD to take in a lot of new information, a lot of data over the years since that implementation
and update the tools that we use in the management of natural water resources in those basins.
And we continually assess the water resources in those basins and in that region to evaluate
the potential for impacts.
So that was the reason for the moratorium in the beginning and it was essentially just
to make sure that that being such an important area for Georgia and an important area for
the water resources and for the needs of those that were already permitted we needed time
to take a look at.
What was out there, how it was impacting the natural resources in that region and what
steps we might need to take as far as data that we need or information that we might need
to consider.
That's what's been happening since that moratorium has been implemented in July 2012.
We are still under that moratorium.
When we get applications, we do not take applications for a Florida aquifer withdrawal or service.
We do talk to that applicant about any potential for other water resources.
We're pretty successful at doing that, although the costs have increased dramatically to move
to deeper aquifers, and the Florida aquifer is the more shallow than where our alternatives
are now, but we do have alternatives for those who want to get into the system to continue
to get into for now.
Next thing I'll talk about is the Agricultural Water Source Conversion for Streamflow Resilience
project. That project is a partnership with the Georgia EPD, the Georgia Water
Planning and Policy Center and the Golden Triangle Resource Conservation and
Development Council and the goal of this project is to increase agricultural
water supply reliability and better protect the surface waters during during
drought periods. How this is going to happen is we're going to convert surface
water withdrawals in that lower flint basin to deep groundwater sources,
essentially taking the users off of surface water in the worst of times or in
the dryness of times and having them move to more reliable and less impactful on
stream flows and have them move to groundwater. This is a $49.8 million
award by the American Rescue Plan Act 2021 and imitations were sent out to
participants who were offered to, who had existing surface water permits in the subbasins
of the lower flint and offered to have a call share program, 90% of a deep will installed
for them if they would agree to conditions on their surface water permits to be modified
to only to use to switch off of those surface water permits and move to groundwater use during
times of drought. The existing surface water withdrawal permits are modified so that
those drought conditions take effect, those drought conditions, they would be notified
of when those were to take place and notified when those newly permitted groundwater sources
in the deeper aquifers are to be used instead of the surface water sources.
and then install 242 deep groundwater wells
at the site of the surface water withdrawals.
Can we do that or not?
I mean, when we proposed this,
the prices of things were not what they were today,
and that was the number that we projected,
so we're still trying to move forward towards
putting in as many as we can,
but the costs have increased since this plan was
quite developed.
It's a five year implementation timeframe on this project.
We've got a project advisory board that was selected by the Water Planning and Policy
Center and vetted by EPD.
The project area for this is the lower Flint Basin and specifically in that 2012 suspension
area that I mentioned went into effect in July 2012, 2012.
Again, no new or increased surface water use and no increased use or new uses in the
Florida and aquifer. The initial focus of this has been implementing that in the itchway,
notchway creek, subbasin of the lower flant specifically because of water planning and
policy center had done so much work there, not always at a ripe area geographically and
hydrogeologically, but they had already done a lot of work in that where their mapping
had basically given us a leg up on the information that we had there and we were able to leverage
that information with better use of the funds and a better project.
In that project area there's 370 new Clavern wells and the Clavern aquifer is not a restricted
aquifer, it's a deep rock for the Florida aquifer.
The Florida is more shallow and it is typically more productive.
It is all limits.
The Clavern aquifer is something that new applicants currently do have the opportunity to put
in. As I said, it does cost a more to get these wells, but it is not, it is an option for
current users in the Flint Basin. There's going to be 16 monitoring wells installed. Those
monitoring wells are going to collect hydrologic information as well as water chemistry information,
and all of that data is going to assist us in better understanding and managing the water
resources in that basin as well as to aquifer withdrawal capacities that exist and how that
plays into the regional water capacities, you know, outside of that basin. We also, you
know, we share that aquifer with Florida and Alabama, and that's not just confined to
that area, so it's spread out, and we all have drinks in that. We all have straws in
that drink, but we need time to better understand how that plays, how that localize impact,
and it spreads out, and what type of regional impacts it may have. Monitoring equipment
is going to be installed in those monitoring wells and those, you know, that work is soon
to begin the contractors are being put together and information being put together for them
to go out and begin that as we speak. We definitely need more information on the deeper
aquifers in that project area. Like I said, they're more expensive to drill to the Clavern
aquifer, and the yield is not as much as it would be in the Florida.
But we do have limited data in the project area.
So it's very difficult sometimes when whether a well-driller calls or an applicant to put
something in calls that, hey, I want to put in some well and grow blue berries or whatever
you want to grow.
And they say, how much water can I get there?
Well, we don't know.
And we can't promise you anything other than the fact that yields probably spend a lot
of money getting your answer. And that's about the best we can do until we get more data.
And that data is going to come from this project and it's going to come from those monitoring
wells in that area. Geology and aquifer characteristics by a team of University of Georgia
professors working with us. They're improving the workforce readiness for our project
and supporting student training on some of this stuff. And we have undergraduate ground
water technicians working on some of this stuff as well as some graduate ground water
professionals working on as well.
So it's not just an EPD working on that.
We have some really broad perspectives and some very, very hydrologically inclined experts
working on this project.
The long-term monitoring of hydrologic effects of reducing surface water withdrawals during
droughts is what we're trying to do.
those targeted outcomes of this project include 50 cubic feet per second or more flow benefit
during drought.
And I want to talk about a flow benefit for just a second because you may hear that turn
from your constituents.
We hear it from those we want to, you know, we talk about it with those that won't
know withdrawals, but something that we're, you know, looking at in this system is what
type of flow benefits we get from different management activities and by flow benefits
I just simply mean how much flow, how much water can we keep in the stream, how much can
we keep in for the critters, how much can we keep in for the flow of that hydrologic system,
how much flow do we keep in there for all of the users, and how do we continue to protect
those that currently already have a permit to use.
Again, getting improved data on those deep aquifers, we're going to have two augmentation systems
operating in spring creek. We currently have one that was damaged some time ago by Hurricane
Michael and that was put into wet the muscles during drop areas. We're going to have two.
The one that was existing was damaged during Hurricane Michael. This project is going to get that
back up and running and get it operational as well as get another well put in so that it can dump
into the creek to ensure species protection.
Habitat Conservation Plan is another goal of this project.
The Habitat Conservation is something
that EPD's providing technical support
on to the Water Policy Center.
And we believe that through the Habitat Conservation Plan
that the future permitting Florida
Noggle for Surface Waters in the Flint Basins,
the habitat conservation plan may offer a good opportunity for vehicle for the state to
in the future have some potential to open up some of those areas that may be restricted
now. Doing an updated survey on freshwater mussels in that region and having improved
demand management like conservation easements and suspension initiatives and incentives
excuse me is something that's being looked at as well. Source water conversion I talked
about, you know, converting some of these surface water sources to ground water.
And that being a cost share program.
But that source conversion will decrease the adverse impacts on stream flows
and during periods of drought.
It's going to provide farmers with more reliable sources of water.
And it's going to leave water into the rivers and streams for downstream users
in aquatic ecosystems, recreation opportunities, and other water quality protection.
It's also going to improve the resilience of the regional economy, the potential shocks
from the drought and the decrease in its exposure to conflict and the litigation that we
have faced in the past, which is important to have favorite outcomes and a lot of those
favorite outcomes in that litigation due to the management activities that the state
had implemented.
They're going to be more metering or use metering under this project and ensure that the proper
use of these sources are used at different times, that being whether it's the normal periods
of climate or drought periods to make sure that these users are in compliance and make
sure that the existing users are protected and their infrastructure is not impacted by
any of these changes in any of these source swaps.
We're going to have data that's supported for future analysis of resource utilization
and sustainability and also moving towards telemetry meters.
Right now we use micrometer propeller meters and what that means is they have an opportunity
to break and get damaged and get sediment in them and all kinds of stuff goes through them.
But at the end of the day it means that I've got to send somebody out there to walk up
to the meter and actually look at it and look at the number.
The telemetry is going to be much more efficient, it's going to save us from having to send
people out to these things and all these sites and running around and actually be able
to read it just through a data download.
You can do a data download and not have to send,
you know, physical presence on people's land
like we have to do now.
So just moving into better technology
and that'll help us with compliance
and understanding compliance better
and also be able to help us to have a better understanding
of form operations on some of these forms
that are using this telemetry and work with these land owners
Um, to meet their needs and their questions.
Mr. Chairman, that's all I have prepared.
Do you have anyone has questions?
Yes, sir.
Uh, Senator Watson, what number are you?
Okay, we got a lot in that.
We got two of them a lot in that here.
Uh, Senator, go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for being here. Cliff, appreciate all the work you are doing and I know we've
got a lot going on down there but we've I guess also not had a lot going on. I know the
moratorium has been in existence now for almost 11 years and I know 11 years ago it was
told that we would evaluate it annually. Is that still done? When is it evaluated and
And if it's evaluated, where's the information on that?
So the original announcement and intent was to have an annual November review of our
information.
I think that our technology, our information, better resources that we have has really
increased what we know over the last ten years.
We've had a major influx of information, our modeling tools are pretty amazing.
We have incredible experts that are doing these things.
And to say that we evaluate every November, we wouldn't be doing it just as we do.
We evaluate it probably, you know, I know you can't geologically evaluate something every
month, but we look at this information constantly and we talk about it constantly and we talk
about what are we doing right, what are we not doing, what do we need to pay attention
to and I certainly wish we do it best we can and we could probably do a lot of
things better I'm sure we never have enough time and people and all that like
everybody else to do exactly what like we want to do it but that's how we we
put our heads together all the time internal try to do the best we can with
speaking to stakeholders increasing those discussions talking with people who
may want to put an application but like I said we can't take an application
because of the moratorium. What is it that you need? What is it you trying to do? Are there
opportunities to redesign systems or look at new operational efficiencies that maybe we're not
looking at? So that's kind of what we're trying to move into is to talk to some new people about,
hey, what are some new things that maybe what do we miss? Is anything we need to look at?
But we're continuously looking at that even though the formal announcement back in July 30th,
the 2012 on the implementation that moratorium said it was in November. But that information
rest in a number of different places. I have, you know, some with our ag permitting program and
we work with our hydrologic unit who has information on the models. We have our metering program
and our hydrologic unit that also has information on metered water use. So, in the watershed
protection branch of the division would be where all of that information would be held.
Okay. Well, I know you've got a lot of extra help behind you, but I mean, what,
What did we say we were going to evaluate it and what are I mean I just you know we've got
farmers down there that have waited patiently technology has changed there are a lot more
efficient and we're still just sitting on a moratorium. We've you know heard rumors of
possibility of opening things up and some areas for different reasons and then that all of a sudden
disappeared and now we've all said and got a bunch of money so obviously some
things are starting to happen again but you know we've got farmers that have
whales that may not be permitted have acres that may not be registered or set
up or in the database and they just want to be compliant. Everybody knows
they're irrigating and they've been irrigating for 11 years. We just want
everybody, we need to be collecting that data. I mean, it just makes sense. But we won't
let them come into compliance. We still won't let anybody drill. And we're sending out letters
to them from the APD, telling them that they need to get in compliance. They don't know
how to get in compliance. Some of them can't get into compliance. And it may not be their
fault. And it's like, but we all have new technology. Everybody's been talking about
But what does it truly mean when we're going to reevaluate the moratorium?
I think one of the things that we, in one of the things that we've been doing is we've
experienced an explosion in that technology with regard to GPS systems and GIS, geographic
information systems and satellite imagery.
It's allowing us to see what's going on.
It's allowing those that users and permit holders to submit information to us faster.
So that's where it all begins is in those locations and that's where everything that we do
starts.
So when we re-evaluate the moratorium, we start looking at just how surface water and
groundwater are connected to one another in that basin and that changes based on the
year, whether it's drought year or whether it's not.
But for the information that we've had and collected over the past decade, I think it's
scientifically proven that water is basically the same water once you get into those lower
flint basins and if you take from over here it can impact the surface flows, if you take
from the groundwater here, if you take from the surface water it's certainly a one-to-one
impact and I think that one of the things that we have done really well over the last
decade during this moratorium period is improve the modeling and improve the data and
So what that is telling us is in the areas that are their new areas,
one of the things we're looking at is are there new areas that maybe that there are capacities
that could be tapped in the future.
So that's something that APD has been looking at.
And some of the modeling results have been positive with the potential to look at other areas
that may have capacities in the Flint Basin to continue to permit.
And that said, it's more to it than just the hydrology of it, and that being there being
some sensitive, you know, for federal endangered muscles in that region, most of our permits
are from that region.
So that region has a hot spot, and it's very important for us, from a hydrologic standpoint,
from a far, very distant point, and it's also important to the existing users that we
have to protect and our downstream neighbors that we have to protect and also the critters.
So there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables that have to be looked at and that's
pretty much what we've been doing past 10 years.
So I'd say those modeling results are really, really good because a few years ago we didn't
have that positivity that we have now and it's not that we were negative about it, just
we didn't have the data.
We've gotten a lot better over the last 10 years.
All right, Senator, if you don't mind, Senator Sam's life has been blank and censures was I'm I'm going to
Okay, well if you don't if you don't mind Senator Eccles's life's been flashing for a while to Senator Eccles
Thank you, so I I farm in Northeast Georgia, so I don't have these problems fortunately
But so I'm listening to you say that you know you're collecting data. We've
said a moratorium. I don't know because I'm new here. What was the
criteria to establish this moratorium? How are we reporting to that? And then
also what is the criteria to lift the moratorium so that we can you know
make a plan and move forward? Not just continued to collect data because
Because that is great, but what are we doing with the data we're collecting?
Yes, so what generated that, the moratorium was certainly the evidence that streams are
going dry and they have going dry, but we've seen them start going dryer longer and
they're going dryer faster and stay in dryer longer in that region.
So the models have shown us what that has looked like and what that trend has been over
the past few years, and what that showed is there's potential for adverse impacts with
the irrigation that is out there, and just really needed to take a look at how we manage
it, and that came in the form of Flint River Basin when we had an original moratorium in
1999 to 2006, that was originally lifted with a 2007 Flint River Basin plan, which took
all this stuff to a similar situation. What I'm talking about right now, that we collected
over those decades, or that decade of proximate decade during the moratorium, put all that
into the plan and decided, hey, these are the management practices that we need to implement
moving forward. And one of the things we did with this moratorium was any application that
was submitted before the implementation date was still processed. So all of those are
still, there's still a few that are still going through that process. So there were still
people that came online, came into the system after that.
They were people that had applied for it beforehand, but that was really just the adverse impacts
for the potential for adverse impacts in the lower Flint Basin.
Because that surface water and groundwater is so close together and so tightly connected,
we just needed a better understanding of how the withdrawals that we currently have in
any potential future withdrawals may impact that.
So that was the genesis of that, you know, the idea of how do we come out of this?
I think that we believe that through the work we're doing the partnership with the Water
Policy Center, having to have conservation plan and working through that may offer us
a future of being able to open up or consider potential withdrawals in that basin in a different
way than we have now.
So that's what we believe is part of the solution for sure.
definitely just better models continue to talk about what our practices are
currently and if we can improve those that would be the future for us. Senator
Sims?
the privilege that you have to be mindful of, I don't know,
especially a little bit.
Downscrains hold from our farmers and upscrains hold
the blitz, but the red water flows downscrains too.
So there are a lot of uses, but there is as well
a taking from the area of farm.
This is a square year from water close to 12 years.
data collecting, their analysis, those kinds of things.
But we are 80 billion dollar industry.
Ag is an 80 billion dollar industry.
And once you put those very stringent stipulations
on our ag community, then tell me what we're going to do.
How will you report or propose for our ag industry
to be productive and thrive, if they have a clear bit of warrant for it and there is no,
is there any, any plans in sight for us to save and these individuals that are represented
in the act and reveal that we are going to be recognized what their situations are right now.
What can I say on my phone in public schools?
Certainly, one of the things I mentioned is EPD's statutory directs to protect existing
users of that $80 billion, $80 billion is something that we have to protect and something
that we have to use our management activities and our policies that we use to protect
that.
So, that's one thing is we want to protect that $80 billion, so there's that.
preserve that. But we also want to continue to grow for sure. We want to make sure that
our growth is measured in a way that does not jeopardize those that are producing and
do have those permits that are producing that $80 billion. So one of our primary directives
is to protect those that it currently exist. And part of that protection comes at just
being very measured in everything that we do from this point forward. Certainly the sensitivities
of that basin with the species, they're the four protective muscles, and the subject
of bi and potentially in past tri-state litigation causes us to move very measured.
And it's simply to protect those that are currently in the system and protect that
farm gate value.
Senator Sims, I will move on to Senator Watson.
His was blinking next.
Go ahead, Senator Watson.
Well, I just wanted to follow up where I left off and kind of ask.
I mean, what is the data I have to show to decide whether we need to stay in a
stay in a moratorium or let the moratorium or maybe let everybody become compliant
that's not compliant or you know something of that measure what is it where does it
got to be to make that decision and who makes that decision well well one of the things
that I mentioned earlier was flow benefit and that's something that is going to be
getting to Senator Eccles point you know what's the criteria in the future we're
looking at flow benefit so when you talk about putting extra straws in there or
of the straws that are in there, all of that will be in the context of what the flow
benefit of that system is and what those models do show. So, you know, so that's what I
would say, you know, that's what it needs to show is that whatever happens in the future
whether it's additional permits in this area or this pocket or wherever that is, that
it doesn't have an adverse impact on the flow benefit because in the event that that
happens it's going to open us up not just to internal potential farmer uncertainty in
the infrastructure and investments they've made because their neighbors are getting new
wells potentially impacted them but also our downstream neighbors that we have to consider
as well but flow benefit is something that we've you know currently holding as a high priority
is something we're looking at in terms of what what happens in the future well and I mean but
But again, for the ones that aren't in compliance, if we've been checking the data and the data
has not moved a whole lot and it's staying normal or within whatever this range is that
we're supposed to be measuring off of, why don't we just bring everybody in to compliance
and start collecting the data, the real data and get our acres matched up with what we're
supposed to be in and just bring everybody into the fold?
Well, you hit a good point earlier when you talked about the different, I guess, scenarios
that the past 20, 25 years that farmers have had to get water use permits have gone through
and that has changed over time. What you had to apply for or maybe the application looked
different or what you'd be required to do. But one thing that I've seen in the last 20 years is
it's not a blanket, it's not a blanket non-compliance issue as to put it in the terms that you talked
about. It's a case by case scenario almost every time. There are nuances to everybody who
is not in compliance. Some didn't know. Some knew. And there's a whole kinds of things,
but it's not something that can happen fast, and it takes a long time to work through
each of those cases. And one of the things we're doing right now is taking a step back
and working through each of those cases on one-on-one, more reaching out to those that like
you mentioned those that got the letters to help people understand what compliance
is, what it means, how to know what it is.
And in some cases, we're going to find some solutions to help people get into compliance.
There will be some that there, you know, that won't be easy choices to make by, you know,
the growers, the producers, or by EPD, for sure.
If you don't mind Senator Watson, I want to ask a question real quick.
And so where I live at in farm, you know, is from about east, so we don't have any water
problems over there.
In fact, we got too much water most of the time.
But my question is, you know, the aquifer that we're talking about, the farmers just
across the state line in Alabama and in Florida, they're still drilling wheels every day,
right?
And so I don't want you to think, I'm not trying to beat up on y'all, I just
sincerely would like to know. I mean, if we're pumping out the same
pollen, basically, and the farmers in Alabama and Florida are still able to
drill wells, but our farmers aren't, what do you say to that? That's one of
things that I mean if we were all on the same boat together and everybody all the
farmers weren't but I feel like the farmers and the other two states were pumping
out the pond and our our farmers aren't able to. Mr. Chairman I think what
separates us is two things number one we're upstream of Florida and that
matters in federal law your upstream has a has a federal obligation to protect
your downstream neighbor number one. Number two, we got those four federally endangered
muscles over in that Flint Basin, and they're not over there, you know, where the guys
are poking holes in Alabama or Florida that I know about. We do know about them in the
Flint Basin, but the fact that they're there draws a lot of attention, Mr. Chairman,
and it requires a lot of, you know, a lot of paying attention to on our part to make
sure that we're, you know, following the right protocol and move forward and talking
to the right people just to make sure that we preserve the infrastructure of those that
already have those permits in that area.
Senator Burns-Lightsman, he's been waiting patiently.
I'm patient, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Thank you for being here.
Appreciate the input.
Appreciate the work you did.
I want to come back to something maybe that Senator Watson keeps harping on and that's
not quite well.
How many are you in a little what area you're in but let's just let's just take what we've got about we got about 500
About 500 active cases
Mostly located in
The majority of those will be located in that river basin area
So that Southwest Georgia it is but not all of those we're talking about some of those are cases where you know
Maybe they're just not a meter on matter fat as a lot of those is just the meter where they're permitted
But the meter is not currently something like that
or maybe they hadn't turned in all the information.
There's a good load of those, too, but the hard ones,
Senator Burns, are the ones that your permits
were 100 acres and you're irrigating 200 acres,
and we don't have any extra acres to give,
or we're not taking applications to modify acres.
There's those, and then there's those that after 2012,
you've got those that did put in that we can see
by that imagery as Senator Watson mentioned,
even pumping forever, we can see that.
We can also see the ones that put it in, you know, in 2013 when they came in in 2012
and asked good to have it, and we said no, and they put that in anyway.
So we got those two, we got them, it's not, it's not one category, it's a broad category,
as well, you know, what I meant to get at is it just a case-by-case basis that ever happened
to go through things and they take a while.
And I appreciate that, but I would say to Senator Watson's point, we need to document
that is saying is effectively, so at least we have that data as a part of the utilization
data set. I want to shift over to East Georgia, South East Georgia, which is where I'm a
farm and I'm a pillar. I'm not a real farmer. I want you to know these guys are real farmers.
My grandfather was a farmer, but he had two mules, so it was a bit different about them.
But I have Burke County, which is one of the largest producing cotton peanut counties in the state,
In Scriven County, in Bullock County, and a host of others, a manual county, and down
the Savannah River, the Yogichi, the Ultima Hall, and we draw water from the Othlerian
aquifer.
And we poke holes down there, and we irrigate crops.
But we're also experiencing some significant growth from an industrial perspective and from
a residential perspective.
How does that fit into EBD-EPD's water management claim?
Well, with regard to agriculture,
EPD doesn't have the authority to consider a residential neighborhood whenever you apply
for an ag well.
So that's not something we do have.
We notice where some of those are and from a common sense perspective, we might take
a look and see how that's impacted, but that can't, you know, that's not necessarily
a factor in the decision to give you what you're asking for for ag purposes.
So my concern is long-time generational agricultural producers in South East Bullock County are likely
will be impacted by the industrial growth in that region.
How do we protect them?
How do we ensure that they can continue to farm and that the water supply will continue
to support their operation?
I'll try that one, I'll go back and talk to those guys.
I'm Rick Don, I'm the director of EPD.
I keep up here to talk to try to address some of Senator Watson's concerns, but particularly
on East Georgia, there's a little different concern on the coast and that deals with salt
water intrusion.
Salt water intrusion?
In the amount of groundwater pumping and I think the future of, you know, to accommodate
the growth in the future water use and the coastal region of Georgia is going to be more
use of surface water.
Surface water.
Yes, sir.
There's not a lake.
This is Savannah River, right?
The south of Augusta, Georgia, and that Savannah comes down and we've got two or three lakes
above.
So there's very limited surface water south east Georgia, right?
We've got a lot of ocean out there, but it's not only surface.
In particular, meaning particularly not so much the farming needs because again, the
is not a huge use out there, but the municipal industrial growth in that area.
And by the way, we certainly support that industrial growth and that residential road,
not only in my region, but also across our state, but it does impact our agricultural
industry substantially.
Absolutely, and again, the concern there is the groundwater pumping, what it does to the saltwater plume.
had his issues with saltwater intrusion related to pumping in Georgia so the
future there for for growth is going to be getting surface water towards
yes sir and as a mass vision I think that's a great idea I just need more
surface to fish correct they if y'all don't mind Senator I'm gonna Senator
Sam's light has been blinking for a while. Senator Sam's.
That's currently the only one that's under Niagara cultural moratorium. Yes, man.
I think one of the biggest differences in the way to answer that is the fact that municipal
industrial withdrawals put back about 80% of whatever they withdraw and agricultural withdrawals
are considered 100% consumptive.
Therefore, it's arguable, I don't know if we put 99% back,
or if we put 45% back, something may go back,
but the studies have not been done to show that.
So that's an area of some information gap.
Exactly what is the percentage that is put back into the system?
And until that's known, the models that are used
would use 100% talking with ag experts in the region of the flint though, and you're from
there too. You know the hottest times of the year, you know what it's like down there
and water is not available a lot of time. Surface water is not available a lot of time.
So the idea that agricultural water use is 100% consumptive, you know, in a lot of these
these ag experts minds is that it's pretty close, if I can say that.
Yeah, now it seems that the doctor has been doing veering the moratorium on what they
are there answers to this, that can help us create a more sustainable way of a lack of
reduction.
Absolutely.
The increase in something we work with is just increasing low pressure on the systems
that are out there, considering new technologies such as variable rate irrigation to turn water
are awful non-cropped areas, looking at certain drought conditions that allow use under certain
conditions, but CC irrigation under other conditions, that's another practice.
But in some cases, when you don't have anything, that might be better than nothing.
If you don't have a permit and you asked for a certain, let's say, rate or a certain amount
of acres, maybe we can't give you that, but we might give you something, it may not be
everything you ask for, but some of those practices might be that we, you know,
working with that individual is, hey, we can't give it to you. We can't give you
that 1,000 gallon per minute well here. It's the only way you can move it over
here because we think you could be all right here. And so just working with
people in placement as well as size and some of the design. And unfortunately, in
some of those cases, we're just in very sensitive areas with the muscles and
also in areas where the surface and groundwater is basically the same water.
is the same water. So just various types of conservation conditions that we could do potentially
seasonality uses of permitted water use or just things that we're looking at technology.
I want to point these to the water for next few years
that I was going to get some sense of that.
And I'm knowledgeable of some of the vinyl and other things.
But we have a few more photos that you did not plan to use.
It's actually some areas of the lower flantist
So, Senator Sims, if I could kind of combine this into some of the angles at what's in
was getting, when he was asking about the moratorium and we've been patiently waiting
for the moratorium and we're supposed to review every year and what do we do and things
like that.
I wanted to come up and just kind of emphasize the point, particularly for the last
five years where we've been very limited on what we can do with the moratorium due to
the tri-state water wars litigation.
We certainly didn't want to modify the moratorium while we were undergoing that litigation.
We litigation, that particular case has been largely resolved in our favor and of course
The first thing we ask is, in what ways can we responsibly modify the moratorium?
Are there areas, you clip talked about, you know, the groundwater surface water interaction
of their areas that are currently covered by the moratorium where, you know, additional
withdrawals mean I have such an impact on surface water flows.
And looking at that, again, the whole subarea for is kind of a blanket, no new groundwater
They're all from the Florida and aquifer, no new surface waters and again looking at
there's ways we can responsibly modify that at the edges to allow additional withdraws.
And we've looked at that very carefully and I think what we've decided as a policy
manager is to hold back on modifying the moratorium at this point to allow the exploration
of habitat conservation plans, incidental take permits, explore that process that that's
something we want to pursue. And if that's something we want to pursue, we want to
align those two processes together. So, Senator, I was trying to respond to some
of your questions about, you know, we're patiently waiting and that's kind of
where we are right now. Does that make sense? Okay. Yeah, that's a harder question. Right.
What difference does it make at this point and why don't we fill it out so that we have
this accurate information so that somebody tries to do something later on.
We have the accurate data and we're telling the truth.
Right now, we're not telling the truth.
We're telling them false information because we don't have all the data.
And you know, Cliff's sending letters and having to deal with them on an individual basis.
And I know there's instances where they can work some of it out, but there's some of them
and they just can't and it's not their fault.
They bought a piece of property that they didn't know.
They weren't told, you know,
and the Army of Farmers changed
and everybody's trying to be more efficient
and the equipment's more efficient.
And obviously we've been collecting the data just,
you know, and we get, we get the calls
with these people with these letters, you know,
from the farmers, from the oil drillers, from everybody,
and we have nothing to tell them.
They said, we're gonna wait on somebody one day,
maybe in their lifetime to reevaluate this
when that's what everybody said 11 years ago.
And I guess to go ahead, you clips, Mitch,
you didn't, you mentioned it.
Does Habitat Conservation Plan?
I don't know anything about it.
And I'm a farmer in Southwest Georgia,
and I've been a legislator for 10 years,
and I don't know anything about it.
You can't even find it.
You can't even Google it and find anything on it.
Cliff, you want to talk about the HCP,
and I think we've got some of our folks.
Yeah, love to learn about it.
I mean, it's and it's why are we waiting till now why didn't we go down this road right
after we went into the moratorium.
Hello, my name is Agna Trishjinskiem, the Chief of the Watershed Protection Branch and
I'll give you maybe a little bit of history about the Habitat Conservation Plan if that's
okay.
So this is a conversation that has actually started many years ago.
It's been bubbling off and on, and so there's been a lot more conversation about it.
Some points in time, a little bit less than others.
This is something that folks have been thinking about pretty much since the Fish and Wildlife
Service back in 1998 identified those four endangered mussels and one threatened mussel species,
but it really kicked off after EPD developed the Flint River Basin Plan.
This was the plan that Cliff mentioned, finalized in 2006.
One of the comments that we received from the Fish and Wildlife Service at that time was
that if we implemented the plan as written,
it would basically be considered,
or it could be considered a violation
of the Endangered Species Act.
Basically, we could be having an incidental taking.
This means that we would somehow harm
or in other ways negatively affect
one of those threatened and endangered species.
So when you're in that kind of situation,
you can either modify what you are doing
in a fairly significant way,
or you can work through a process
called an incidental take permit.
This is one of the components of the Endangered Species Act.
An incidental take permit says you could be doing
otherwise lawful activities that may result
in some taking of an endangered species,
but you're gonna also do whatever you can
to minimize or mitigate for that impact.
And the way that you describe how you minimize
and mitigate is through the development
of a habitat conservation plan that basically outlines
all of the strategy, all of the funding,
all of the folks are responsible.
And then you do some monitoring, fish and wildlife does some monitoring,
and they confirm, you know, are you really doing something beneficial for these species?
And the habit, so the Habitat Conservation Plan first kind of came on the radar
in that documented way back in 2006.
We received additional comments from fish and wildlife as we went
through the regional water planning process back in 2008.
We received letters back in 2010.
We received letters.
So this has been something that's been kind of simmering on the within our horizon,
I guess, for a while.
But these kinds of plans are challenging to make.
We have one successful one in Georgia
for the Red Cockated Woodpecker that is held by WRD,
Wildlife Resources Division.
There is also an attempt to have one up in the Kusa Basin
to help protect some of the starters that are up there.
But due to a lack of an established funding mechanism,
lack of ability to get all of the plan components together,
that actually fell apart.
So it takes years to develop these types of plans.
The Habitat Conservation Plan, there's nothing right now developed for it, but it is a component
of the ARPA project that Cliff described earlier, because as we're going through everything
and looking at what we've got, it looks like a viable option for us to develop an effective
permitting strategy that would address the concerns that you're mentioning.
So it would allow us to address liability, both for the farmers themselves as well as
for the state of Georgia.
If we were to open up permitting right now,
there's some concern, of course,
that we could be subject to litigation
or some other legal liability risk
that we are performing that taking.
It also allows us to build a more robust HTTP
to maintain that moratorium that might be secondary.
But another thing is that it does allow us
to bring in all of these tools, right?
Cliff was explaining the very complicated
series of decisions and series of tools
we have available to manage agricultural water withdrawal
permitting in the Flint River Basin.
And the HCP allows us to take all of that together, put it
under one big umbrella, and say, we're
not going to have this piecemeal approach.
We're going to have something comprehensive, something clear,
something that we have a lot of stakeholder buy-in for,
to really move this forward.
Because the farmers in that region
have been subject to a whole lot.
There were no permits until 1998.
Sorry, 1988.
Then in 1999, there was the first moratorium that
was put in place until 2006.
Then we issued permits in compliance
of the 2006 Flint River Basin Plan that lasted until the moratorium that was enacted in 2012.
So there's a lot of back and forth. We want to make sure that we have regulatory certainty.
We also want to be really sure and really clear about where we have capacity within our water
resources. Can I ask a question? So Senator Sims District, you have a farmer that owns land
and Quipman County, George, he can't drill a whale right across the border and you follow
that farmer can drill a whale, they're pumping the same water.
That's what I can't wrap my mind around.
I know that we're talking about downstream, but we're talking about east and west here.
This is it in North and South.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes, sir.
What do we say to these farmers?
because that's the one thing I would say,
and I want you all to understand
that especially these senators to the right of me
are under a tremendous amount of pressure
from their farmers down there.
And, you know, so, you know,
they, this is a big issue for them.
And so, do you understand where,
understand what you're saying about being downstream,
but this isn't downstream?
No, and I understand, I believe I understand the question.
And I think that you've hit on something that Director Dunn touched on and that, you
know, was what we're exploring because there are places, especially as you start moving
out to the fringe of sub-area four, where we see that the groundwater and the surface
water just isn't as closely connected.
So there are some places where if you put in another well, we're not going to see a lot
of effect on the surface water flows.
But we want to be able to really understand that hydrology and kind of put that all together
that we are establishing a very clear permitting process.
So we do think that there are areas, I don't know, I can't speak specifically to equipment,
but I know that there are areas within sub-area 4 where there may be some additional capacity
without necessarily hurting those muscles.
But that's something that we want to look at and evaluate with all of the tools that
are our disposal.
I know that's not necessarily a tomorrow answer, but we do recognize that there is that
variability.
Thank you.
Senator Watson.
So I've not heard about an HCP until recent.
So if we wouldn't have got the ARPA funds, we'd be talking about HCP.
And then on top of that, we just want a Supreme Court case.
And now we're basically going to say that farmers are taking a species,
they're admitting to taking a species after we just told the whole world
We're not doing anything wrong.
I just don't understand that concept.
Yeah, and I think one thing to clear fun,
I apologize by Ms. Spoker, was not particularly clear
with the incidental take permit.
You're not necessarily admitting to a taking.
What you are doing is you're protecting yourself
in case someone were to make that allegation
or in case they're happened to be a taking.
So that it's more of a protective thing
than it is an admission of any sort of guilt
or anything like that.
And I'm so sorry, I forgot the very first part of the company.
The money, yes sir.
We're all the sudden got some money, so now we're talking HCP,
and we're whatever that is, and we're moving forward with it,
and we don't even know how long that take.
How long does it take?
So are we talking another two years,
another five years before we can even answer these farmers?
Absolutely, so, and if I forget one of the questions,
please remind me, but the money was a big part
because those deeper wells are going
be very helpful in terms of protecting flows and creating additional, yeah, basically
creating additional flow being really protective of the muscles.
That was a big thing, and that helped move things along much more quickly, but that conversation
about the HCP was something that had been generally discussed for longer than that.
So I don't know that the ARPA funds necessarily resulted in a change in process, but the ARPA
funds I think certainly made available more options and on a quicker time frame, because
your second point, we don't want folks waiting another decade before they can do anything.
I understand that there are real challenges that are faced by constituents in both of
the districts and so we want to be responsive. The big thing is we want to move quickly
but we don't want to hurry, we don't want to mess this up. So typically the development
of an HCP can take anywhere from about 18 months to, I would say, 24 months, 27 or so.
We would be looking at having submitted something to you as fish and wildlife as that is, you
know, sort of the direction that we go.
In that general timeframe, fish and wildlife tends to take six to 18 months to approve.
There are ongoing discussions to see, is there anything in this process that we can speed
up?
Is there something that we can do concurrent with fish and wildlife review or things we
can do on the front end?
Because we certainly understand that there is a level of urgency there.
So why is this not, is this not have to be in statute or passed to the legislature?
The incidental vehicle?
The general concept of HCP and making that decision for the farmers of the state of Georgia.
That was not the process that was completed with the 2000 HCP for the Red Cockade Woodpecker.
So my interesting is that that is not the standard process.
We do understand that this affects a lot of stakeholders and that is why this is a very
stakeholder driven process with a lot of conversations, a lot of folks at the table because EPD would
not be in the best position to make decisions for farmers, we are in a good position to make
decisions with farmers.
I didn't know about it.
Senator Samson, did you have?
Oh, hold on.
Sam, Sam, hold on just a minute.
I'm sorry.
No, I got to send it to Watson.
You go ahead.
the compliance. What was, we've been collecting the data. We know what it is. They're pumping.
They're going to keep pumping. Why can't we at least bring everybody into compliance?
Yeah, it's, it's, it's an extremely hard issue. You know, I don't want to set up a regime
where the best way for you to be able to irrigate your field is just to go out and do it.
and then EPD will excuse and bring it in.
So we had to find a way, I think, responsibly,
in a way that works.
And again, as Cliff mentioned, a lot of this
is on the ground, are there other permits
that we can, that you may possess, that we can modify,
maybe take some acres off over here to allow things like that?
It's just a very tough issue.
Just to say, that's okay, everyone, come on in.
Senator Watson,
Judd Turner is in the audience.
Mr. Turner, would you mind
I understand you were the director when the moratorium was issued.
Would you mind coming forward or do you have anything that you would like to share?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir, it's been a good discussion and I appreciate Senator Watts and your questions
and yours, Mr. Chairman.
We give, I'll just say a couple of things about how we, where we were when I was director,
which I took that job on January 1, 2012, and we did this moratorium again in the summer,
and it was the second year of what would be a historic drought for Southwest Georgia.
I mean, we talk about 1954 as the drought of record for one year, but if you look at
the back-to-back nature of 11 and 12, we consider that the drought of record.
I was, I'm from Albany originally and have family over in Arlington and in in in Calhoun County
and I know my dad was driving down Highway 62 and called me in that office over there and
said, Hey, I just drove over itchway notchway Creek and I've never seen it that low and
I went down the hall and talked to one of our guys and said, Hey, what's the gauge at
Millford show?
This is the winner, right?
it in the summer and it was four CFS flow. And the drought of record 1954 before we had
a lot of irrigation, it was 120 CFS. Now we're in the middle of litigation with Florida,
but I want to make this point really clear, if George's, and this gets to your question
Mr. Chairman, if Georgia's state lines went all the way to the Mississippi River and all
the way to Gulf of Mexico, we should still be doing a habitat conservation plan and
we should have still said time out on new wells to get our hands around this because
the four CFS at Milford should scare, I understand there are federal muscles at issue, but that
That should be a challenge and a problem for all active farms in the region.
That's not a secure source of water, and we got a lot of surface water irrigation guys.
And so that's how it started.
And yes, it's taken a long time, and I don't have all the metrics about how to get there.
I do think this, though, about the Habitat Conservation Plan, Senator.
We did do two versions of a planning grant from Fish and Wildlife for Habitat Conservation
Planning in about 2012 and 2013 where we were looking at feasibility and a lot of the
other things were going on and we were coming out of the drought and we got some good muscle
data during that point and so we were thinking about that.
And it's easy to go on Fish and Wildlife's website and sort of look at a Habitat Conservation
plan in a vacuum and think well wait a minute how does this work with what we're trying
to do and how would the moratorium work but I see it and in full disclosure I'm working
with the water center on this project really my role is if we get around to a habitat conservation
plan we put something together and we're going to present it to fish and wildlife that's
going to be a lot of the work I do but um center you ask about well wait a minute when
And at what point do we cross a line where this body should be way and in a water policy?
I mean, my answer to that is it kind of depends on what's in the plan.
There are habitat conservation plans that are quite small that are approved by Fish and
Wildlife where two landowners get together at a very, at just two of them and decide to
do something voluntary and it helps a critter population and Fish and Wildlife approves
it.
You know, that's not what we're talking about here.
What we think we have the potential to do here.
And again, what the federal money did with ARPA
is it let the state do something.
We've been talking about no and we needed to do
back to Cliff's point about stream flow benefits
or flow benefits.
We've kind of known one of the best things we could do
is do this source switching during a drought
drought from the surface water to groundwater.
And so, to defend EPD for a second, the ability to adjust the moratorium, not just in a
very limited way based on the data we have now, but in a much more comprehensive way when
we consider not just can we afford to put two more straws in this acreage right here.
But if we're moving these guys down, getting that benefit from stream flow, if we're looking
And these other management practices, if we're revitalizing the Flint River Drought Protection
Act so it works and folks can voluntarily suspend irrigation during droughts in the auction
function and is working when all of that's in a plan and I can't tell you, there's no
plan in the drawer or anybody's hiding.
You've got to go through the stakeholder process that Anya just talked about.
But in that process, if that, there could be ten different plans we could all have on
the table.
And they all aren't equal.
I mean, some of them are going to cost more, some of them are going to have more benefit
in the river.
But for the folks who have been working on this for a long time, and really the way the
Habitat Conservation Plan got re-kicked off, because we've talked about it all these years,
but the lady, I'll put President McCall on the spot when he was Chairman McCall and
Chairman Wilkinson in the Senate they in 2017 so we're in the middle of the
litigate into the litigation where they had a joint ag committee meeting in
Perry and all the directors but one were invited and we all talked about this
issue we had this conversation in 2017 and the takeaway was we really ought to
get back on this HCP because it's the vehicle to look at all this stuff so
that when we open back up to the extent we can, we know we can't just say remember 4CFS in 2012.
If we have another 2012, 4CFS at Milford, that's what's going to happen without adding new irrigation.
So the problem is how do we get to add some new but also protect the sustainability of what we got
and protect these critters because they present a risk. So back to the point about what's
Alabama and Florida doing, if their critters get in the way they could have trouble, but
right now they don't have that problem that we have.
So that's why we got to kind of do this if we're smart.
At the same time, if we do it under the umbrella of this HCP, open stakeholder process is going
to take us a while to model all this stuff, but the bricks are laying around in the yard.
We got more data for an HCP than probably any state in the country.
So I'm real bullish that this is going to work, but if there's something that changes that
needs to be implemented that requires a change in law or policy, it would require coming
back here.
So it kind of depends, answer your questions or kind of depends.
But I know this HCP cannot be fully understood.
And when I was director, I, EPD was, you know, WRD had that planning grant in 2012,
so my cousins inside the DNR family really were the grant recipients, and EPD was
precip, you know, participating as the regulatory authority for AG.
But now we've got, because of the RPR grant, we just have this opportunity, but to answer
your question, if we didn't have the RPR money, there'd be several of us still saying based
on 2017. This is this is what we need to do. And I think Farm Bureau who've been
real educated on this and these guys can I don't want to speak for them but I'll
tee it up. I mean they have a policy that really has looked at this and said it
within the moratorium we ought to we ought to look at the moratorium adjustment
we ought to do it inside an HCP. And Mr. President I don't want to speak for you
but I think that's accurate on the way you're.
I don't want to see another one.
Yes, sir.
So, Mr. Chairman, thanks for the recognition,
but I've blathered on, but any questions or anything,
I'm happy to try to answer.
Any member of the committee on this?
Senator Watson?
So if it's such a great plan, why were we not asking
for the money earlier?
We kind of did not from the state money
because we did have, we just took the time to,
I mean, the tri-state litigation
was, calls us to pause a lot of work.
But we immediately were trying to work on
a habitat conservation planning
through the Fish and Wildlife starting last year,
the minute that we could.
And then the ARPA money was there
and that was really a governor's office conversation
that kind of came along.
So why is there not more education about this subject home?
Y'all's Water Policy website or EPD's website?
I think that is it.
Your other website or somebody's website?
Well, I think where people can be.
Yes, sir.
I understand what's going on.
I think that is a great takeaway.
I mean, I think I won't speak for EPD,
but on the Water Policy side, the Georgia Fit website
really talks more about the art of funding to move folks down.
And I think we need to move up some of the ACP.
I think that needs to happen.
EPD can talk about it.
Talk about it.
You get something up there.
Senator.
And then Farm Bureau, I do think you guys have got a fair bit of material on HCP.
I mean, it may not be front page of your site, but we all can, I think, take that advice
that we really need to elevate that publicly available information, for sure.
Any other questions from members of the committee, I know that I was getting late thank you all for coming today.
Thank you for taking time to talk with us.
I've certainly learned a lot, had a lot of discussion.
I will say this though, and obviously, you know, I'm a farmer and not a water specialist, but a geologist.
But I would say this, the way things stand today, I would
sure hate to know that my granddaddy bought his farm in
equipment county, Georgia, and instead of buying it right
across the line, and you follow Alabama in terms of
property values and what it means for being able to
utilize the resources under the ground.
That's one of the things that I, having a hard time
wrapping my brain around, but I do appreciate what
what you do and I appreciate that I certainly don't understand what all you do.
But I do think that to Senator Watson's point, I think it would be very helpful to them
and they're a job that they do in representing their constituency to get some more information
out of these folks so that they can see that maybe y'all are going to land this plane
at some point, honestly, because I can tell you, I don't even represent their district
but just as serving as a chairman of this committee
and being a farmer myself, the amount of text
and phone calls that you get from folks in that part
of the world, and I'm sure you all deal
with that, you're sales.
But a popular guy down there.
So we do appreciate it.
I know we've taken an hour and 15 minutes of your time.
Thank you for coming in.
We appreciate it.
And wait a minute, we have, we have all Jasper.
Go ahead, Senator Hatchett.
This is the first time I've had a former law professor testify
in front of a committee that I'm on.
He taught me water law at UGA.
Yeah, we should talk more about this, shouldn't we?
Well, I will tell you, I am not an attorney,
but I did watch a lot of Matt lot when I was growing up.
But thank y'all for being here.
I appreciate your time with that.
This meeting is adjourned.
