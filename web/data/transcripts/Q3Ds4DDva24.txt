TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right, if y'all can start finding
your way to a seat, please.
Well, who are you?
Okay, guys. We're going to try to get
back on schedule.
>> We know you're excited to see your
friends.
Hope you enjoyed lunch. Thank you for
being back quickly. Let's get back on
schedule. Superintendent Woods
is our next presenter. He's already got
the podium.
The mic is on. Superintendent, the the
floor is yours. All right. Ready to go.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, again to all
the members of the joint uh budget
committee, it's a pleasure to be with
you today. Um, as we begin
from my house in Tiffan, Georgia, it
roughly takes me 12 and a half hours to
reach a place called success. And that's
a place called success Missouri.
As I meet today with you, I want to
state that all of our 1.7 million
students can reach a place also called
success. Today I will share with you a
few updates on the progress made on that
journey. But more importantly, I will
share the steps that we need to ensure
that every student arrives at a
destination called success.
This journey has been one that we have
taken together since I took office in
2015.
And I want to personally thank each of
you for investing in public education.
Thank you for providing support for
school safety, mental health, poverty
funding, afterchool and summer learning,
literacy, teacher raises, and much, much
more.
But what are investments without
positive returns?
Because of your investments, we have
seen tangible positive outcomes for
Georgia students. We have positioned our
students to not only arrive at success,
but to experience success.
For the eighth year in a row, Georgia's
public school students significantly
outperform their national counterparts
on the SAT.
Georgia's class of 2025 scored 33 points
higher on higher than the national
average for public school students. In
doing so, they beat the reading and ro
and and writing national average by 18
points and the math national average by
14 points. For the ninth year in a row,
Georgia students beat the national
average on the ACT, outperforming the N
national average in reading, English,
and science.
We continue to see improvement in
Georgia's high school graduation rate.
Last year, we experienced an all-time
high graduation rate of 87.2%
across the state.
The rise of our state's graduation rate,
I I believe, can be correlated to our
move from insisting that students must
attend a 4-year university.
By investing in both career tech and
work-based learning education
opportunities and expanding the
graduation diploma options, we achieved
a 98.45%
grad rate for our career pathway
completers.
Relevance, practicality, and the pursuit
of one's passion are necessary to reach
success.
That's why I'm calling for support or
continued support to outfit CTA Labs for
high demand career programs. This is a
crucial element of our statewide efforts
to ensure that Georgia is the top state
for talent.
Remember, we are preparing our students
for their future, not our past.
After replacing Common Core Math with
our new math standards, we've seen two
consecutive years of extremely strong
mathematic increases in our ma in our
math milestone scores. In fact, several
grades have already recovered to
prepandemic levels.
This year, we will eliminate Common Core
reading in the state of Georgia as we
roll out our new literacy standards and
a renewed emphasis on cursive writing.
Regarding literacy,
I am in strong agreement with Speaker
Burns proposal to place a literacy coach
in every Georgia elementary school. We
have seen this model work in Mississippi
and in other states to achieve
substantial reading improvement.
This model is also working in Georgia.
Currently, we have placed a school level
coach in all of our lowest performing
elementary schools in the state, and the
results have been incredibly clear.
We saw a 15% improvement in reading
outcomes in one year based on universal
screener results. Some schools in
Georgia on the Georgia milestones had
grade level reading increases as high as
29%
points.
This model is only being used, however,
in the lowest performing elementary
schools. These coaches are only being
funded with federal school improvement
dollars. Both limit the ability to reach
all students and prevent them from
having the opportunity to reach and
experience success.
School safety remains a fundamental
keystone of our priorities this year.
With both the with the support of both
Governor Kemp and you, a line item for
safety and security funding has been
provided to make our schools safer.
Moving forward, we're calling on you to
maintain that light item line item for
safety funding.
On the issue of distraction-free
legislation,
I'm asking you to expand the K12 cell
phone limitation to grades 912.
This is a recommendation that mirrors
that offered by the stud by the Senate
study committee on social media and AI
led by Senator Harrell. It is a priority
of Speaker Burns as well.
This is both an academic and mental
health issue. Studies show the negative
academic impact and emotional strain
placed on exa excessive cell phone
screen time usage. Both my student
advisory and teacher advisory councils
consistently rank mental health
struggles as the number one issue faced
by students. In addition to the above,
it is our duty to model appropriate
usage of electronic devices.
Teachers and staff must set the example.
Schools must focus on reunification
processes with parents for any unseen
situation.
With that being said, this year on my
student advisory committee,
I have a young student that was shot at
Appalache High School.
in listening to the student.
I do believe that we can protect
academic integrity
of the classroom and address concerns by
both students and parents.
But I do believe this process should be
answered by our local districts.
I know that you share our concerns over
financial crisis in Dublin City. For
several months, the department has been
working with members of the general
assembly, many who are in this room
today, to determine the best course of
action to prevent such an occurrence
from happening again.
You can view a few li a full list of our
proposals by scanning the QR code.
to our school districts. There is no
intent to create an overburdensome and
overly compl compliant process that will
unnecessarily impact
all due to the inter irresponsibility of
a few.
It is simply about ensuring that
students, teachers, staff and families
do not bear the cost of financial
mismanagement.
If every student is to achieve success,
then they must have the correct vehicle
to take them there. And that of course
is our teachers. To recruit and retain
these individuals, we must invest in
them and their careers.
I want to thank Governor Kemp for
including a 2001 time supplement for
educators in his budget proposal.
This is a very appreciative first step.
To continue this step of progress, I'm
asking for the following. A $10,000
salary raise increase over the next five
years. An expansion of the 21-year
teacher salary cap. A call for all
teachers to receive a duty-free lunch
unless they receive extra compensation.
A guaranteed five personal days for
teachers and classified staff.
support for a statewide expansion of the
Georgia Department of Education's
teacher apprenticeship program along
with Georgia Best, a program offering
free advanced degrees to eligible
teachers.
And we are advocating
continuing the return to work
legislation that helps fill teacher
vacancies. That legislation will sunset
this year if no action is taken.
These recommendations
are not solely aspirations on my part,
but they fully align with the
recommendations that have come out of SR
237.
Both Governor Kemp and you have taken
historic action to invest in Georgia's
teachers over the past eight years.
I am very grateful for the steps you
have taken, but I am also very hopeful
that we will see the momentum continue
in the years to come.
I encourage you to review the full set
of the 2026 legislative priorities from
the agency. You can access them using
the QR code on the screen.
But ultimately behind every policy
proposal
are students, educators, and families
whose lives are shaped by the choices we
make.
Students will be arriving at school
seeking the opportunity to arrive and
experience success.
We will either derail that process
or we will set up guard rails that will
set that will assure a safe arrival.
I'm asking all of us to come together
and make success a reality for 1.7
million children in the state of
Georgia. At this time, I'll turn this
over to Russ Rome and he'll go over the
QB budget. Russ.
Thank you, Superintendent Woods. Thank
you, Chairman Tiller, Chairman Hatchet,
members of the General Assembly.
I appreciate the opportunity to present
the governor's recommended uh FY26
amended budget and the FY27 budget.
Start off Whoops. There we go. Start
off. I want to uh kind of talk about
some of the items that have been put
into our budget and kind of give you an
idea of where we're at with those. Um we
we do plan on providing a much more
indepth analysis once the school year is
over and we can we can start to gather
where some of these districts have spent
these funds. Um but first off in the
student support services you we we got
$19.58
million for mental health grants. Uh
this included 968 schools, 938,864
students. Uh this was $20,000 for every
middle and high school. Uh the
department provided guidance to systems
on the allowable use of funds that
included contracts with local mental
health agencies, contracts with
telemental health providers, contracts
with individual mental health
professionals, and to purchase
curriculum and intervention materials.
We had uh a little over 15 million in
our economically disadvantaged for
students grants. Uh this reached 70
school systems and 94,180
students uh for at risk student
interventions. uh to also extend
learning opportunities after school or
summer during the summer after school or
during the summer. Uh access to advanced
coursework such as AP, access to
opportunity funding such as STEM, arts,
and music and targeted teacher training.
We also had a little about 2.3 2.4
million for social worker grants. This
served 114 school systems which
qualified for this grant. uh this
basically funded uh systems that didn't
have enough funds to provide a school
social worker. So any district that had
less than 2475 FTEES was prrated in
amount so that each district should now
with these funds have a school social
worker. We also received 12,500,000 for
out of school grants uh which allowed us
to fund 60 community grantees with
awards between 25,000 and 300,000. These
grant allocations were awarded by the
state board of education in September of
2025 and are in the district's hands.
We also have a little over almost $ 109
million, which we're very appreciative
in school safety and security grants,
which is 47,125
per school to 2311 schools.
Um this these expenses for these include
salaries, benefits, training for
post-certified law enforcement, cameras,
alert systems, door controls, fencing,
gates, and security vestibles.
We also got just under $7 million for
student advocacy support specialists.
This system level position is to
coordinate efforts by the local school
system to provide appropriate
intervention for students with or at
risk for mental health services. Uh this
dollar amount represents one half of the
funding outlined in House Bill 268 of
the 2025 session. Um and it is half the
funds because due to the job description
deadline which was December 31st of
2025, we reached this deadline. We have
provided the job description to the
districts and we have alerted them that
it's now available for reimbursement.
All right. Next up, I want to talk about
the state's largest expenditure QBE. And
in order to talk about that, I have to
talk about the largest cost driving
factor, which is our full-time
equivalent student or FTE. These are
obtained each uh March and October in
student counts provided by the
districts. These counts record the
actual class the students are attending
for six segments of the school day.
There are 18 different QB programs and
QB is weighted uh funding formula based
on cost differentials of each one of
these programs.
This next slide just shows the the FTE
collection process. I won't go through
all that.
This next slide is our FTEEs from FY19
to amended 26. When I first saw the
numbers, I they kind of jumped out at
me, too. As you you'll note in 2026
calculation, uh there is a reduction of
FTEEs of just over 34,000 or 1.95%.
The state has not seen a reduction in
FTEEs at this high since COVID in 2021.
As you can see, when we had an FTE
reduction of just over 36,000 students,
what we what we noticed is based by
program is that most of these FTE
reductions were in the three uh general
school whether elementary, middle, and
high school. We did see some increases
in some of the higher cost area, but
overall it was an FTE decline and it was
across districts. It wasn't we we
researched, we checked to make sure it
didn't pinpoint certain districts to
kind of find out this is an across
district FTE decline
systems indicated when we reached out to
them to find out as you can imagine with
34,000. We wanted to make sure the
number was right before we came to you
guys. Um what indicate indicated the
declining enrollment? There was not one
specific item as actually several uh
continued birth rate declines impacting
kindergarten class sizes. Uh aging
counting population uh including empty
nest households not moving out due to
the housing market uh increased private
and homeschool attendance.
I included this next slide to kind of
give you an idea as one of the key
factors with the kindergarten outpac uh
the 12th graders exiting outpacing the
kindergarteners entering. As you can see
in 2011,
we had a lot more kindergarters coming
in than we had 12th graders graduating.
And that has slowly declined all the way
to the FY 26. As you can see, there's a
pretty good differential now in students
leaving versus the kindergarteners
coming in.
All right. Now, I want to talk about
some of the uh highlights in the amended
FY26 and 27 budget. Um,
first off, we got 300 just under 367.7
million in our amended fiscal year
budget. As the superintendent mentioned,
this is for a $2,000 one-time salary
supplement. Uh this supplement funding
does include FICA and it is the same
methodology as the supplement that we uh
got in amended fiscal year 2024 and it
does include classroom teachers, central
and school administrative positions,
nonQB teachers and staff, lunchroom
workers, custodians, bus drivers.
We're also very appreciative that QB has
been fully funded out of seven of the
last eight years.
There's funding in there for 270 new
school buses and just over 38.5 million
in pupil transportation operational
funding which keeps that percentage
around the 40% that was established in
prior years.
We got an additional 750,000 in high
demand career equipment grants for a
total appropriation now of $2 million.
the CTA program. When this funding came
in, the original 1.25 million, we
received 199 applications, including
about 20.4 million. We awarded 17 awards
for 1,250. This 750,000 will assist us
in awarding some more applications. The
common uses for these funds were
industry grade equipment and labs,
software and technology, credentiings
and certifi credentiing and
certification, workbased learning
expansion and recruitment and student
engagement.
In our amended fiscal year 26 budget, we
also received 750,000 for mental health
services reimbursement maximization
project.
And as I mentioned earlier, the 109 just
under 109 million in continued support
for school security.
All right, up next I'll mention a couple
of the F amended FY26 budget
recommendations. As you can see in the
midterm adjustment for growth of just
over 43 million. Uh this is due to, as I
mentioned in that FTE slide, a lot of
while there was a decline in the
elementary, middle, and high school,
there was some increases in some of the
higher cost areas. And as most of you
know, with the amended budget, districts
are held harmless for the FTE decline.
That's why there's a $43 million
increase. Um there's a little over 14
million for this special needs
scholarship fund. This is a uh projected
amount based on the first two quarter
payments. We make these payments
quarterly and then project it out. And
we'll need an additional 14.4 million to
finish out the year and provide those
scholarships. And then I'll uh mention
the uh social worker grant the 1.3 as I
mentioned earlier. Uh this grant is the
additional funds needed in order to
ensure that we keep funding one social
worker in each district.
In our FY27,
I'll mention a few of these
recommendations.
Um the enrollment growth and training
and experience of just over 9.2 million.
Um in years past uh with a relatively
fat flat uh FTE count we would have
probably been standing up here asking
for you know two 300 million. So that is
significantly lower due to the FTE
decline. Uh the special needs
scholarship another 14.4 a little over
14.4 million. We're very appreciative of
the governor putting this in the base.
Uh this amount
uh has not been adjusted in several
years. So this will significantly reduce
the amount we have to come back and ask
for in the midterm. And then the state
health uh benefit plan per member per
month um just under 200 million that is
to increase the per member per month
from 1885 to 2028 per person effective
71 2026
the I won't go through this slide most
of these items that are other
significant are 27 or were in the
presentation earlier
and the last item that I have on here is
the U for the amended and the FY27 seven
budgets. We are going to be asking for
an additional amount of 1.4 million for
the AP and the PSAT tests. Uh we were
given 750,000 in FY26 for increased AP
and PSAT exams which gave us about 5.67
million. We did receive the invoice for
PSAT which is 1.42 million, a little
less than what we had in the budget for
the PSAT. However, we're projecting an
increase to 5.62 62 million for AP
exams. So with the savings of the PSAT
and the uh with the additional expense
on the AP exam, we need another 1.4
million in order to provide um the
districts with one AP exam for all STEM
students and for free and reduced lunch.
That's all I have. Thank you.
>> Thank you all. All right. I want to
remind everybody, we're really glad
there's so many people here, so many
members of the committee and others that
aren't members of the committee. And I
just want to remind you that today,
because we're running behind and a lot
of questions, we're only taking question
from members of the committee. That
could change tomorrow and Thursday
because sometimes
the non-members may be the only ones
here. Um, so that being said,
uh, Representative Ballard
Okay. Um, thank you, Superintendent. Um,
this fall at a conference, um, you said
that you'd heard a lot of noise about
third grade reading, but we had a
reading proficiency rate of 65%.
Yet, I'm looking at the milestones
dashboard and it said proficient 20 for
third grade. proficient 24%
distinguished 11%. So that's 35%.
So what are the discrep what's the
discrepancy in those numbers?
>> I would have to I mean the numbers I've
looked at again is specific your reading
some of the information again I have to
look at the dashboard you know really is
a combination of of ELA scores as a
composite score. So that may be what
what's being referenced. Uh again
according to Dr. for Timberlake. The
information that that I've been
presented with, the proficiency rate for
third grade, just looking at reading,
you know, should be around 65%.
>> Okay. Well, maybe you want to look at
your dashboard because it doesn't say
that.
>> Okay,
>> Chairman Higgman.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.
Superintendent.
This is not a direct budget question. I
think we can't let this meeting go by
without go without talking about the
Dublin city school system.
>> Sure.
>> And the travesty that's happened there
and the back behind and the fact that
they there they were 14 months behind in
state health plan benefit payments. I
know we've had some great discussion on
that. Would you kind of bring the bring
the group up to get up to date on what's
happened with Dublin city schools and
and then also what is the projected
downfall or shortfall for June 30th this
year for them.
>> Okay. Rusk, I'll let you kind of address
Dublin City.
>> Yeah, thank you, sir. Um, yeah, I don't
want to mess up my dates, but I want to
say it was back in August, we were
alerted around that time frame of a
significant deficiency in the Dublin
City School System, uh, specifically
around their state health benefit plan.
Um, I believe they owed around 7.4 4
million which was a combination of both
uh employee and employer contributions
for uh since the beginning of 25 and
into to FY 2026
before we made our first meeting they
did catch up all their employee
deductions
um which has caused so they were now at
around 6.5 6.6 six million in state
health benefit plan. When we first went
out to the district, we were projecting
and started looking at their books, we
were projecting close to a 10 10.3
million, I think was the original um
deficit
and some significant staffing issues. Um
we've been working with the district.
We've got, I believe,
There you go. You got it.
>> Mark, we got doctor on the way. And
we've got uh
back to your seats. Obviously,
we're blessed in the general assembly to
have quite a few medical professionals.
And so
the medical emergency you just witnessed
was obviously attended to by three
physicians within a less than a minute
for
thank you for your courtesy and allowing
us to to take the obviously necessary
break. But um as you know the general
assembly is is blessed to have many
medical professionals in our midst and
and those of you who witnessed this just
now realize that there were four medical
doctors around the individual within
less than a minute. So we are blessed uh
to have a citizen legislature who has a
lot of expertise and I'm really thankful
for those medical professionals who were
here.
Just take a brief moment of silence.
Thank you all.
Commissioner Woods was um and Mr. Russ,
sorry for the interruption.
Um I honestly don't remember if we were
asking a question or you were answering
a question.
>> City Dublin city question. So I was kind
of giving a brief.
>> That's a good one to fall out on.
Can we say next question? No, that's all
right. Just
>> um Okay, as I was saying, I think um
they had about 6.6 6 million in SHBP
which uh sparked us to get in there and
as as we got started to uncover we
uncovered a lot worse. It was anywhere
from 10 to 12 million in a de a cash
deficit. Um they were also behind in
several audits. Um we have employed five
team members from the department of
education and they've been there ever
since to assist with uh with these.
We've had numerous meetings with the
legislature to kind of keep everybody
involved. And what what uh we've been
working through with our the
superintendent's goal, you know, was to
make sure that students finished the
school year and the teachers got paid.
Um, with that being said, um, we did
work very hard next to the the current
Dublin city, uh,
and with the current Dublin city staff
to, uh, help them identify areas that
could be reduced to try to reduce this
this uh, significant deficit. Um, we uh,
they renegotiated their repayment plan
of the $6.5 million. So, they start in
February, actually next month, on a
24-month repayment plan of the employer
portion that they owe for FY25. They
have been current on their FY26
uh state health benefit plan reductions.
Um they instituted numerous cuts, as I
said, um some extremely necessary, some
kind of harder to swallow. But um with
all that being said, they should finish
the uh current fiscal year with about a
$2.3 million surplus. Now, that number
changes monthto monthth as we provide
additional documentation. Now, when I
say they're $2.3 million surplus, we I
always preface that by saying they're
going to need those funds to operate
next year as well. So, they they um one
of the items we did advance QB funding
to them. So, they still have one more
month of QB funding, but it should
coincide with their property tax
revenues coming in. So,
>> is there any other specifics?
>> There's He's got a couple other
questions and we're going to try to
>> that I'll sorry Senator H. I think what
he was asking you was u we know this
happened at one system, there's 181
others. Do we expect this will happen
anywhere else?
>> We do. We have received the
reconciliations from the state health
benefit plan. Um we have reviewed all
outstanding balances. There were a
couple of districts that um did have
some significant uh deficiencies.
However, none none of them were even in
the realm of the Dublin city one. The uh
one of the other districts, I won't
mention by name, but they already had a
repayment plan which actually should be
completed this March. Um the other
district it was a
uh they had sent the payments but they
weren't cash. So we're we're working
with the state health benefit plan to
clear up those reconciliations. I do
also know that in meetings with I think
the superintendent has released some
financial priorities earlier in the
slide that could also address that we're
suggesting to help you know mitigate
situations like this in the future.
>> Representative Hugley.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you all
for the presentation. Um
each time that we do something for
employees, our local school districts
come back to us because not all of their
employees are covered by what we do. So
who are we leaving out with this $2,000?
Uh so I'll know what I'm going to hear
when I go home.
I believe we just got the documents from
the governor's office to who and we're
kind of sifting through them, but as I
stated on that the other slide, it
appears everybody that you know I do
think there was some folks that might
have been left off back in the 24 that
we learned from and that we've tried to
pick up. So
not specific, you have a specific area,
I could answer that, but
>> So let me just ask you then. Are
custodians included on here? I see
nurses, nutritional workers, bus
drivers. Are custodians included on
here?
>> Okay.
>> Uh the on the AP exams, how many are we
allowing for?
>> I'm sorry.
>> Your AP exams, how many are we allowing
our students to take?
>> So, it's one free AP exam for all free
and reduced lunch students and then one
uh free STEM class for all students. And
superintendent mentioned uh contracted
employees would not be considered.
>> Contract employees are not. Okay.
>> Uh one last thing. Um you
talked about the number of private
schools students have increased and
homeschool students have increased. Can
you send us those numbers?
>> Yes, ma'am. We can do that.
>> Thank you very much,
>> Senator Burns.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you,
Superintendent. appreciate your work. My
question relates to virtual education
secondary level. Can you tell me how
many virtual students we have in grades
K through three and do you feel that
virtual education is appropriate at that
grade level?
>> At that time we'd I'd have to get the
information. I don't have that on
Russia. You have we'd have to document
that. I know depending which areas. I
mean we have a very large um charter
virtual school that's out there. So we'd
have to see if we could document those
numbers and plus the numbers we have. So
we'll get those to you. U I think
virtual again is it for everyone? No,
it's not. And I think you have to kind
of look at what are what are the um u
results that we are seeing. Uh for some
of those we could see the milestones
testing. So again we do have some
documentation that we can rely on that.
Uh but it's a it's an individual call.
It's onetoone with that. But uh really
it ultimately comes down what type
program is being offered because all
virtual programs are not equal.
>> Chairman Irwin,
>> thank you chairman. Um first of all, Mr.
Superintendent, thank you for work with
our students and uh our our future I
will tell you with those students. Um I
want to step back for a minute. I'm in
agreement with the leadership degree
overhaul that that we need and that and
looking at the tiered system that we
have by which they attain that
leadership. Um have you done any look at
your recommendation on the compensation
about how much that would be so that I
can figure some return on our
investment?
Do we have any on that on the staff
increase?
>> How many uh
current
leaders that have degrees
>> that are not getting compensated?
So, what would that cost us when we
start compensating them and they're not
a leader yet?
>> Again, we might have to check with
PSC or Brett, see if we can get that
information off hand. Uh because again
to say how many individuals who
currently have a degree this is what
you're talking about but are not
probably in leadership and getting paid
for leadership. Would that
>> is that correct?
>> About a thou okay Mr. Rome says about a
thousand educators.
>> See that also indicates that we're going
to have a shortage somewhere down the
line because we just don't have enough
that have that certification to be able
to step into it.
>> You you're correct. What's that?
>> Uh let's see. Let's see. Go ahead. share
with you
>> and the cost is just under $8 million.
>> Okay.
>> But to to your point about the you know
the the deficit of of leadership again
that is a very uh large reality we face
over the past several years. We've seen
a high turnover in our our local
superintendent. Um so again that means
people are rolling up. We continue to
have deficits especially at the
principal assistant principal level as
well.
Superintendent, I know you asked for
$10,000 pay raise across the next few
years. What What is average teacher pay
in Georgia now?
>> Um the average I know the starting
average is about 43 44,000
>> starting what's the average though?
Obviously
>> we have
>> just over 70
>> 70,000. Okay. Just over 70,000 would be
average.
>> That's what we thought it was right at
71,000.
>> Okay. Um thank you. There are a lot more
questions. As you know, we're a half an
hour behind right now. We're going to
try to catch up with it. So, please try
to grab the superintendent on your way
out. Uh, while the next presenter is
coming up, thank you so much,
superintendent.
>> Thank you, sir. While the chancellor's
coming up, I do want to take a m minute
to remind you of something that the
superintendent showed you. Our student
count is decreasing, but we're going to
be going up $43 million in the QB
formula because we hold schools harmless
as people are moving in and out of
different school systems. Keep that in
mind as you debate things for the next
few weeks.
I would like to remind anybody if
they're standing, do not lock your
knees.
Please lock. Don't lock your knees. Come
on up, Chancellor.
Good afternoon,
Chairman Tiller, Chairman Hatchet,
members of the committee. I appreciate
the opportunity to stand before you
today to talk about our university
system of Georgia. Also want to thank
you for the investment that you've made.
Thank Governor Kemp for the all that the
steady support of USG. And I think
things that I follow, you're going to be
very proud of the investment that you've
made to help us to teach and conduct
research and uh serve communities and
partner with employees and more Georges
so they can thrive and our state can
thrive as well.
You probably know that the University
System of Georgia is one of the largest
state public education systems in the
country. 25 institutions that serve
every region of our state. And simply
what we do is straightforward. Educate
students, meet workforce needs,
strengthen communities, and steward
taxpayer dollars responsibly. So, we're
focused on how we can better serve the
public, be more efficient, and
demonstrate value, which is, I believe,
is what you all are after with investing
the taxpayer dollars of Georgia. So,
when we talk about higher education,
we're talking about opportunity for the
students, the families, and the credit.
And I want you to know that the credit
goes to you. The word you see on the
screen is probably one you're going to
hear a little bit this year. It's the
Webster definition of the word of the
year, affordability in that regard. And
I want to show you all what you all have
done to make higher education in the
University System of Georgia affordable
for its students over the last several
years in that way. We're talking about
affordability.
In the national conversation, you often
hear here in Georgia and nationally that
education, higher education costs too
much. And to some degree that is uh
that's
probably a concern that many people
have. But I want to show I want to give
you the facts today about how the wise
investment you all have made how it has
affected the students from Georgia here.
We worked long hard the board of regents
has worked hard to keep tuition and fees
in check. The board of regents has held
the line on tuition for most instate
undergraduates in seven of the past 10
years. And with yours and Governor
Kemp's help, we've eliminated the
special institution fee, thereby
reducing the cost for Georgians to earn
their degree. I've sat where you sat and
many times I thought as as you move
forward, agencies move backwards and
continue to want more. And I want to
show you some numbers today that show
you that I believe the border regents
and uh the system of Georgia has
actually stepped forward with you in
getting a better value for that. When
you look at the
on the screen, these numbers on the
screen, those are facts there. And the
good news is we've been working on that
for years because we take our
responsibility seriously to be good
stewards of your taxpayer dollars and
deliver real value for Georgia families.
In that regard, on this slide, you can
see that the tuition and fees from TW
2021 today. I imagine if you in your
districts, you said, "Do you believe
your students are paying more for
tuition fees today than in 21?" I
imagine the answer would be
overwhelmingly yes. These are the facts
based on the Department of Audits there.
They've got the report, but honestly, I
thought I'd give all of you this handout
because you can respond to your
constituents who talk about the cost of
our education has gone up. The cost of
living has definitely gone up.
Obviously, food, transportation,
insurance, health care, all those things
have gone up. housing, room, board,
those have gone up. Well, your tuition
and fees based on what you all
appropriate over the last seven years.
These are the facts on the screen we're
here today. So, we're trying to help
students keep lower lower cost by
finishing faster as well. I know that uh
several of you asked about with the
investment that you are all making in
the dual enrollment, how has that
affected the return on investment for
our university system? We're we're
continually asking our presidents, what
is your under four graduation rate for
your dual enrollment students? And that
we just finished 25 budget hearings last
Friday and many of those were reporting
uh graduation years of under four under
four years for their dual enrollment
system. So we're trying to harvest that
investment that you're making in dual
enrollment that come on and metriculate
in our university system as well. So
reducing total cost strengthen the
return on your state's investment and
that will guard. So as we focus on
affordability, efficiency and degree
completion, our efforts in workforce
development keep Georgia's talent
pipeline strong and set graduates up for
success. I've long said since even since
Governor Miller started and with the
hope scholarship that as higher
education goes, Georgia follows two
generations later. And because of
Governor Kemp's continued investment
here and recruiting jobs, talent has
become the key word and the and the
count to talent to workforce is what we
do and we take it very seriously. Across
USG, every campus plays a role in
Georgia's competitiveness from research
breakthroughs to teacher preparation to
work for work workforce aligned
credentials to nursing and healthcare.
Employers tell us they need talent. They
also need problem solvers who can
communicate, adapt, and think
critically. We're committed to producing
graduates who can do both. In fact, you
may have heard me tell our presidents
that the degree that I'm most interested
in is an FIO degree. And they say,
"Well, I've never heard of that. What is
that degree?" I said employers and the
communities and the come tell me they
want students who can come out walk that
stage and come to work on Monday with a
figure it out degree and that's what
we're trying to train our schools across
that figure it out how you can think and
contribute to the challenges and
solutions in the workforce so it's when
we educate talent here that talent's
more likely to stay here as you know and
that's how communities and businesses
grow together so the impact is
measurable immeasurable USG represents
It generates a $23.1 billion economic
impact and supports more than 168,000
jobs statewide. The return return for
students here is clear as well. Our
bachelor's degree earned about $1.4
million more than a lifetime than they
would with a high school diploma. That's
not our numbers. That's kind of uh uh
professor Jeffrey Hump, Dr. Jeffrey
Humphers of the University of Georgia
and his economic output every year. It's
still and growing $1.4 million career
earnings over a lifetime. So, here's a
headline that ma matters most for
Georgia's workforce in our budget
enrollment. And you can see that
nationally, Georgia colleges are
competing for fewer traditional age
students and you saw that in the
previous report about high school
graduates and kindergarteners starting.
You've heard about the demographic
cliff. Our solution to the demographic
cliff is is uh mar is uh getting more
margin, more market in there and getting
particularly adult learners coming back
that have maybe have some credits, some
debt and no diploma. Those are the 1.4
million Georgians that we're also trying
to recruit to finish their degrees as we
go forward. This fall we en enroll more
than 380,000 students across our
institutions. That's a record. That's
more than 17,000 students above last
fall's total and a yearover increase of
4.8%.
That's in the light of the democratic
clip demographic cliff that began last
last summer. We're also being growth
among firstear students, transfer
students, dual enrollment students, and
as well as adult learners. Part of the
success is due to the funding that you
all did for Georgia Match, which helps
students understand their options and
encourages them to take the next step.
Those students who may not have even
thought they could attend college or
compete have now tried it and over
increased over 10% of our applications
last last year. These will be productive
students who are successful going
forward. So USG is meeting students
where they are offering clear clear
pathways to and credentials and degrees.
Enrollment growth is not just a victory
lap. I want to stress that we we've kind
of grown out of the COVID downturn, but
we don't think enrollment is just the
victory lap. That's not where we're
asking. It's our responsibility because
when we get them in the door, when more
students say yes to USG, we must deliver
on student success, affordability, and
completion. That means progression from
the first year to the second year.
moving on from the second to the third
and then from the third to that diploma
in the fourth year in that way.
I know many people like to talk about
six-year graduation rate. I'm kind of a
four-year graduation rate guy. So,
that's what we're telling the presidents
as well. And that means 15 hours per
semester for eight semesters. See you.
Here's your diploma. Go to work. Our our
goal is not only to enroll students, but
our goal is to graduate them in fiscal
year 2025. USG institutions regard
recorded a record 82,67
degrees, a 7.9%
increase in degrees, the largest
year-over-year rise we've seen over the
last decade. That is the goal. In fact,
some of our presidents have diplomas in
all of their faculty's offices showing
that is the goal. As students come in
for meetings, look there. I'm glad
you're here. We want you to have a good
time and a great campus experience, but
that's the objective. If you don't
finish up with a diploma, we've not
we've not succeeded and you've not
succeeded. So, let's focus on that. So,
even better, since 2011, listen this
number. The number of degrees awarded
has increased by more than 50% since 11
in in just 15 years. We're also seeing
growth in master's degrees, other
advanced credentials that directly
support workforce needs, including
teachers seeking deep deeper
specialization and professionals moving
into leadership roles, which was one of
your questions earlier. Ladies and
gentlemen, these are not just
statistics. They are nurses, teachers,
engineers, scientists, big business
leaders, and and public servants that go
out among us and create this vibrant
economy that we have in the state of
Georgia. That's what we're looking for.
That's our role. That's our
responsibility to USG. So, keeping
tuition and fees down matters, and we've
worked hard to do that for many
students. But the real pressure isn't
just tuition, it's the full cost of
attendance. As you well know, hope is a
merit-based program that has changed
Georgia's trajectory and as Governor
Kent mentioned, is a model all across
this country. It literally I was sitting
in your seat when we did that. It
literally changed the whole culture of
USG going forward in that way and we
continue to attract the best and the
brightest not only here at home but from
across the country and to want to come
to metriculate at our USG institutions.
So the reality is frankly that you well
know many of our students have a
financial need in order to attend
college. For students who demonstrated
financial need, the gap also includes
housing, meals, transportation, books,
and unexpected expenses. I'm grateful
and very appreciative to Governor Kemp
for his recommendation to you all to
invest 325 million in the US Dream SC
USG dream scholarship program with the
expectation that USG and our
institutions will privately raise
matching funds. This is a one-time
endowment that I've committed to the
governor that we're going to go back and
try to match it one, two, three times
here with philanthropic funding across
the country with national foundations
that can provide an ongoing endowment
for need-based scholarships in Georgia.
I believe it is a historic investment in
Georgia students by funding funding the
first state needed scholarship of its
kind. You all probably remember some of
us have had to apologize that Georgia is
only one of two states in the nation
that don't do not have a needs-based
scholarship. This will take us off that
list and demonstrate that we're serious
about providing higher education for all
of our students regardless of their
ability to pay or not. But I want to say
clearly, I want you to hear me clearly.
This is not a handout. It is a hand up.
Students will have the parameters that
are expected to earn this by their
service, by their workforce, by doing
what they can to provide for themselves,
not just having a gift to come in and
apply and get money. This is uh
this is important. And I want you all to
hear that we we are making those
parameters very clear and communicating
that to all of our campuses that way,
which that may include public service or
internships here and other places in
that way where they're earning and
working on campus and other places to
make their way as well. The data,
however, is clear.
Did you realize that students who avoid
stopping out because of financial
setbacks are three and a half times more
likely to graduate? Once a student stops
out, and sometimes it's just a few
hundred dollars, 300, 400, $500, Georgia
State has shown through their Panther
grant. Sometimes money as less as $1,000
means a difference between them getting
a diploma or stopping out, going out of
school with some credit hours, a lot of
debt, and no diploma. That's what we're
trying to stop here with this dream
scholarship.
investment gives us the momentum to
bring private donors alongside the state
committee commitment and open doors for
more Georgians. As I visited with
philanthropic groups, very substantial,
wealthy philanthropic education groups
across the country, do you know what
they asked me? What's Georgia doing
today? You've got the opportunity this
year to do something to demonstrate to
them that we're putting our money, the
taxpayers money, where our mouth is
about all students in that regard. And I
hope you'll consider this very seriously
in that regard. I'll be happy to answer
any questions about that. We've already
noted and seen small instances of where
need-based support can move the needle.
The Georgia College completion grant
launched just two years ago thanks to
the work of chairman Chuck Martin. I
told him he shouldn't leave a while ago.
I was going to call him out, but uh
okay, he got back in. Thank you, Chuck,
for that. That helps students bridge the
financial gaps that might otherwise
prevent them from graduating. And we
want to just continue to do more of that
with this dream scholarship. Enrollment
and affordability mean little if
students do not progress and complete
their studies. We're on it, folks. I'm
telling you, the presidents are tired of
hearing me. What's your retention rate?
What's your graduation rate? What's your
four-year graduation? What's your under
four-year graduation? What is your
fiveyear graduation? I don't want to
hear about your six-year graduation
rate, but we're on it and try doing
that. We're using data to identify
students who need help earlier, connect
them with advising and tutoring, and
remove barriers that delay graduation.
We're also simplifying the transfer
process so students don't lose time or
credits when they move from one
institution to another, including our
our friends and cousins in the TCSG.
Better transfer pathways are good for
students and good for efficiency and
better graduation rates earlier. In
addition, as the governor mentioned at
uh eggs and issues, we're partnering
with his office and sister agencies to
address career navigation, getting
students in the right place at the first
time, enabling students to connect with
academics that apply to their career
aspirations earlier. It's something I've
been advocating since I became
chancellor, knowing that our high school
career counselors are there dealing with
many other issues rather than college or
careers going forward. So this will also
enable that. So uh it will provide
students with personalized guidance to
help them match academic pursuits with
career goals. We're also aligning
academic programs with workforce needs
through a more agile program review
process that includes clear evidence of
job demand and expected outcomes. One of
the state's most urgent workforce needs,
as you well know, is health care. Across
USG, we're expanding capacity in nursing
and other high demand health care
professions while maintaining quality
and clinical readiness. That means more
capacity where we can responsibly grow
it as well as stronger clinical
partnerships and simulation experiences
that prepare students for modern
practice on day one. It also means
strengthening faculty pipelines and
clinical placement capacity because
quality depends on instruction and
supervised practice. Georgia has only
currently only one medical school today
you know at Augusta University and uh we
are grateful for the valuable work that
medical college has been doing for
almost 200 years even as we recognize
the challenge that creates that that
creates for physician supply. So, thanks
to you all, Governor Kemp's support,
we're moving forward with the University
of Georgia School of Medicine, which is
building a new medical education
research facility scheduled for
completion in just December of this
year. That's moving fast, folks. As we
expand medical education, we must also
expand residency opportunities so
doctors can train and stay here in
Georgia. Georgia, as you know, retains
physicians at higher rates when they
complete their residency here. So our
focus is on a full pipeline medical
education, graduate medical education
and the clinical partnerships that keep
talent in state.
Obviously
MDs are not the only medical
professions. Dental health is also
important and that's why that oral
health is where Georgia must grow its
workforce especially in rural
communities. You know those some of
those stats sad statistics about healthc
care availability in some of our rural
counties. That's why Augustus
University's d uh dental college of
Georgia uh Georgia the university system
and Georgia Southern and St. Joe's
Counselor are collaborating on a new
dental education facility on Georgia
Southern's Armstrong campus in Savannah.
Thanks to the state, your investment of
$178 million in this project, we'll soon
see more clinical care rooms, labs,
classroom, and facility space, faculty
space, all designed to expand training
capacity, and helping Georgia address
Georgia's dental shortage. We're
targeting the first class of 50 students
in the fall of 28, building the
partnership that's already established
the Medical College of Georgia's
presence on Armstrong campus. So let me
share some encouraging news from one of
our key health partnerships. This should
excite all of us. This is really again I
appreciate and thank you all for
trusting us just about three years ago
as we moveg into partnership with
WellStar. In late December, WellStar
announced a transformative $50 million
philanthropic gift from Tom Gulasana to
the Wellstar Children's Hospital of
Georgia which is affiliated with Augusta
University's Medical College of Georgia.
This is one of the commitments we
negotiated when we talked about this
partnership is that the children's
hospital would remain vibrant and
strong. This is just adding fuel to that
commitment. This is the largest gift in
both WellStar and the children's
hospital history. In recognition of that
gift, the hospital will be renamed the
Wellstar Golden Stana Golden Sana CH
Children's Hospital of Georgia. It'll jo
it'll join the Golens Alliance, a
national consortium of 12 leading
children's hospitals. It will be the
only consortium's only member hospital
in Georgia. The first step will be a new
state-of-the-art ped pediatric cardiac
intensive care unit. From there, this
investment will expand innovation,
improve access, and deliver world care
class care for children and families
across Georgia. Just like for the state
strategic reserves or our rainy day
fund, and you'll hear more about that
this year, they save Georgia taxpayers
money by using dollars that we've
already earned, typically from indirect
cost recovery from federal grants. We
roll over a limited amount of funds from
year to year to cover one-time needs
without borrowing or relying on new
appropriations. And make every October
we give you an extended uh paper
regarding each institution where they
are, what they've spent the money for,
what their intentions are in order to
make sure you all are informed about
this these monies. We track these
balances annually and again to you all
define how they're going to be used and
what they're for. In that regard
includes funds for equipment, technology
replacement, startup costs for new
programs and facility needs.
I need to admit I've got a little bit of
history here. When I became governor, I
wanted to improve government and uh we
created the commission for New Georgia.
One of the recommendations is why don't
we force departments in some places to
spend all their money? I think that
created a use it or lose it. You ever
heard about that budgeting premise? Use
it or lose it because they won't give us
money next year. This is the whole
thought, folks. 50,000 students, even
less, create a small city out here. And
that though, you can't just cut that off
at the end of the year. I want you to be
comfortable in how these funds are being
used. They're limited. Uh 3% of tuition
and then other things that contribute.
And we want you to be part of that and
helping that. But this is saving
taxpayers money. And it's critical in
that regard using sound business
principles where we make our operations
more efficient and effective. One of the
recommendations that came out of that
commission was to allow both USG and
TCSG the ability to carry forward
unspent funds at the university system
and TCSG. Why?
Strategic reserves are planning tool.
They're not money taxpayers are on the
hook for. It avoids that use it or lose
it mentality of spending and helps us to
be better stewards, which I think when
you look over those reports, that's
exactly what you will see. Doing that
protects our investment and enables us
to remain one of the most affordable
university systems in the nation. The
legislation providing that authority
that you all have granted us to
strategically reserve unspent funds from
certain funds sources was first passed
in 2003.
It was renewed in 2006, 2009, 2012,
2015,
2018, 2021.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need your help.
Again, it expires this July, and I
sincerely appreciate the fact that you
want to be mindful of that and
responsible for that, and we will commit
that. But we need that strategic reserve
renewed this year. Also critical to
long-term planning is our use of our
physical spaces and classrooms. This
ties into efficiency and student
success. That brings me to a basic
stewardship question. How do we make the
best use of what we already have? That's
a foundational financial question. How
do we take what we've got? It's a great
university system and every president
wants more and more more. But what I ask
the question, what are you doing with
what you have now? That's the question I
know that you all are asking of us as
well. If we expand access and make
smarter use of our schedules,
we are strongly encouraging campus to
support a imagine this strange
phenomenon, a full week of classes, five
days. That's horrible, isn't it? We're
suggesting that Friday works as well on
campuses and and people love to come to
class on Friday so we can serve more
students without expanding square
footage.
Renovation isn't just cheaper, it's
smarter as well. Across the system,
we're repurposing underused buildings to
meet modern needs. that helps us to
preserve historic assets, reduce
deferred maintenance, and improve
student access impact while still being
careful about what already makes sense
to renovate and what doesn't make sense.
We're also looking at things where it
doesn't make sense in a strong
demolition aspect. Get it out of the
way. Stop the square footage charge that
you all are paying for when we're not
using a building. We're doing that as
well. Institutions manage their own
space dayto-day, but at the USG office,
we conduct system level reviews to make
sure projects align with the strategic
goals. We share best practices so
campuses can learn from one another. The
point simple, our facility strategy is
built on stewardship and efficiency and
utilization.
Here's what else we've learned. I think
to mention we we're demolishing wisely,
maintaining strategic business and
building with a purpose. Spatialization,
cost control, and enrollment trends all
inform our capital decisions. Databased
facts based database decision making.
When we prioritize prior renovation,
adaptive reuse, we preserve value, award
a necessary new construction, and
prepare our campuses for the future.
Every dollar spent is a step toward a
stronger academic environment and a
better experience for the students that
we serve. Mr. Chairman,
I submit to you that the University
System of Georgia is delivering for the
people of this state. We're growing
enrollment in a in a national
environment. We're awarding more degrees
than ever before. We're keeping college
affordable and providing transparent
information about cost and value. And
we're strengthening Georgia's health
care pipeline through nursing growth,
the University of Georgia School of
Medicine, dental education expansion,
and major clinical partnerships. I want
to thank you all, the members of this
committee, the general assembly, and the
governor for all of your support in
allocating the investment of taxpayer
dollars to the university system. And I
want to thank you for your questions and
your partnership. And uh since this is a
budget here, and I probably ought to
turn to some numbers now, if you don't
mind, I'll turn to specifics of the
governor's recommendation for the
amended and next year physical budgets
and capital budget recommendations.
We look forward to working with each of
you this session. Appreciate your
continued support of higher education
university system of Georgia. One of the
major items that you may notice was a
$325 million in needs-based funding aid
that I previously mentioned. I want to
focus on now on the cash funded capital.
That again is an environment endowment.
It's a one-time type of commitment, not
something you'll be expected to to fund
next year. That's on our shoulders and I
commit to do that. One of the major
items is that you'll see in the cash
funded additions in the amended Georgia
Tech the 88.2 million for a new
aerospace engineering building. One of
our major industries in Georgia. If you
go to that building, you'd vote for that
in a heartbeat. If you looked at what's
going over there, UG is 5.6 million for
nursing school design at the University
of Georgia, 11.4 million for medical
school equipment. And I appreciate we
have wisely used the additional MR money
in helping deferred maintenance over the
last couple years. We appreciate that.
The governor's recommended it again and
will continue to do and relieve us of uh
in older campuses of buildings that need
help. Again, our total operating budget
grows to 3.87 billion, 7.5% higher than
FY26 due to enrollment growth. So to
totally increase roughly $27 million $70
million
216.5 million as for formula enrollment
growth university system of medical
school in Georgia also has that you know
healthc care insurance and retirement
adjustments over 36 million 4 million
for retirement rate increases
other notables are 2.8 8 million to
establish the Institute of Civic Thought
Leadership at Georgia Tech. And you
know, many other states have done that.
We think it's time that Georgia again
started something where we can help
students to understand civil debate and
create a culture of western civilization
taught here in the state of Georgia.
Now, on to some of our capital requests.
The slide, this slide shows the
governor's capital recommendations for
FY26, which include $118 million.1
in support of capital projects. For
time's sake, I'm not going to go through
all the list, but I'm happy to talk with
you about any of these as we go forward.
This concludes the overview and
operating and capital budget
recommendations, Mr. Chairman. So, thank
you again to you all, Governor Kemp and
the General Assembly for your continued
support of higher education university
system of Georgia. I hope that you
believe as I do that you're getting a
good return on the taxpayers's
investment in higher education and
talent flow. I look forward to any your
question, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you, Chancellor. We got three or
four. Uh Leader Hugley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh Mr.
Chancellor, I'm on on the other side of
the room over here. Um, I want to uh
congratulate you all on this dream
scholarship, but I do have a question in
terms of how did you come up with a
$3,000 amount and is there a maximum
over the course of a student's career
that they can receive under this
scholarship?
>> That's the $350 to $3,000 is a per
annual type of thing. And the that would
be no more than that per year.
Yes, but you talked about four years,
five years, four years.
>> So, it's just for four years.
>> Uh the other the other thing um
is I'm glad that you mentioned the uh
that we need to get out of the use it or
lose it mentality and allow our
institutions to use strategic carryover
for planning. And I hope that we will uh
do that. that that's something that our
local university and technical schools
are very concerned about that. So, thank
you for championing that.
>> Thank you, ma'am.
>> Chairman Burns.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and uh thank you,
Chancellor. I appreciate your leadership
hiding in the corner. U I especially
appreciate your focus on degree
completion and uh your measurements of
less than four years, four years, and
greater than four year graduation rates.
Do you have a baseline that we can begin
to measure the progress in that area? Do
you have a baseline for under three,
excuse me, under four, four, and more
than four?
>> I think Senator, the best thing to do is
let me provide you every institution's
uh uh numbers on those. There's no
baseline. For instance, I' we've asked
them all to report what it is. So I
think the best way we can do to provide
it to you and others who are interested
over what there's under four, the four,
the five, and the six is for graduation
completion. But that's the goal. And I
appreciate you being a stalward in and
pressing that issue of of harvesting
investment that we're making in dual
enrollment in that regard. And uh we
want to we want to we're delighted to
show you those numbers.
>> Thank you,
>> Chairman Newton.
>> Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chancellor, thank you
for your stewardship over the system and
uh for so many years of service. Um you
did mention,
>> can you speak up, Chairman Newton?
>> You did mention a few things about um
affordability, which I think was was
helpful in particular the the the
decrease after adjusting for inflation
and tuition at least tuition and fees
that have gone down. Can you tell us any
more about that? You mentioned how the
presidents are encouraged to look at
four-year graduation because the number
of years you're you're paying that
tuition obviously matters if it's five
or six instead of four. Uh what are some
ideas that you're doing? Is there a
particular goal? Does it vary for all
the different schools? I know we have 25
different ones. Sure. But can you tell
us any details on how that encouragement
is going?
>> A great question. Honestly, one of the
things we're really looking at is there
some magic about 120 credit hours and
and is that what qualifies as a
bachelor's degree? So, we're we're
seriously investigating that. We're also
focusing on shorter term credentials,
um, badges, certificates, and things
like that where people can come and, uh,
maybe already in the workforce getting
upskilling, uh, efforts that way. But,
uh, obviously the completion is what
really what we're on. And, uh, as I I
tell the president what I told you, I'm
not really interested in your six-year
graduation rate. I'm interested in your
fouryear and under four-year graduation
rate.
>> Thank you, sir.
Chairman Watson,
hold on.
>> Thank you, Chancellor. Certainly is
great to see the tuition decrease over
the years. I I just wanted a
clarification on the the line item you
had said showed a I think it looks like
it was a reduction of 4.6 million of AU
MCG uh campus. Uh can you just help me
understand that a little bit?
>> Yeah, that was the money that was put
ahead before they earned with the
expectation that money now will be
earned in that regard. So that's why
it's taken about out of the base there
at the four million mark that you
mentioned there because you would put
that in for the last two years and help
before the earning of the credit hours
come about.
>> Representative Glaze.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chancellor. I wanted to
ask on the dream scholarship, is it
stackable and is the dream scholarship
will it be the priority?
It is uh PEL will continue and any other
contribution they made it is it is on
top of that it's a gapbased funding that
way that will help them not stop out
because of finances.
>> Thank you for
representative Evans.
Is that you?
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Chancellor, Secretary, Governor. Good to
see you. Um, on the needs-based
scholarship, you mentioned, and I think
the the budget says match, I think the
governor said this morning, a billion
dollars in private funds. And I was
wondering, is that something that the
regents are raising? Is that something
the member institutions are raising? And
how far along are we and who do we have
to thank for those private funds?
>> Well, we're just beginning since the
governor's announcement. Obviously, I
was not able to talk about a match prior
to that time, but u that's on me and
that's on our development. That's on our
USG foundation, that's on our regents,
and that's on the philanthropic
community of Georgia, but nationally as
well as I've gone to national
philanthropic educational foundations.
The question I mentioned to you earlier
was what I get. What is the state doing?
Now, I can take this $300 million and
say, here's a state speaking up. Now, we
need you to come alongside. My goal is
to probably
my personal goal is about five times I'd
love to have a million billion and a
half in there as an endowment that would
throw off cash for the foreseeable
future need-based scholarship.
>> And one followup, there's currently
about 2.5 billion in unrestricted
lottery reserves. Has there been any
discussion of pulling any funding from
that? Um last year we allocated an
additional 163 million I believe. Um but
we also put back 105 million. So we're
we're really not spending down that
extra reserve. And I was wondering if
that had been thought of as a source.
>> Uh it had been considered obviously uh
we need to be very jealous of the hope
scholarship that continues. Those lines
can cross very quickly. the government's
concerned about that and I I been to his
judgment and the OPB's judgment about
that in that way. I'm very uh I'm very
high on Gretchen Corbin and the
continued advancement of the of the
Georgia Lottery and uh obviously that
would be for your discussion. I'd like
to raise this money privately with the
state's step up of $300 million. I'd
love to raise the rest of the money f
privately across this country for the
benefit of our students. I think it's
going to be well received.
>> Thank you,
>> Representative Edna Jackson.
>> My voice is gone. Thank you very much. I
think it's a wonderful program. My my
question is will this operate through
the financial aid office on each of the
campuses and will there be criteria for
the me for those students need that that
you get a need based uh grant will it be
determined by the staff and how is the
criteria going to be set up set up would
it be the same for every institution or
every institution determine the need to
base students through their financial
aid office or or how else they do it.
>> If I understand your question, Mr. Ed,
it will be administered by the state by
the in local institutions who are used
to dealing with financial aid. They're
the ones with the FASA that understand
what the needs are and they can uh they
can calculate the unmet need that every
student has. We will prorrate and
allocate based on a formula of capacity
and uh enrollment out to institutions
over where that money would go in that
regard. But they would be responsible
for administering that. We don't want to
spend any money setting up a new
bureaucracy in the foundation anywhere
else. It would take money away from the
students.
>> Chairman Carpenter,
>> thank you. Uh Chancellor, thank you for
this. Um, I I do want to ask you as far
as setting up I'm over here. Okay. First
thing I would say is don't hold the
University of Georgia at hostage because
they have like four and a half year
graduation rates because a lot of people
like that extra fall uh because of
football. So don't don't penalize them.
It's not a slap. Um the question is uh
as far as setting up those parameters
for for this uh needsbased scholarship
which I think is needed um concern that
that maybe the legislature wouldn't have
a lot of involvement in setting up those
parameters. So that's my question is
will will we be involved in that
conversation?
>> We we would welcome your feedback. uh
honestly these uh parameters will be
transparent and communicated but we
through the session as we develop this
it would obviously be um starting you
know July one but we would welcome any
any ideas and feedbacks uh that could
help in that regard going forward
>> chancellor I think you have completed
the board
>> thank you chairman Hatchet thank you all
>> thank you
Next up is Gresian Corbin with the
Georgia Lottery Commission.
>> Oh, I skipped somebody. Greg Doer,
Technical College System of Georgia.
>> Sorry.
All right, let's
bring the rumble down, please.
Commissioner, I didn't forget about you.
>> I didn't either.
>> Must a fauxa.
>> Commissioner Doer, thank you for being
here and the floor is yours.
>> Am I on? Yep. Thank you, chairman and
committee. And it's an honor to be here.
Um, do want to share we have a new
chairman of the TCSG board, Mr. Buzz
Law, and he has sent most of you, I
think all of you, an email. So if you
see a an email from our new board chair,
he's very excited to serve and willing
to listen to you and serve you as well.
So very proud to have Buzz serving in
that and an honor here to represent our
agency, our 22 colleges, our great
presidents and those that work in
workforce across the system. Um, as you
know and we are very proud, we have a
pretty singular focus on what our
mission is. Our mission is to have a
globally competitive workforce for this
state. And our vision is equally as uh
focused to make sure that everyone in
this state has the opportunity for
economic prosperity by obtaining a skill
which gives them a job which changes
their life, their family's life in this
state.
this this summer when we got together
with leadership across the state, all of
our local boards and our local
foundation boards and we talked about
the state of the system. I want to tell
you that it was a great day and I'll
show you a few things in just a minute
and I want you guys to share in that. Uh
we're going to show you some stats that
we could not say we had without your
support both here in this capitol but
also back home in your communities. And
so as we celebrate, I hope you
celebrate. Um it's plain and simple. The
message that technical education is
connected to prosperity is really
hitting home. And we talked in that
conference about do we believe? Do we
believe we're meeting that mission? Do
we believe we're changing lives? And do
we believe that others believe? And I
think today uh this next chart will show
that your effect on our college system
and our future is strong.
We have had a enormous number of
milestones, but I chose just a few
hopefully to celebrate with you today.
But this current fall semester that we
ended, first time this agency has seen
over a million credit hours in one
semester.
159,280
was the actual headcount enrollment, the
highest since the Great Recession in
2013.
47,496
graduates.
That's the highest we've ever graduated
in one year.
81,400
credentials earned. the same year, which
was last year, for the 47,000
graduates, the highest number of
credentials in a single year. And of
those graduates, a 92% placement in
field, 99% placement overall.
This has been a result of your support,
the governor's support, and our
community support. people understand the
power of technical education and the
investment that has been made in this
system is paying dividends.
As we look at a few of those milestones
that you guys have had your hands in,
one jumped out and that was the dual
achievement program and I want to thank
President Pro Tim Jan Jones for helping
us still perfect that. It's in a pilot
state right now and we're still looking
how to make it better. But in those five
colleges that have a pilot high school,
over 4,179
students who are going to drop out of
high school transferred into the pilot
high schools and are still enrolled in
education with over 727 students
graduating with a high school diploma.
You guys appropriated 1.4 million in
apprenticeships, the high high demand
apprenticeship program, making
apprenticeships in the Georgia the
focus. and we continue to grow and move
to levels we haven't seen before in
apprenticeships.
The governor funded 10.6 million in
grant funds during the co time to
implement an e-learning platform which
we call TCSG connect. That's cross
registration and use of our instructors
across all 22 colleges making sure
students can get classes no matter where
they are across this state.
We have implemented a statewide digital
badging and microcredential
program. Chancellor mentioned and he has
been a great partner and I'll talk more
about that in a minute on articulation
and so many other things. Then he
mentioned short-term programs and micro
credentiing showing that someone has a
skill. We implemented a badging solution
where people can apply for jobs and
that's easily seen.
few years ago you you funded two
additional officers for every uh police
department we had in our colleges. With
those 22 officers, we have enhanced
campus safety, but we've also become the
first state system to become fully state
accredited all 22 police departments.
Top State for Talent executed for the
first a first in its kind nursing
articulation agreement with USG. I
couldn't thank the chancellor more, but
we've talked about the 900 plus
articulations from college to college.
We've talked about opening up pathways
as the chancellor just mentioned, and
the chancellor and his team stepped
forward and said, "We want all of your
nurses to have the easiest pathway to
success on a BSN. Couldn't thank him
more and his team more." We're currently
working on three more of those
articulations.
In addition, we took the standard 28
articulated classes from system to
system and grown that to over 35. Now,
one last thing on this page, we
developed the first ever state workforce
development board approved high demand
career list. This was legislation that
you guys asked for and the governor
asked for. Empowered the state workforce
board to have one common term on what a
high demand career path is. And the
state workforce board has implemented
that. and we're applying that across all
items such as the high demand
apprenticeship program.
You guys are trusting us. We're
executing and you saw the results. It's
making a difference.
Looking at the overall numbers last
year, your technical college system as a
whole served over 592,000
citizens. Across that, if we just start
at the uh the gold 44,000, that's adult
learners. Most of these individuals did
not graduate with a high school diploma,
but they're coming back and either
getting that high school equivalency or
today we can actually issue a high
school diploma to someone who gets those
nine core credits and two technical
certificates.
Last year we served 41,000. So we're
seeing that uptick. If we go in uh the
rotation, the green area, 159,280
technical education students, those that
are working on a credit pathway that
produces a credential or a diploma.
We went up from 148,000 students last
year. The next area is our workforce
area. We owe our title three money.
That's train training or retraining
those that are unemployed or
undermployed as well as serving with
resume and employment services. Last
year we served 133,000 individuals. This
year, as you see, 173,000.
The next one, the dark blue is our
economic development. That's our
customized training. That's a nonredit
pathway, but teaches a skill. mainly our
employers come to us and ask to help
with their employment and their
specialized needs in in your
communities. Last year we did serve
more. We served 147,746.
This year on the charts 129,000.
The caveat on that, we all have caveats
when the numbers go down, right? We
changed the counting systems of how we
actually number um those that we served.
We did not have a unified system and
everything was self-reported. We
implemented a unified system that counts
it daily and I believe that we changed
up how we count those numbers. This year
will be the first test but that number
will go up. And the last area is our
quick start services. Last year we
served 65,92
and this year 85,954.
So when you look at those served in your
communities in every area for the most
part we're touching the lives in
different ways and at greater numbers.
I'll spend most of this presentation
because the appropriations state
appropriations is primarily funding the
teched that green area. So you'll see a
little bit deeper dive into the green
area on our technical education.
If we just look at the growth across
technical education, because of the
governor's efforts and your efforts,
this state rebounded quicker than other
states. And so, while other states still
had a negative growth in their two-year
community colleges or technical
colleges, in 2022, we were ahead of the
curve. We had a 3% growth. We then last
year saw a 10.6% growth or year before
last year. And last year, we saw a 9.4%
growth. Just a reminder, the
appropriations acts based on enrollment.
We get funded basically a year and a
half to two years behind on our
enrollment. So when we get to the budget
in a minute, last year you funded us on
a 10.6% growth in the appropriations act
last year. This year our request when we
get to the formula be based on a 9.4%
growth that you see on this chart. I'll
also show you what we're currently doing
in the current semester in just a
minute. just to give that in a credit
hour in a headcount. You guys fund us on
a credit hour. So that's where you saw
the 9.4, but our headcount's up also at
7.1.
And if you dive into strategic
enrollment, those high demand areas,
while we've had an incredible year
overall, it continues to grow in the
areas we want it to in the state of
Georgia. 7.4% growth, almost 19% in
manufacturing, little bit 2% in cyber.
That was huge last year. So, we're happy
where that is. Love to see more,
obviously. Aviation 17, CNA 17, and
nursing and ADN is 20%. In a minute,
I'll show you a reduction in the budget
related to nursing. I'll go ahead and
hit it now since you're seeing that
increase in numbers. We had a decrease
based on rewriting the curriculum where
we have more students in nursing, but
our credit hours went down in nursing.
So, when I get to that in a minute,
it'll look a little odd. You'll probably
think, well, he just showed me an
increase and now he's talking about a
decrease. We had an increase in
students, a slight decrease in credit
hours. We'll talk about that more in
just a minute.
But this current fall, what will you see
next year in the appropriations process?
This is just a little test. Obvious
taste, obviously, we haven't finished
the year, but this current fall over
last fall was up 7.9% in student
headcount. It's up 9.2% 2% in credit
hours, which is what our funding is
based on. And as I've already mentioned
on that first slide, we had a,6,925
credit hours. Students are showing up
and they're taking more and more credit
hours, meaning they're getting out
faster. It's an incredible story and it
shows well for our workforce of the
future. Diving into those fall numbers a
little little deeper, we talked about
the enrollment already, credit hours
over a million. we already talked about,
but I often get asked about dual
enrollment versus traditional. So, I
want to make sure you saw that our
growth is in both areas. Our traditional
student went up from 79,000 to over
85,000
fall over fall. Our dual enrollment
student also went up 33,000 to 36,000.
And our high demand areas that we track
have gone up from 25 to 27. I believe
what this shows you is is we're getting
the word out to everyone across the
state of the power of technical
education. They're finding us and
they're focusing in on the right areas.
Very excited about the work of our
colleges. We have 22 dedicated
presidents and a staff out there that's
really reaching everybody across our
system.
Looking at our adult learner so far this
current fall, you notice last year we
served around 40,000. We will continue
to serve and and break that record this
year. But current year to date, 20,000
enrolled IETS, you may go, what is that?
IET is an integrated educational
training pathway. That's a lot, right?
What's that mean? It means you leave
with a credential. Not only are you
getting your high school education
either through a equivalency or a
diploma, but you're leaving with a
welding certificate, you're leaving with
a diesel mechanic certificate. The
studies, I've shared this, but just to
repeat it, the studies show that we're
trying to change lives. Getting the high
school diploma, most people go back to
the same job they have. That's where
their comfort is. But if you give them a
skill, they'll go get a higher paying
job. And so, not only are we educating
folks in getting that high school
equivalency and diploma, but we're
empowering them with confidence to go
get a job that changes their life. Those
IETs we want to see go up. 357 is not
where I'm happy with. Our goal is to
have everybody that graduates out of
there with an IET. And so we're pushing
that and pushing it. Our high school
completion, a little over 1,400.
I mentioned dual achieve, the five pilot
high schools that we're still working
on. We'll continue to work with this
body on perfecting that and hopefully
taking that pilot off at some time. But
just the numbers in themselves,
enrollment this year we're over 1,600
enrolled. College credentials over 900
diplomas this year was 400. But just as
a reminder, the three years it's been in
in uh in in operation, we've had over
700 high school diplomas graduated.
That's folks that were going to drop out
of high school that continued and got
their high school diploma. I'll add in
they also got a credential. Just
remember that 900's powerful.
Georgia match. We could not be prouder
of the governor's focus on the top state
for talent. One of the first initiatives
in that was Georgia match. One of the
areas that I keep driving and hoping
that we change and we're seeing it
change is high school graduates.
The state of Georgia has stayed around
7% for eons, decades. 7% of those
graduating come to your technical
college system. We did not see movement
in that until Georgia Match. When we
sent Georgia Match out and made folks
realize their opportunities before them,
we have jumped from 7% to nearly 10%.
The national average is around 12 to 15%
depending on what year it is. We have a
goal to see that go up to 10 to the 15%.
And so we are so happy about Georgia
Match is making a difference. We're
seeing the impact. Folks at a younger
age are finding their pathway.
A few other things that are in Top State
for Talent, the accelerated career path
in high school with our superintendent
that was here earlier. We continue to uh
navigate our young folks toward a skill
in high school that navigates to your
technical college and then your
university systems. Our articulation
agreements I've already mentioned just
phenomenal with our university system
but also our independent colleges. The
career navigator is on its way as you've
heard. Georgia match we've implemented
the high demand apprenticeship program.
We've spoke about the high demand career
list and our micro credentials. All of
these are making a difference for the
employers in our state. So what does the
budget look like? kind of as the
chancellor said, we probably ought to
talk about those numbers, right? So,
here we are. When you look at this, I'd
ask you to look at the uh second column.
The second column in our amended budget
says onetime salary supplement, and
that's that $2,000 onetime supplement
that the governor mentioned in his uh in
his state of the state. That equates to
13.9 million for TCSG, and it fully
funds our positions. The other singular
change in the amended budget is the next
column where you see other changes. It's
a reduction of one position for
$225,000.
This is a position that was funded in
the uh appropriation act to help with uh
recruiting and employing folks for the
Hyundai uh operation. It's anou with our
partners over at Department of Economic
Development and they just haven't hired
it yet. So the money is going away here,
but they will continue to move forward
with hiring that position.
The last item in the amended budget is
we do have one capital project and that
is 48 million for MR&R for systemwide
critical infrastructure projects. Just
to let you know, uh this is something
that's been greatly needed. So very very
thankful to the governor. We have over
13.5 million square feet across our
system. When you look at that, we have a
high need for roof replacement, HVAC
projects, uh, parking lots, plumbing,
fire suppression. All of the items on
this are at end of life. Of those, 48%
of the projects in the 48 million are
HVAC projects, 25% are roofing, and the
rest are fire suppression, plumbing, and
parking lots. We'll be happy to provide
that breakdown as we get into the
budget.
Looking at the big budget, it'll be over
the next two pages, so I don't have a
total on this one, but the first item is
the statewide spreads that you see in
the first column by program. Those
statewide spreads are just over uh $20
million, $20,9.99.
Most of that, as you've already heard
from other agencies, is in the healthc
care insurance premiums going down. A
little over $21 million of that is
healthc care premiums going down. It's
going up in TRS. It's going up in our
premiums to DOAZ, GTA, Telkom, and our
Georgia Works program. So, $21 million
cut for healthcare. The rest is adback.
The offset at the bottom of the line
when we get to the next page will be a
little over 20 million for those
statewide spreads. Looking at the
workload and other adjustments, you'll
see that that cut again, the 225 for the
position I've already mentioned. and
then we'll flip to the next page and
talk about some new items.
Going down the workload and other
adjustments formula, I mentioned to you
9.4% increase in credit hours in my
presentation. That formula results in a
$33.5 million ad to our budget. In
addition, in our formula, we have a
square footage based on how we do our
operations. So, our formula is based on
the credit hours covers our personnel
cost. The square footage covers
everything else. So if you think about
plumbing, brake fixes, contracts for
custodial, landscaping, all of that, we
had a 0.92%
increase in that square footage. It
resulted in a 553,000
ad in in that part of our formula.
The next part is the one I've already
mentioned. I'm sorry, it's not the one
I've already mentioned. I'll get to it
in a minute. The next one is a decrease
of 4.7 million for our dual achieve uh
pilot project. That is the five high
schools I mentioned. When those five
high schools were originally introduced
to you guys, it had no funding mechanism
and the governor and the general
assembly funded this 4.7 million. There
was changes to the legislation that
connected the folks in that program to
the QBE formula.
So the money goes away that's state
funded and we're supposed to work with
department of education on how we get
money to continue this program. There's
been issues around that funding formula
and we hope this session we're working
with a legislative fix on that to keep
this program going. But this change is
based on the legislative change on where
the funding comes from and we're still
working on that. So I appreciate your
support on this program as we move
forward.
As we look at the next item, I mentioned
to you we were very blessed and I want
to thank this body. Um gosh, four years
ago, Mr. Chairman, uh this body started
going down the road of really looking at
some high demand areas that needed
additional funding for expansion. Those
high demand areas that were identified
to make a difference was nursing, CDL,
and aviation.
And so, as we look at those areas, we've
done a great job on making sure those
areas are fully funded. so the colleges
can expand and grow them. Last year I
mentioned the nursing went down, number
of students went up, but because of some
pill changes and also getting folks to
the workforce quicker, the number of
credit hours went down. So majority of
this decrease is related to nursing. We
did have a real decrease in CDL though.
Our numbers dipped has come back this
current fall. So we'll be up again this
year. But that's why you see this
reduction in that high demand area of
748,000.
>> So it's not really a reduction in the
demand. It's just fluctuating.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Mr. Chairman, that's the uh that's the
conclusion of the cash part of it. Uh
but we do have a very nice budget
recommendation from the governor on many
projects going to impact your
communities in capital outlay. The first
several are a continuation of last
year's funding. So the first one is the
final funding for the furniture and
fixtures and equipment for the Atlanta
Tech renovation of the Henry Lewis Hank
Aaron Academic Complex. That's 4.4
million. That was uh an additional
48,000 square feet for advanced
manufacturing.
The next item, last session, we're
blessed to get the design monies of 2.1
million for an advanced manufacturing,
engineering, technology building in the
budget. This year, we're asking for the
26.5 million in construction. As you can
see, the governor recommended half of
that at 13.2 million. So, we'll
obviously be working with you guys,
hoping that we can fully fund that.
The next item is Georgia Pedmont
Technical College building B, the
simulated training hospital where we
partner with G with Pedmont Hospital.
This is the furniture fixtures and
equipment for that project. It was a 11
million project of which this is the
final funding for the project at 1.5
million.
Wet wet technical college has been our
kind of premier automotive uh college.
They have a partnership with Mercedes,
Ford, Mazda, and a host of others. This
is an expansion of over 17,000 square
feet for that project. The total cost
was 8.6 million, of which this is the
final part for the furniture and
fixtures at 1.4 million. And the final
project that was a carry forward from
last year's funding was West Georgia
Technical College building a renovation.
This is electrification and transport
transportation center in Troop County.
This is a renovation of over 37,000
square feet, a total project cost of
around $12 million, and the final part
for the furniture and fixtures at
565,000.
The next projects will be all new
projects as in this budget that we're
hoping to kick off with your support and
thank the governor for his support. The
first one is at Chattahuchi Technical
College, a manufacturing and diesel lab
renovation.
This is a design and construction in
Barto County of $ 8.8 million. The total
projects just over 10.2 million, which
means if this is funded next year, we'd
come back to you on the furniture and
fixtures at 1.4 million. The next item
is Georgia Northwestern Technical
College, the industrials, technology,
and renovation phase two. Last year you
f you well the last couple of years you
funded phase one. Phase one ended up
having a total redo of the
infrastructure. What was found out is
the uh wastewater treatment part of that
and the HVAC was just dilapidated and
falling apart. So with that money, we
were able to actually do all of the
renovation to the infrastructure and
fund uh building C, I mean building uh
D. And in phase two, we'll come back in
having done all of the infrastructure
and be able to renovate building C and F
for $13.3 million in Floyd County.
The next project is at Gwynette
Technical College, the North Fulton
campus, building two. Many years ago, we
built a building one there and it is
maxed out. It primary focus is on
healthc care and IT. This will be the
second building that was planned years
ago when the first one was. We have the
parking lot there and the space is
sitting and waiting. But this will be
the design money for that at 2.2 million
on that Alpharetta campus. The total
cost of that project will be over 33
million with us coming back next year
asking for the 26 million for
construction.
The next project is a fall lines. Okone
fall lines is a diesel lab edition. This
will do all of it, the design,
construction, and FFN there in
Washington County for $5 million there
in Sandersville.
The next project is Oichi Technical
College. It's an automotive and EV
renovation and expansion there in
Bulock. The total project cost is 15.7
million. It's over 19,000 square feet.
And the design part of that is a million
dollars that we're asking for this year.
And the last college project is Savannah
Technical College and it's an expansion
to the aviation campus building there in
Chadam. We have a huge uh partnership
down there and we need to expand it
because we have maxed out. This will
allow us to do three times the students
with over,200 students being served in
that. It's a $19 million total cost
facility with over 26,000 additional
square feet. And the design part of that
is 1.3 million. We're also blessed, and
this is the last item in my
presentation, that the governor
supported an additional college and
career academy at $3 million. As you
know, each year that this is funded, we
run a competition for folks to actually
come in with their communities, their
local communities, their local K12
partners, their technical college
partners put together a plan on actually
implementing this, and this gives them
the seed money to make this happen.
We've been very successful across this
state. That facility remains in in the
K12 environment, but has obviously a
great partnership with your technical
college on the skill side. And this
would be the 57th, I believe, uh, career
college across this state if it's
funded. Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to
answer any questions if there are any.
>> You got a couple. Uh, Chairman Lynn
Smith.
>> Thank you. I'm right in front of you.
And this also goes to my colleagues in
on this room today. Several years ago in
Kawa County, we had our largest industry
tell our school system they could not
hire anybody who graduated from our high
school. That led to indepth study and it
was determined that there were silos of
education that prevented this learning
that was necessary. The silos were your
technical colleges, your K through2 and
your university systems. So the birth of
this is why I'm bragging here started in
Kawita County.
>> It did.
>> But what happened last week is a credit
to what our three presenters are telling
us. The US Secretary of Education
visited our third district, Congressman
Brian Jack. She's visiting all of the
states, but she came to our area because
no one else in the United States has
been able to do what the leadership has
done for the past 25 years. So, it's
phenomenal. And I'm shouting out to you,
but to all of our other presenters as
well. Our general assembly took the
bullets when we passed the ones where
everybody was really mad at us. And so,
it um it's amazing that now we are the
leader for the country. It's a it's an
incredible partnership and Mr.
Whitlock's done an incredible job out
there and it was a great meeting.
>> Chairman Hickman,
>> hey, my my board went blank.
>> Chairman,
>> too. Two two quick things. Um, when will
y'all release the high demand um
information y'all give by recent
districts? So, we know, you know, you
tell us what the high demand for Georgia
is.
>> Yes, sir.
>> But we had a bill a couple years ago
identify by recent districts. So we
we'll get that to you. We have we have
12 different if I remember right 12
different high demand regional areas to
make sure that the state high demand is
not singular. So we'll get that to you.
Yes sir.
>> And and the second second question you
mentioned about overall growth. Are are
all school do all schools have growth or
do we have some that's decreasing or
what what's
>> Yeah. Yeah. Year to year um all schools
have had growth since the last three
years. Year to year, it's been up and
down, but I can tell you last year we
had 21 of 22 colleges have increases,
and the one that did not was slight.
This year, they're already showing
growth. Now, we do have a couple
involved that have a little decrease,
but not much. But overall, uh, pretty
much it's all 22 colleges have really
experienced growth.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Chairman Alan Powell.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to
say I'm over here I just want to send my
compliments to the agency and all the
personnel over there. I've long since
said that the best money in postsecary
education is our tech schools in
Georgia. And given the fact we don't
have a football team over there, then
that puts it far above a lot of other
areas. So, thank y'all for what y'all
are doing.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate your
support.
>> Chairman Burns.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you,
Commissioner. I appreciate TCSG. Uh I I
want to get your insights on
apprenticeships and how we might
continue to enhance that method of
technical and adult education.
>> Yeah, I I think that uh you know we've
been very blessed that this this body
several years ago saw fit to incentivize
uh companies to spend their time and
effort on apprenticeships and it's
paying dividends. And what I mean by
that is for the first time and unlike
many states uh this body put in 1.2 2
million several years ago and then
increased it to 1.4 million uh last year
to help companies who are applying to
have apprenticeship support. Um the
federal government sends down federal
dollars to help pay for training of
apprenticeships. But when you do that as
a company, it takes a lot of paperwork.
It takes a mentor. It takes a
dedication. And sometimes you got to
spur folks on to see the benefit of
that. The result has been is that little
bit of money has extrapolated into more
apprentice. Meaning um as we look at our
power companies,
they went all in on the opportunity and
now that they had the opportunity,
they're hiring far more apprenticeships
than the state actually supported
initially. And so as we look going
forward, there's a few things. Uh we do
not have one entity that actually counts
apprenticeships in this state. TCSG, all
22 colleges are apprenticeship sponsors,
meaning that if a local company wants to
do a USDO apprenticeship, they have to
have a sponsor to support them and help
them navigate that process. All of your
colleges do that, but so do a lot of
nonprofits and other things. And so in
the state of Georgia, we actually can't
tell you exactly how many
apprenticeships we have because there's
not one entity that actually counts
those. And so as we move forward, if we
want to actually profess what I think we
are, I think we're the best, but I
really can't put my finger on it to say
we're the best. We'll have to figure out
a way to actually support that. But if
we can continue supporting our
industries uh as far as supporting them
on actually understanding the power of
apprenticeships, I think that goes a
long way, Mr. Chairman. And obviously,
we've had a few discussions and I owe
you a follow-up discussion.
>> Representative Evans.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Commissioner. Um, I couldn't help but
notice that the needs-based aid is only
in the USG part of the budget, and I'm a
little concerned because I know that
students that attend our technical
colleges are more likely to be lower
income. And while the grant is stronger
than it's been, there's still a gap in
that cost of attendance. And so, I
wanted to ask you, couldn't your
students use that as well? Well, and has
there been any discussion about
including TCSG as a place where students
could use those funds?
>> Yeah, great, great question. Uh, I'm
going to have to follow up with you. We
have not had discussions with the
chancellor or the governor's office on
that yet. Um, but obviously um we're
always looking at how to help our needs
based uh folks. We have a lot of
opportunities, you already mentioned in
the hope grant. Uh we have 18 pathways
that are fully funded both tuition and
uh fees and so there's a lot of
opportunity in our system already but
there are some students that go through
the gaps and we'll have to follow up on
that and get with you.
>> Yes ma'am.
>> Senator James.
>> Thank you.
Uh, Commissioner Doer, I didn't hear you
say anything about um special education
um students.
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Who uh with all of the money? We have uh
some some students who are on the
spectrum who can learn a lot and others.
I want to know if if uh you have any
programs with the monies that we're
getting from the lot lottery
>> and
many of the people who actually play the
lottery and use the lottery
>> they have children who need the help and
so they can become self-sufficient. So
um they need space definitely.
>> Sure. and uh some of the apprenticeships
like the film industry and you know they
don't want to hire people from New York
or from California. They want to hire
people right here and some of those 400
jobs that that they have to hire out.
>> They they have apprenticeships for them.
I was just wondering if we have any any
plans on the table to help these uh
citizens because they're growing up now.
And you know, they even driving cars
some.
>> So anyway,
>> yeah, I I'll have to follow up with you.
I can tell you that we we serve and do
have programs, but I can't give you
specific today, but but be glad to sit
down with you and walk through that.
>> I would like that.
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Representative Liberty County, how we
>> All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
was beginning to wonder this beautiful
black was invisible today.
>> You good to close it out.
>> Good to see you, Mr. Commissioner.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Thank you for your presentation. I just
wanted to bring to light and I know it
obviously did not make the chopping
block or it made the chopping block and
is not on the list but in Liberty County
at the technical college Savannah area
tech campus there we have of course the
largest single base as far as money into
the economy in Georgia over$5 billion
dollar.
>> Yes sir. We I I got a lot of complaints
from military people. The CDL training
center there, it it got to be it can't
be the worst because I know I hadn't
seen the worst, but it's got to be one
of the worst facilities you have in
Georgia. We literally are running
extension cords from one building to the
other because of the light fixtures.
Sighting is falling off, the heating is
terrible. And they have photo pots,
photo toilets for the students there.
And the military folk primarily come
there to try and get CDL license are
highly disciplined.
We want to keep them in Liberty County
over 400 a month exit out. And it's a
terrible picture to have the best state
to do business business in America have
facilities that look like that.
>> Yes, sir. I hear you. And obviously,
it's something we've had on the list and
we need to get it back on there. Yes,
sir.
>> Yes, sir. We do.
>> Commissioner, I got one final question.
>> Yes, sir. Are there any classrooms
you're trying to fill right now that you
can't get a professor for?
>> Mr. Chairman, we we struggle with that
every day across the whole system.
>> Can you tell me what those fields would
be where you're having trouble getting
teachers?
>> Generically, it's all of the high demand
areas where folks can go make a better
living doing the job versus teaching it.
So,
>> can you list some of those for me?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Welding.
>> Welding.
>> Aviation. Okay.
>> Electrical.
>> HVAC. It's just about all of the ones.
>> What about your nurses? Are you
>> nursing? Yeah,
>> very much so.
>> Yes.
>> Hygiene fall in that. Are you okay with
that one?
>> No. No. Hygiene falls into it. We're
struggling down in Vida with that one
just here recently.
>> What
would have been easier for me to last
ask which ones you're not having a hard
time filling?
>> Well, you know, the reality is is
you know, you may see me not answering
specifically because it's a fair
question. That's kind of become the
daily grind of our colleges of making
sure we have the instructors. And so
while it's not easy, we just keep on and
keep on and keep on. Every now and then,
uh, we do have a case. A couple of years
ago, we shut down nursing up at Chatt
because we lost all of our instructors
and it took us about six months to fill
them back. Since then, we've been able
to keep it going.
>> Do those folks have to have a degree or
can they what? And I'm I'm not trying to
go into a 20-minut explanation here, but
if I would think if someone's got 20
years doing HVAC,
>> I'd rather have that guy teaching me
than the person.
>> No. No. It depends on the discipline. Uh
nursing, yes. HVAC, no.
>> Uh but yes, if it's if it's a nursing by
the state board requirements, it
requires a master's level uh instructor
in those nursing programs. At the HVAC,
electrical, all of those. No sir, it
does not. If there are things that we
can clarify and make easier for you,
either through a licensing point or
through a just they've got the on job
training, that's the person you want us
to be doing. If you guys could make a
short list of that, we would be happy to
try to knock that off your list this
year.
>> Thank you. Appreciate that.
>> Mr. Commissioner, that's it.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you, sir.
Now,
Gretch and Corbin
with the Georgia Lottery Corporation.
>> Okay. Right.
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Justin.
on the run.
I like how y'all sit so nicely next to
each other.
>> All right, let's move on.
>> Thank you, Mr. Thank you. Thank you,
Chairman Hatchet and Tillery for the
invitation to join you all and for all
members of this esteemed committee.
Well, good afternoon. My name is
Gretchen Corbin. I'm the president and
CEO of your Georgia Lottery and it is
always a pleasure to be with you at the
beginning of the legislative session.
Many thanks to all of you for your
incredible work on every day and days
like today. It's um and for the lottery
for the support that you provide all
throughout the year. We sincerely
appreciate you. on behalf of Governor
Kemp, the Georgia Lottery Corporation
board of directors, our team, and
especially the hope and prek students
and families who have benefited from the
Georgia Lottery in the past 32 years.
I'm excited to provide an information on
a milestone year with you today. Mr.
chairman, as you know, the good news is
the Georgia Lottery does not receive
appropriations, so you can kind of take
a breather um for requests and but we
all obviously our purpose is to generate
revenue to send back to you to allocate
along with the governor to education for
hope and prek.
So, jumping in a quick a quick snapshot
updated of the Georgia Lotteryy's
record. It's been a big year of
milestones. With our quarterly transfer
in October, we have now returned over
$30 billion dollar to the state of
education since our inception. Mr.
Chairman, when I say we, I mean we. That
was 30 years. Many of you in this room
were there when the lottery started or a
few of you were in the room. Um, and
then also all of you have been
supportive and I want to thank you as
well as not just being supportive but
also possibly being players. Thank you.
So, we have now returned over 30 billion
to the state um for education. We hit
the milestone of our 10th consecutive
year of returning over a billion dollars
to the state with this last fiscal
year's return of 1.471 billion to
education.
Since inception, 2.2 million
four-year-olds have jumpstarted their
education by attending a lottery funded
prek program. And there have been 2.25
25 million hope scholarship and grant
recipients n since 1993 and growing.
Chris may have um an even more updated
number. In fiscal year 25 we made 75 new
millionaires.
And in this fiscal year in 26 just
recently we had our largest prize winner
ever in Georgia lotteryy's history. So
can you imagine this? I have to say
thank you for the great pleasure and
honor of meeting with this winner. A um
a one ticket winner of 983 millions Mega
Millions jackpot win from Nunan ticket
sold in Nunan.
And not only was this national I have to
step back. This was such a great day and
a great week, wasn't it?
Um, and I just want to I do want to back
up and make sure that I share with this
group what the winner said to to me as
to please share with Georgia. Thanks to
all of you. He this winner had the
ability to stay anonymous. But the
Georgia winner did say, Gretchen, please
let everyone in Georgia know how
thankful our family is. That our family
has had hope scholarships or SC hope
scholars who have benefited from the
Georgia Lottery. That we have
continuously played the Georgia Lottery
to support the Hope students. We saw
your advertising on a billboard um when
we were driving down the interstate. And
there were a couple more pieces that it
was just minute by minute by minute that
made this win happen for this winner.
Most importantly, um, this winner said,
"We plan on making this a generational
win and giving back to Georgia." And so
I look forward to watching this as
chills just went down my body um because
I had the opportunity to sit with this
winner and hear from them um exactly
what they planned in regards to the
generational um longevity of this prize
as well as giving back. And I could see
in their eyes just how how smart and how
strong they wanted to um they wanted to
make sure that their winnings were. They
wanted to make sure that they did well
by these winnings. So, I wanted to make
sure that I just stopped and shared that
with you because you made that win
possible the largest win possible for
Georgia, for a Georgia player. And with
that win, because it was a Georgia
winner, um we also had $23.5 million go
back into taxes on just that win. in
addition to the jackpot roll which on a
large jackpot roll that one specifically
bought brought in 27.9 million for hope
and prek.
So how do we return over a billion
dollars every year? You all know it's
all product selling our lottery product.
Our job is to develop the strongest
product possible to go to market to make
all of our players aware of it through
the strongest marketing possible and to
sell the product in the most responsible
fashion ever and specifically to
generate the most money possible to send
to you and the governor to allocate for
hope and prek. We continue to be
innovative with our instant product,
launching four to six games every month,
making investments in digital menu
boards, placing vending in in market to
assist retailers,
and as well with our draw products,
which are some of our most popular along
with our poss our popular nationwide
games. um our our statewide games, Cash
Three, Cash 4, Fantasy 5, Cash Pop,
Georgia 5, all of which have seen
increases year-over-year. Our
interactive platform, which was launched
in 2012, continues to grow
year-over-year. Our interactive platform
is made up of internet and mobile
channels, and we are currently in the
middle of a year-long interactive
platform upgrade, which we are excited
to share with our players this fiscal
year.
We have regulatory responsibilities for
co-am coin coin operated amusement
machines which includes the licensing of
owners and operators for co-ams the
issuance of permits permits for co-ed
machines the collections of license fees
for co-ams collections of net receipts
from class B machines and compliance
COAM is growing licensing numbers as of
the end of Q1 fiscal year 26 were 40,875
machines in market at over 7,000
locations. For fiscal year 25, $192
million was generated from co-en play
return to education. The industry
invests well and they do their best to
generate the most for education. We're
incredibly appreciative of their work.
Um, Chairman Powell, I want to thank you
also. Beginning July 1st, um, thanks to
Chairman Powell's leadership as well as
all of your leadership, COAM redemption
will now, um, go to just lottery product
and gift cards. Um, Chairman Powell
along with all of you have been very
adamant about making sure that cash is
out of the market and we think that that
um, will go far. So, Chairman, thank
you. And to your committee's leadership,
thank you as well.
Um the proposed budget we do not have a
ask but just wanted to note that um
lottery is um noted on pages 15 and 37.
Our year-to- date results as the lottery
works towards our return. I wanted to
share that we are off to our strongest
start in our 32-year history. And a
quick snapshot of Q1 fiscal year 26. It
was the best Q1 with $414.8
million transferred to the lottery for
education account. That profit was 51.3
million higher than Q1 fiscal year 25.
And with that, again, as I've mentioned,
not only did we top 30 billion, but now
30.2 billion for education programs in
Georgia with this last transfer.
Um, I enjoy joining y'all for
Commissioner Doers and Chancellor
Purdue's presentations.
And I have to tell you that when we go
to work at the Georgia Lottery every
day, we go to work with the students own
mind. Casey Carpenter, we go to work
with your son own mind. We go to work
with many of the interns that are in
your offices own mind. Whether they are
in a public school, whether they are in
a private school, whether they are at
H.B.C.U. you receiving hope. We are so
thoughtful of these students. We think
about the families that are taking their
prek student to school in August for the
first time ever and how important that
is. We know that everything that we do,
every dollar we make, every dollar we
spend wisely and every dollar we don't
spend,
we do this with students in mind and
making sure that we are providing the
greatest amount of revenue back to this
legislative body and the governor to
allocate for education. And so with
that, we're having a banner year
barreling toward a positive fiscal year
return. And as always, support
appreciate your support in championing
us. And I have to say, Chairman
Williams, I hear about you talking about
games. And so I want to make sure before
I left that you all know that our
Megaillions Jack fought for tonight is
$250 million. We hope that you will go
to your local retailer and purchase it
there. Mr. Chairman, if this hearing
goes a little long, they can pull out
their app and and play there as well. We
so appreciate you, Chairman Hatchet and
Tillery. Thank you for this opportunity
to present and as always happy to answer
any questions.
>> Any qu any questions?
>> I think everybody's ready to get out of
here and go buy buy a ticket.
Thank you, Gretchen.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> All right.
Next up is Chris Green with the Georgia
Student Finance Commission.
Mr. Green, welcome to the committee.
We'll give these folks a few seconds to
clear out. We're going to go ahead and
get going again. So, if you don't mind
taking your conversations outside of
341,
President Green, go ahead.
Good afternoon. Thank you, Chairman
Tiller, Chairman Hatchet, and members of
the Joint Appropriations Committee. Uh,
my name is Chris Green. I have the
pleasure of serving as president of the
Georgia Student Finance Commission. Uh
thank you for the opportunity to appear
this afternoon to discuss the governor's
amended fiscal year 26 and recommended
fiscal year 27 budgets for GSFC.
Uh since Governor Kemp appointed me to
succeed President Lynn Riley back in
March, we've been working diligently to
ensure GSFC continues to live up to its
reputation for excellence in expanding
access to education for Georgians. Uh we
are very grateful for the resources that
you all provide to us and my goal this
afternoon is to highlight how that trust
has enabled us to expand access to
education, support degree completion,
and make sure Georgia continues to be
the top state for talent. Uh thank you
for entrusting us with this important
mission.
You know, when I tell people I work for
the Georgia Student Finance Commission,
a lot of Georgians may or may not uh
immediately recognize our agency name,
but when I say, "Oh, we administer the
Hope Scholarship." The reaction is
always the same. They say, "Oh, you
know, my my child received Hope
Scholarship or I received Hope
Scholarship." And they say, "Thank you
so much for what you do and for help
making college more affordable for my
family." Uh, I know we have some new
members with us today. And so I wanted
to briefly highlight how our agency is
really made up of three different legal
entities that help us accomplish our
mission. Uh the Georgia Student Finance
Commission is the umbrella state agency
uh which is the name most often used to
refer to all three entities. But the
Georgia Student Finance Authority and
the Georgia Education Savings Authority
are separate legal entities, but the
three work together uh to help us
accomplish that mission.
We'd like to begin with a few agency
highlights that demonstrate the scale
and responsibility of our work. GSSC
supports hundreds of thousands of
students across the state through
scholarships, grants, outreach, and
administrative services. Over the past
year, we have continued to modernize our
operations, improve system performance,
and strengthen internal controls to
ensure we continue to be good stewards
of public funds. These operational
improvements allow us to focus resources
where they matter most, directly
supporting students and families. As you
can see here, there continues to be
strong growth in the dual enrollment
program, which exceeded 71,000 high
school students, taking more than
736,000
credit hours during the last academic
year. In October, we launched the third
cycle of the nation's largest state-run
direct admissions program by mailing
more than 136,000 letters to high school
seniors as part of the Georgia Match
campaign. I'll speak more about Georgia
Match in just a moment. We take our
mission seriously, utilizing a
combination of technology and individual
face-to-face engagements to disperse
more than 635,000
scholarships and grants last year. Thank
you. To do that, we conducted 1,600
outreach events drawing more than 92,000
participants.
Gafutes.org, our one-stop college
planning website, attracted more than 5
million visits and over 230,000
new accounts created. We owe that
tremendous success to more than
marketing efforts. We partner closely
with high school counselors, teachers,
and administrators in your districts uh
to make sure that students h are
connected with these financial resources
that you provide uh to make sure they
can continue their education here in the
Peach State.
Finally, our Reach Georgia scholarship,
which combines need-based aid with
mentoring, academic coaching, and
additional community support, exceeded
5,400 students since this program was
created by Governor Deal. For each of
these categories, there are numerous
stories of lives changed and improved
because of your investment in access to
education. We wouldn't have the talent
pipeline available to the businesses in
and industries here without this
investment. So again, I say thank you
for your support of GSFC and these
programs.
Ladies and gentlemen, this slide
reflects the magnitude of your
investment and how we administer those
funds to students. In the most recent
fiscal year, GSSC dispersed more than
$1.1 billion dollar in program funds to
Georgia students. These dollars support
a wide range of programs, including hope
and zelmiller scholarships, need-based
grants, and targeted workforce related
initiatives.
By far the largest portion, nearly a
billion dollars, was distributed through
hope programs like the Hope Scholarship,
the Zel Miller scholarship, Hope Grant,
Hope Career Grant, and others. I know we
are all proud of the legacy that hope
has had on our state which has
positioned us to become a national
leader in the amount of aid awarded to
students. This is due in large part to
the good work of the Georgia Lottery
Corporation under the leadership of
President Corbin. Uh and so I just want
to formally say thank you again to the
Georgia Lottery for the historic
partnership that makes this possible.
Beyond the hope programs, you can see
the commitment to dual enrollment
followed by the tuition equalization
grant which goes to students attending
our independent colleges.
The next largest slice goes to other
programs such as the inclusive
post-secary education grant or IPSY
grant uh which goes to students with
disabilities uh the scholarship for
engineering education reach and the
public service memorial grant among
others.
The Georgia College completion grant is
next and it helps eliminate the gap in
aid and cost of attendance as students
near the completion of their degree.
I'll also say more about that program in
just a moment. And the focused
investment you all continue to have in
our military programs includes the
Georgia Military College State Service
Scholarship, the Georgia National Guard
service cancel loan, uh the Georgia Hero
Scholarship, and multiple programs at
the University of North Georgia. Uh the
takeaway here is not just volume but
accountability. Every dollar represents
a commitment to transparency,
compliance, and measurable impact.
I know you all have heard a great deal
today about the Georgia Match program
and could not agree more that Georgia
Match is one of the strongest examples
of how our agency supports the state's
education and workforce agenda. Uh
through this program, eligible high
school seniors receive direct admission
offers from Georgia public colleges and
universities based on that high school
hope GPA. For the class of 2026, more
than 136,000 students received letters
across our state. Uh the heat map here
uh shows where students received a
letter as represented by the light blue
dots and where students claimed a spot
as indicated by the dark blue spots. Uh
thanks in part to Georgia Match, there
have been enrollment increases for USG
and TCSG. While many states faced
enrollment declines, USG enrollment has
increased for three consecutive years,
reaching an all-time high of 382,000
students. TCSG also set new records this
year with 159,000 students who took more
than a million credit hours last
semester for the first time.
The quality of institutions in Georgia
and their excellent reputation certainly
contributes to our growth, but the
impact of the Georgia Match program is
undeniable. Governor Kim's vision when
he convened the leadership of the
state's education agencies, and your
support for Georgia Match makes this one
of the most successful and largest
direct admission programs in the
country. Georgia Match reduces barriers,
simplifies the transition from high
school to post-secary, and sends a clear
message to students. There's a place for
you in Georgia's education system.
For those of you who have not had a high
school senior in your home recently, I
did just want to share a quick copy of
what the letter looks like. Of course,
it shows not only uh which institutions
the students automatically meet
admissions requirements, but we also
include information about financial aid
and trying to start that conversation
early. And I could just uh you know ask
you to imagine for a moment when you
were thinking about what to do after
high school, what if you had received a
personalized letter from the governor
telling you where you automatically are
eligible for admission and just what a
game changer this is taking the fear and
anxiety out of the college application
process.
As you've been hearing from the governor
and other state agencies today, uh the
top state for talent initiative unifies
our approach to education. Through
Governor Kemp's leadership, we are now
collaborated to an unprecedented degree
with the governor's education and
workforce strategy team. This is the
group where that collaboration happens.
It is made up of the agency leaders from
the Department of Education to the
Department of Labor and all of us in
between who helped develop the talent
pipeline, the Technical College System
of Georgia, the University System of
Georgia, the Governor's Office of
Student Achievement, and the Georgia
Student Finance Commission. Because of
our role in implementing the Georgia
Match program, we have an opportunity to
represent students and families in
conversations about the best way to plug
them into the state's workforce.
The governor's workforce summit this
past October at the World Congress
Center drew more than a thousand
business, education, and government
leaders in attendance.
We had the opportunity to introduce that
impressive audience to three students
who benefited from GSFC programs. West
Georgia Technical College student Reagan
Bearden and Valdasta State University
student Abigail Gilbert shared firsthand
how Georgia Match helped them claim
their spot and continue their academic
journey toward high demand careers in
healthcare.
Student Jeffrey Lowe studied at both
Georgia Pedmont Technical College and
Georgia State University as he prepares
for a career in the music management
business. The Hope Grant and the Hope
Scholarship made college possible for
him. These students are just three
examples of how the Georgia Student
Finance Commission is participating in
the shared effort to make sure Georgia
continues to be the top state for
talent. And I could say thank you again
for your support of House Bill 192 last
year. this was the top state for talent
act. Uh this new law calls on high
school students to create that GA
futures account beginning in nth grade.
Um and so to help facilitate that, we've
developed a new module in GA futures so
that high school counselors can see uh
the students progress with doing this as
well as offer personalized assistance.
Uh Mr. Mr. Chairman, the career
navigator, the last bullet point on the
screen. I I know this is not in GSFC's
budget, but if I could add my voice and
ask for the committee's favorable
consideration of this recommendation in
the Office of Student Achievement
budget. So much of what we do is trying
to get the best information to high
school students quickly so they can make
those plans for after high school
whether it's military workforce
post-secary and the development uh this
governor recommendation for a career
navigator stands to be a gamecher for
our students.
Uh as you all know uh our agency
operates a team of outreach
representatives across the state. Uh I
like to think of these heroes as our
recruitment team to make sure that
talent stays in Georgia. Uh these
dedicated professionals are the main
point of contact for us in your high
schools. Um and so throughout the year
they're providing workshops and
in-person trainings to help students and
parents begin thinking about college
plans. Uh as I mentioned last year they
met with nearly 92,000 students at over
1,600 events. And so if you're ever
interested in hosting an event in your
area, uh please call on me and we'd be
glad to connect you with your outreach
representative.
When I assumed this position last
spring, I challenged my team to focus on
three topics. How to better serve
students, to be known for exceptional
customer service, and to promote
financial literacy. Uh I know in my
relationship with many of you for so
long that part of our mission in
providing access to education is also
making sure that Georgians are making
smart financial decisions. And so I'm
proud that this year we'll be launching
an enhanced portion of our website uh
just in time for financial literacy
month in April. Uh responsible borrowing
can provide access to post-secary
education and we want families to be
equipped to navigate that process in a
way that sets students up for future
success. Um educating them about the
best career choices for their interests,
talents, and financial needs goes
handinhand with identifying scholarships
and grants to help them pay for a
meaningful credential.
Uh, financial literacy also complements
our aid programs by helping students
make informed decisions about budgeting,
borrowing, and completion.
Uh, those of you with high school
seniors or college students know about
the FASA. And like most Americans, you
probably have some choice words to
describe your experience with this form.
Uh, but the FASA or the free application
for federal student aid is the gateway
to free financial aid. and supporting
FASA completion is one of the most
cost-effective strategies we have to
increase access to federal financial aid
for Georgia students. Uh we're very
pleased that because of GSFC outreach
and marketing efforts alongside those
financial literacy resources, Georgia
increased our FASA completion rate in
fiscal year 25 and we continue to rank
above the national average.
Pictured here is one of our FASA
completion events uh at Collins Hill
High School in Gwynette County. Uh, I
think these students are smiling because
we're helping them get through that
FASA. And so, uh, simply put, every
additional FASA completed represents
federal dollars coming into Georgia at
no additional cost to the state. And
this is a clear example of how targeted
outreach can leverage significant
external resources.
Mr. Chairman, before I dive into our
budget numbers, I want to shift briefly
and highlight some of our financial aid
programs that you all have invested in
recently. Uh so with a maximum award of
$2,500, the Georgia College completion
grant targets students who are otherwise
on track to graduate and the goal is
simple, to prevent small financial
obstacles from becoming permanent
dropouts. Uh this program has been
tremendously successful in helping
students get across the finish line,
earn their credential, and join the
workforce. During the last legislative
session, you all expanded this program
uh to help students when they have just
that relatively small gap between what
they owe and what they can pay for their
education. Uh that was House Bill 38
during the 2025 session.
Since the program began in 2023, we have
made more than 28,000 awards to students
totaling more than $32 million. uh grant
awards are based on program requirements
and are available uh allocated funds at
the institutions. This is at USG, TCSG
and uh nonprofit independent colleges.
And so thank you again for your support
of House Bill 38.
Another program we are proud to
administer is the Reach Georgia
scholarship. REACH is a statewide
need-based aid program launched by
Governor Deal in 2012.
Uh, REACH is unique and that is a public
and private partnership. So, the
generous appropriations that you provide
make up $9,000 of each $10,000
scholarship and then local school
systems raise the remaining $1,000 uh to
complete that student scholarship.
Students must meet program requirements
related to academic achievement,
behavior, and attendance to be eligible
uh for that college scholarship. And uh
you know, one of my favorite things
about this program are these signing
ceremonies in the fall. I had the
opportunity to attend a reach signing
ceremony in Carol County uh along with
our commissioner, Linda Mcuarter. The
these are so much fun because the
students are there with their commitment
papers and their parents and it feels
just like a collegiate uh athletic
signing ceremony. Just so much positive
energy in the room. And so, um, if you'd
like to become more involved, um, in
your local school system, please get in
touch with me and we'd love to connect
you with your local REACH coordinator.
The newest program we are privileged to
administer is the Georgia Promise
Scholarship, an education savings
program enacted by the General Assembly
during the 2024 legislative session.
You all gave us one year to build this
new program and develop the
infrastructure so that we be could begin
awarding funds for the first time this
past summer. The Georgia Promise
Scholarship is for eligible families
enrolling in private schools or
participating in a course of home study.
In FY26, the scholarship award amount
was $6,500.
In this first year, we have over 7,700
students participating in this inaugural
cohort. Of those, three out of four
students come from families below 400%
of the federal poverty line threshold.
We had an outstanding fall semester and
continue to learn from our experience as
well as other states who have
implemented educational choice programs.
Thanks to your diligent focus while
creating this legislation two years ago,
all of the scholarship funds that are
dispersed to families must be utilized
within a secure closed marketplace. This
robust vetting of schools and vendors
helps ensure funds are only spent on
qualified education expenses.
This slide shows how Promise scholarship
funds are being used by eligible
students. As you can see, over 70% of
expenditures support tuition and fees
with the remainder covering other
qualified educational services. This
breakdown demonstrates that funds are
being used as intended within statutory
guidelines.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know today's
presentation is supposed to be about the
numbers, but we mentioned earlier how
every Georgian has a hope story and
we're starting to collect promise
stories, and I felt like I would be
remiss if I didn't share some of the
feedback we have received on this new
program. The message on this slide comes
to me from a mother of a Georgia student
with special needs. Since launching this
new program, the families who have
received promise have underscored for me
and my staff at GSFC that two things can
indeed be true at the same time. Georgia
is blessed with outstanding public
schools and there are times when
families have extenduating circumstances
and need another choice. The Georgia
Promise Scholarship gives them that
opportunity and we're grateful for your
support of this program.
Turning now to the budget. The
governor's amended fiscal year 26
recommendation supports the continued
administration and oversight of these
programs. You can find GSFCs in section
44 of your track sheets. The first item
is 44.2.1
in commission administration. This
change of 245,000 is the governor's
recommendation for the one-time $2,000
supplement for our employees. The next
item is 44.3.1
in dual enrollment. This change reflects
the governor's recommendation of an
additional 18.5 million to meet the
projected need.
Next is 44.4.1
which is a reduction of 160,000 in the
engineer scholarship. This item reflects
a one-time trueup request from Mercer
University based on the actual number of
awards made in FY26.
Next is 44.5.1
in Georgia Military College Scholarship.
Uh to meet the projected need, the
governor is recommending an additional
440,000 to serve those students.
The next item is 44.9.1 in Hope
Scholarships private schools. This
recommendation is to increase funds by
927,000 to meet the projected need to
accommodate the projected growth and
awards.
If you'll turn to the next page in your
track sheet, we'll discuss item 44.10.1
in Hope Scholarship Public Schools. The
governor is recommending an increase of
11.3 million to meet the projected need.
Our next item is 44.12.1
in North Georgia Military Scholarship
Grants. Like uh the increases at Georgia
Military College, uh to meet the
projected need, the governor is
recommending an additional 555,000
Next is 44.14.1
in promise scholarship. The governor is
recommending a one-time reduction of 86
million. Again, this is a one-time
reduction that represents a program
trueup based on the actual number of
participating students we saw in the
first year. The final item for GSFC is
44.18.1
in tuition equalization grants. Uh this
item is a yes caption directing the
agency to utilize program reserves to
meet the projected need.
Uh lastly, committee members, I'll
mention 44.19.1
for INPEC. Uh the Georgia nonpublic
postsecary education commission is
administratively attached to GSFC. Uh
their executive director, Dr. Cook Kirk
Shook, is here and we'll be happy to
answer any questions you have. but uh
their item reflects the governor's
recommendation for the $2,000 onetime
supplement.
And so now we turn our focus to the
governor's budget recommendations for
fiscal year 2027. Once again, you can
find us in section 44. Uh the first item
is 44.1
in college completion grants. Uh
governor is recommending an additional 1
million for TCSG students specifically.
Uh this increase is related again to
that House Bill 38 that you all
supported during the last session uh
increasing eligibility for TCSG
students.
The next items are in commission
administration 44.2.1
through 44.2.4.
Uh these items are the same statewide
changes my colleagues have mentioned
before me, so I won't spend too much
time here. Uh the total change
recommended by the governor is a
reduction of 475,000.
The next item is 44.3.1
in dual enrollment. Uh like the amended
budget, the governor here is
recommending an additional 27.6 million
to meet the projected need.
Next is 44.5.1
in the foster care scholarship. Uh and
if I could say thank you so much to all
of you who have been working on this
issue tirelessly uh for so many years.
Uh very proud to partner with you all to
implement this new program. Uh the
governor is recommending an initial
initial funding level of $2.5 million
for FY2027.
Next is 44.6.1
in Georgia Military College scholarship.
Uh to continue fully funding this
program, the governor is recommending an
additional 756,000.
Next on 44.10.1 10.1 in hope
scholarships uh private schools. The
governor's recommendation for FY27
uh fully incorporates uh the hope award
equalization item that you all have been
working on and the total recommended for
these changes is 3.2 million.
The ne next item is 44.11.1
and hope scholarships public schools.
The governor is recommending an
additional 55 million for hope public
and FY27 to meet the projected need.
Next is 44.13.1
in North Georgia Military Scholarship.
To continue fully funding the program,
the governor is recommending an
additional 672,000.
And if you turn the page one last time,
you'll see 44.19.1
in tuition equalization grant. Um to
accommodate the continued growth in this
program, the governor is recommending an
additional four million in state funds.
And then the final item is our attached
agency INPEC. Items 44.20.1
and 44.20.2
reflect the relevant statewide changes
for a reduction totaling 53,000.
Uh colleagues, thank you for the
opportunity to present the governor's
budget recommendations for the Georgia
Student Finance Commission today. Um,
and thank you for your support of these
programs and of Georgia students. Be
happy to answer any questions.
>> Senator Burns, is that did you not have
a question? Wave. Uh, Senator Oric.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
appreciate your presentation today and
your uh leadership as you're getting uh
uh deeper and deeper into your uh fairly
new uh tenure uh as this commissioner.
Uh I would the the uh match grants. Do
you have the numbers? You know, we that
this is a relatively new program that's
been very received very well and and
very successful. And are are we able to
get some numbers now on that? uh slice
of students that never respond after
they get the letter. That may be where
we're going to be finding the the folks
that will now benefit from this uh new
uh needs-based uh uh funding that uh is
recommended in the governor's budget.
>> Uh Senator, thank you for the question.
One of the graphics I wish I had to
share with you all uh the office of
student achievement puts out a pie chart
showing what happens to our students
after high school graduation. And uh you
know we can see the percentage that
stays in state, we can see the
percentage that goes out of state, we
can see the percentage that enters the
workforce, but there is a significant
portion of that pie chart where we have
no idea what happens to our students
after high school graduation. We
absolutely think that Georgia match will
continue to be a gamecher. And so the
next time we uh see my colleagues from
the office of student achievement, I'll
ask them about the latest pie chart to
see if we have moved the needle on those
students who didn't think college was
possible for them. And I hope what
you've heard from Commissioner Doer and
Chancellor Purdue, uh, you know, both of
their enrollments are up. And so, uh,
just really proud of the impact that
Georgia Match continues to make. Yes,
ma'am.
Well, thank you for testifying to the
committee when we were looking at the
needs-based uh options that are are now
appearing in our budget. Thank you so
much. Yes, ma'am.
>> Leader Hughley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so
much for your presentation. Uh can you
give us a number of completion grants
that you had this past year?
>> Yes, ma'am. And while I'm looking for my
data point, I'll tell you um the agency
produces three annual reports. Uh one on
dual enrollment, one on college
completion grant, and one on STEM
waiting for the hope scholarship. And so
we just published those in December. And
later today, I'll be sure that you get
that. Um for college completion grant,
uh we have awarded
uh more than 28,000 awards. And the
reason I say awards and the reason uh we
use awards when we're making projections
oftent times a student may receive an
award in the fall and an award in the
spring. And what's so neat about the
completion grant and what you all were
doing was uh focusing on completion. So
if we know that a student needs just a
little extra financial help to get them
across that finish line, that's where
these have been targeted. Um and thank
you. I can't say enough about our
partner institutions. Uh the uh
professional staff in the financial aid
offices at these institutions are really
what makes this possible. They have the
relationships with the students and can
tell us uh who needs that additional
help.
>> One other one, Mr. Chair, uh can you
tell me or how do you anticipate the
dream scholarship to coordinate with the
college completion?
>> Yes, ma'am. So, you know, I think we
have multiple tools in the toolkit. My
understanding from the vision with the
dream scholarship is that uh that will
be perhaps geared more towards access.
So, with students that need some
additional help starting their college
journey and then if we can blend fund
sources and we can support them with the
completion grant towards the end of
their high school, excuse me, college
experience. Um, and so I know as a
former employee of the university
system, all of those colleagues are
laser focused on student success and
anything that we can do to support the
success of the dream scholarship. Uh,
what an honor to be the state of hope
and dreams.
I
>> think that all your questions. We do
want to point out a few things though.
President Green, it's your first time
being here. Hope you enjoyed it.
Thank you for the information. And your
predecessors obviously in the back.
President Riley, thank you. Commissioner
Riley in the past. Thank you for your
years of service, not only there, but
also to Fulton County and the House of
Representatives. We're so glad you're
here. One last question, though, before
you're gone. Uh, you mentioned uh on one
of your previous slides, you had a I
think her name was Reagan Bearden.
>> Yes.
>> Do you think she gets her intelligence,
she was one of your people you had
speak, you think she gets her
intelligence from her mother or her
father? This might be the most difficult
question you answer today. And do
remember that one of them is an
appropriator.
Uh, I'm so grateful for the Bearden
family for being such champions of the
Georgia match program and it's been a
joy working uh with Reagan.
Thank you, President Green. I hope you
have a good afternoon.
Next up is
Commissioner Amy Jacobs with Department
of Early Learning
Care.
>> Hey, um just so everybody knows, all the
presentations today will be online
or probably some of them are already um
but will be done by the end of the day
on our legislative site under the House
budget research tab.
All right, turn it over.
>> Okay, thank you. Well, good afternoon,
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. I know you all have had a
very long day, so thank you for sticking
around and hearing about uh the state of
child care in our state. uh we know how
important it is for working families,
for young children, and of course for
the local and state economy to have
access to high quality early learning.
So over the last five years, we have
seen a modest increase in our licensed
capacity. We've actually seen an
increase in our childcare learning s
centers of about 4%. We have seen a
decrease in our family childcare
learning homes. These are smaller
learning environments that care for six
or less children. Uh and that's a
nationwide issue uh that nationally
we're trying to figure out, but overall
license capacity uh has increased by 6%
over the last five years. So as we end
uh June of 2025, Georgia had over 3,200
licensed childcare centers, over a
thousand family child care homes, and
387,000
total licensed capacity for children
birth to five. And of course, uh, Decal
licensed and monitors each of these
programs to make sure they're meeting
health and safety standards. So, our
child care and parent services program
or CAPS is one of our largest and
probably most impactful programs. This
is Georgia's childare subsidy program
that provides scholarships for working
families so that they can send uh their
children to high quality early learning
while they either work or attend school.
this uh this program were able to serve
51,000 children. Uh this is a large
budget, so I'm going to point it out
specifically. It's $385 million made up
of both federal CCDF dollars and state
general funds. In Georgia, we are very
fortunate to have a very robust quality
rated system. So this is our system that
determines, improves, and communicates
the quality of early learning in
Georgia. We have about 2900 child care
programs that have received a one, two,
or three star rating. 98% of children in
our CAPS program a 10 a quality rated
provider. And I point that out because
we know that high quality early learning
is good for all young children, but it's
really really impactful for children
with low incomes and quality. We have
quality rated programs in 154 of our
counties throughout our state. I know
you're all very familiar with Georgia's
prek program, which remains a national
leader when you look at quality and
access. Since 1992, Georgia PreK has
served over two million children, and we
know from research that it prepares kids
for kindergarten. This school year, uh,
Georgia PreK is serving over 68,000
four-year-olds. We were able to provide
over 138 new classrooms. Over 70% of our
classrooms have more than 18 students
and we've been able to reduce the rate
weight list um from last year to 3,300.
If you will remember back in FY25, you
supported a historic investment in
Georgia PreK of over $97 million. So I
wanted to touch on uh some of those
successes. So uh we are in the second
year of a class size reduction. Uh we
were serving 22 students. Now we have
class size of 20. So that's allowed us
to add over 300 new classrooms all
throughout the state over the last two
years. And we know smaller class sizes
are better for young kids. Uh this
investment also allowed us to do teacher
pay parody with our K12 colleagues. Our
lead teachers uh received a 13% increase
because of this and our assistant
teachers received a 27% increase. Better
than that in my opinion is what we're
seeing in teacher retention. Due to
these increases, we retained about 82%
of our lead teachers last year and 77%
of our assistant teachers, and that has
increased since this investment was made
two years ago. This investment has also
allowed us to increase our startup
grants for new classrooms. Again, we
funded 319 new classrooms, which was a
$9.6 million investment. We also provide
refurbish refurbishment grants for
continuation classrooms. We've done that
for over 1500 classrooms over the last
two years. Operation funding has
increased by 27% and for transportation
9% increase in sites that are actually
providing transportation which we know
sometimes can be a barrier to attending
Georgia PreK.
You may remember Georgia's preK also has
a summer transition program. We operate
two models in the summer for five weeks.
Uh one is our rising prek and this is
for children that are Spanish speaking
or children with disabilities that we
know need a little extra support before
they even enter preK. So, we offer that
five weeks before they start their pre-K
year. We also offer rising kindergarten
because there are students that are
identified as needing additional
support. Maybe they came in late during
the year. Uh maybe they have been
identified by their teacher as needing
extra support. So, we provide them with
five weeks after pre-K before they enter
kindergarten. This is a smaller program,
but it is part of our prek program. It
is funded with lottery dollars. Our
rising prek program, we have 69
classrooms and our rising kindergarten,
326.
We also operate two nutrition programs.
We know how important food is for young
kids. We offer we administer the child
and adult care food program, which is
CACFP,
uh which allows us to reimburse for 65.7
meals throughout our state in 157
counties. And we also offer a summer
food program which is Happy Helpings uh
which reimbures for meals for nonprofits
to serve meals during the summer when
kids school age kids do not have access
to meals. This last summer they served
2.9 million meals in 109 counties.
So I'm going to move on uh to our
budget, but I always like to show uh our
fund source split. We are heavily funded
by federal funds. 48.7%
comes from federal funds, which are two
federal funding sources. CCDF childcare
development fund in USDA. We receive uh
over 45% from the state lottery to fund
our Georgia prek program and 6.2% of
state general funds. All of which goes
to our subsidy program.
So, uh this is real quick. We don't have
any changes the amended, but I did want
to acknowledge the $2,000 supplement uh
that the governor added for all state
employees and for prek lead and
assistant teachers. I know our team is
very appreciative of that. And then for
FY2027 for the governor's budget
recommendation, our changes are all in
the preK program. So all lottery
dollars. This is page 165. Uh number six
is a actual decrease in $125,000.
As as I said, um our teacher on the T&
schedule just like K12 teachers and this
is just how it ended up this year. So
there's a slight reduction of $125,000.
Uh number seven is an increase in the
per member per month SHBP increase. We
have about 50% of our classrooms are in
public schools. So they are part of
SHBP. And this is to reflect that
increase an increase from 1885 to 2028.
So an addition of $5.8 million that will
go directly to those school systems to
pay those SHP bills. And then number
eight, we are in our third year of a
four-year phase in of reducing our class
size. So, we asked for four years to do
that because we knew we would need to
add 400 classrooms to reduce the class
size to 20. So, this is an additional
$12 million to add an additional 100
classes next year.
So, that was um I tried to be brief. I
know you've been here a long time, but
cover it all. So, I'm happy to answer
any questions.
>> Thank you. Uh director, I have my first
question is this. if you don't mind
taking a minute. One of the questions
we've got a lot is, of course, the
issues that are going on in Minnesota
relating to child care facilities.
Obviously, we feel like we're in a lot
better position in Georgia. You spent
much of your December talking to us
through that. But if you would, for the
sake of edification for the other
members who maybe did not get that
information, let them know why. We at
least feel like George is in a much
better position.
>> Absolutely. Um, so we believe we have
several levels of safeguards to prevent
uh fraud and to detect fraud. When we
think about sending money out the door,
especially as it relates to our
childcare subsidy program or our CAPS
program, our first level of defense is
our childcare licensing staff. They
visit licensed programs a minimum of two
times a year unannounced. Also, when we
grant a new license, we actually visit
the center and make sure or the family
childcare home and make sure that they
are up and operating. they have staff
hired. Um they have a director on board
who's done the training. So that's our
first level of defense. Um but we also
require providers to track attendance.
So they have to have a sign in sign out
sheet of a a parent or a guardian sign
those children in and out and then they
have to submit that attendance to us on
a weekly basis to be build. Then we have
a billing system in place which would
check for any type of irregularities.
For example, if a provider is billing
for more children than their actual
license capacity, or if a if a two
providers are billing for the same exact
child, our system would pick that up. We
would flag it. Uh our CAP staff would
work on that. But we also have a
dedicated audits and compliance division
that work on this on a regular basis.
So, of course, they take any type of
complaints. They would investigate, but
they also use a risk assessment model uh
to identify any programs that might need
a little extra attention from us. And
then anyone can can uh report fraud to
us through our website, through our
email, and then we have a 1-80088GA
tip line to uh report fraud.
>> Thank you. Just to summarize that up,
first we don't open up a facility unless
we personally visited it to begin with.
Second, we do two unannounced visits a
year. We even did those during COVID. We
also require signin signout sheets of
the parents before payments ever issued.
And we issue payments in a rears. That's
been something that's come up time and
time again of whether or not we should
issue payments on the front end for
child caring child care placing
agencies. We do it in a rears again as a
fight against fraud. I hope that helps
y'all understand that and provides you
with some ammunition when you're talking
back in your districts to to um your
constituents. Thank you for that.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Senator Sims,
>> thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you uh
Commissioner for your words of wisdom.
Georgia spends a lot of money on child
care. Uh that has a curriculum that
embraces
um an academic
um what do I want to say? An academic
aura that is not very challenging. Um
what are we going to do? Because when we
have these children in these classrooms,
that's a captive audience right there.
We can strengthen the literacy rates. We
can strengthen STEM. We can strengthen
anything. So by the time they get to
kindergarten,
they're prepared for learning. Okay. But
we still tend to have a curricula
that is very weak. What are we going to
do to embrace? That's number one. Number
two, and tell me about the pay
discrepancies between rural, urban,
metropolitan providers because I get a
lot of complaints from providers in my
district. Thank you.
>> So on your curriculum question, I will
say specifically for Georgia PreK, we
have a Georgia early learning and
development standards, which are
learning standards for birth to five
that align directly with our K12
standards. They were just updated to
match our K12 standards. They just did
an update around literacy and math, I
believe. And then we have a list of
approved curricula that match those. So,
I don't know that I would say our
curricula is is weak in Georgia. I'm
happy to talk more about specifically
what you mean by that because you
probably have better examples than I do,
but we go through a very rigorous
curricula
that meet all of the standards that we
would want to meet in Georgia PreK.
specifically
>> who's responsible for creating the
curricula? Is it uh do we have statewide
advisors or
>> So we go through a curricular review
about every five years and vendors
submit those to us. We usually have an
outside body. Sometimes it's the
University of North Carolina FPG which
is a leader in in reviewing things like
that. Sometimes it's the University of
Georgia. But we also have we always have
outside reviewers to make those
decisions on those approved list.
>> Thank you. Well, what we've done was we
spent a lot of money in education. I
want and I think all of us would like to
see a better return on the investments
that we make in education. We are
spending so much time on literacy
because our children can't read. We're
spending a lot of that. There's not only
and there's math literacy as well. If
the the earlier we begin with children
learning academically and not just play
play every day. I think the better we're
going to be.
>> I completely agree with you. I think the
earlier we start the better which is why
I'm proud that we have 2900 childare
programs that are quality rated. So we
know that those children that attend
those programs are experiencing that
high quality learning environment which
is the crucial part for brain
development. Your second question was
about different rates in different parts
of um the state. So, we do have
different rates for our cap subsidy. I
think that might be what you're
referring to. And that's based on a
market rate study that we do every two
to three years. We're required to do
that. It basically looks at all of the
cost um all around the state and we set
those rates based on that. So, that's
based on rates we collect throughout the
state.
>> Excuse me. One more thing,
>> Mr. Spe Mr. Chair,
>> last time. Okay. Do you mind if I speak
with you about the provider pay because
it is really a problem?
>> Absolutely.
>> Without our providers being able to stay
competitive.
>> Absolutely.
>> Thank you,
>> Chair Lady Dempsey,
>> Mr. Jacobs. Yes. I just want to say
thank you. And sort of along the lines,
I think of what Senator Sims was trying
to say is um the way I see it is that
y'all are doing an incredible job.
you're doing much with little at times
for little people. There has been a long
um thought process that much of this is
taken care of in home or in other places
but in today's world most of our parents
need to work must work so those children
are left for hours without the brain
development that is so crucial at that
time. I would say that I hope you can
continue to do the curriculum and the
work you are doing and that we can
continue to find ways to invest earlier
and earlier and increase the number and
the capacity I would say so that we are
addressing the literacy rate at the time
that is most crucial from
>> really pre-birth until five.
>> Yes, I agree. Thank you,
>> Leader Heagley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
for your presentation. Um, along those
lines, do you have uh any idea and your
thoughts or dreams of when we will be
able to get to three-year-old prek in
this state?
Uh, and we have a great track record
with four-year-old prek. And so whenever
the investment is there, we're ready to
go. Um I do think a small way that we
could look at that, which is not as
expensive as a universal 3K program, is
our rising prek program, which is for
three-year-olds. It's five weeks during
the summer, but at least it gets five
weeks before you start pre-K. Because
what our research shows us is that those
children who come in with low language,
meaning children from poverty, dual
language learners, or with disabilities,
they're coming in behind their peers.
That's why we start five weeks early
with our rising prek program. They make
huge gains during that pre-k year, but
they're still leaving behind their
peers. So, if we can get them earlier
and earlier, I'm in full support of
that. And I think we have the track
record to do a successful program.
>> One last thing.
Can you tell us what the impact of the
federal budget is having on your budget?
>> Yes. So, uh, a couple things. There was
obviously a federal government shutdown
uh that we went through. Thankfully, we
were still able to uh access our funding
system. So, we were still able to draw
down our federal dollars. So, there was
no interruption any in any of our
payments. Most recently, uh the federal
government did enact what they call
defend the spend. Uh, so we're required
to provide additional justification when
we ask for our weekly draw downs from
the feds, but our finance staff has been
able to provide that level of detail in
a thousand words or less, and we've been
able to get our funds on time. So,
there's been no delay of payments for
there.
>> Representative Glaze,
>> thank you so much for this wonderful
presentation. As you know, our children
are the best of what we have to offer
this world. And so what I'm concerned
about is um expanding the four-year-old
so that there is no four-year-old left
behind in Georgia trying to get in the
program. We still have many. Speak to
that. And also tell me a little bit of
where and how we choose rising prek,
where it's located, and then the rising
kindergarten. How do we know how many
there are and where to locate?
>> So, let me start with your last
question. So, Rising PreK is an
application process and we work with
existing preK providers and they're able
to identify those children that are
already identified to enroll in their
pre-K program in the fall with those
type of demographics that I talked to
you about. So, it's a very based on the
funding, that's how we identify them.
Same with our rising kindergarten. We
work directly with programs that have
the need for children to attend an
additional five uh weeks after
kindergarten. I'm happy to get you a
list of those. It's not as widespread as
um prek, but I'm happy to get you a list
of those. There has been an expansion
over the last few years. And you talked
about four-year-olds. So, um we are
seeing a decrease in our enrollment in
four-year-olds. Um it sounds like that's
what they're seeing in K through 12. Uh
that's what they're seeing nationally.
Part of that is a decline in birth at
five population in Georgia. We we've
tracked that and it's down over 1%. I
think that's part of it. Uh I think
families are using prek differently. I
think some folks are maybe staying at
home. So what we're doing is looking at
any type of barrier. PreK is free, but
there are a couple costs. Uh they can
charge for meals, especially if they're
in a childcare center that doesn't have
a food program. And then of course it's
a school day so there's before and after
care cost uh that could be there for
working families as well. So we're
looking at those barriers. We're also
going to increase our marketing. We've
never had to do marketing for Georgia
PreK. Uh so we're going to increase our
marketing and uh we have just contracted
with the Carl Vincent Institute of
Government at UG to do an even bigger
study. So we can actually ask the
parents that are not attending Georgia
PreK why to see if we can um address any
of those issues. So, a couple things in
the works.
>> Thank you, Commissioner Jason Jacobs.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> All right. Chairman Tiller, you want to
hand over that?
>> I can.
Next, we're heading over into a little
different area. Our Chief Justice Nells
Peterson, Georgia Supreme Court. It
looks like he's bringing somebody for
backup there with him.
work.
>> Justice Peterson, we we didn't start the
increase for judicial safety yet, but I
do see you've uh you've chosen on your
own. Judge Chief Judge Brown, it's nice
to see you. Thank you for joining.
>> We got you turned on. Go ahead.
>> Well, thank you very much. Thank you,
uh, Chairman, uh, members of the
committee. Appreciate the opportunity to
be here. I know you're running uh behind
and so I will try to hit the high points
um and obviously we'll answer whatever
questions y'all may have. Um the court
of appeals and and the Supreme Court
have worked really closely together uh
in arriving at these budget requests to
try and be as aligned as possible. Um
our budgets are fairly simple. Uh and so
there are two kind of key policy issues
that both of our budget requests share
and we thought it would be a good idea
for me just to start by talking about
those two policy issues before we go
into the budget specifics. And the first
is security. Um
there is a critical security gap for the
appellet courts, the statewide courts
that needs to be closed. Um and the
threat environment over the last uh few
years has really changed. The threat
environment used to be focused on
courthouse security. Think to the Brian
Nichols case for example. But the
incidents that we have seen the last
several years and there have been far
too many of them including one yesterday
in Indiana where an Indiana judge and
his wife were shot through his front
door. um have all been at home and so
the security environment and the threats
that we are looking at that the system
needs to be able to address are
different and require different
approaches. Um almost every trial court
judge in this state has a local law
enforcement agency that is responsible
uh for providing security when necessary
for for local judges um including
superior court judges who are state
judges just at you know for the the
local circuit. Um, but there are 25
state judges who do not have a law
enforcement agency responsible for their
security outside of the courthouse. The
eight justices of the Supreme Court who
are not the chief, the 15 judges of the
court of appeals, and then the judges of
the statewide business court and the new
tax court. The Georgia State Patrol does
and continues to do a terrific job of
protecting the Nathan Deal Judicial
Center. Uh, and their executive
protection division has done and I have
recently learned continues to do a great
job of protecting the Chief Justice.
But it is not the State Patrol's
responsibility to provide general
protection for any of the other
statewide judges, nor do they have the
resources to do it. During Chief Judge
Bogs's tenure, uh, a new judicial
council standing committee on judicial
security was created. Uh, that's led by
Justice Sean Ellen Lrua and Court of
Appeals Judge Brian Rickman. And that
committee had a team of high level law
enforcement and security experts review
security for the statewide courts. And
that that team's conclusion was that
serious gaps existed and needed to be
closed.
As part of addressing that conclusion,
we used existing funds to contract with
Stan Cooper from the Department of
Corrections in the back. Many of you all
know him. Um, a longtime security expert
with the Department of Corrections. And
with substantial support from the
Department of Corrections, Stan has been
working and has done great work to help
address those gaps. Uh, but he is
retiring from corrections, which is
brought an end to to their uh their
assistance with that. I am very grateful
to the commitment the Department of
Corrections has had and the support they
have offered. So that's problem number
one. Problem number two is for as far as
I can tell for the history of Georgia,
there has been no statewide coordination
or data collection for judicial security
issues across Georgia's 1600 judges. On
the federal level, the US Marshall
Service tracks very closely threats
against federal judges. uh over 500
threats against federal judges in FY25,
but we have had no statewide tracking or
coordination of those sorts of issues on
the state and local level. Um much less
coordination on things like training and
best practices, um identification of
resources across jurisdictions. And so
part of what Stan has also been doing
has been establishing a a threat
tracking process for the judges. Um and
along with Justice Lagura, Judge Rickman
and wonderful state law enforcement
partners, especially at GIPstick,
coordinating statewide training and
identifying and establishing best
practices across the state and across
all the classes of court. These
functions have been sorely needed and
are making an enormous difference across
the state already. But Stan's role has
been as a temporary contractor. um we
need to make permanent his role as
director of judicial protection services
and provide that role the resources it
needs. So the budget requests you see in
both of our budgets are a coordinated
effort for the two courts to combine
their efforts to do that and to do it in
as efficient and as cost-effective a
manner as possible. The request is for
we have equal amount requests because
the plan is we will share the costs
equally but it's for two positions. the
director of judicial protective services
and then an operations coordinator.
There's a separate request just over
50,000 in each budget for a vehicle for
each. Those two positions are
principally about coordination, threat
assessment and mitigation uh training,
investigations, proactive policy work
and protection services. And many of
these functions will pay dividends not
just for the statewide courts but for
all of Georgia's 1600 judges. The other
part of the request is for a $100,000
fund from which in the event of a
specific threat that requires a security
presence for a judge or justice for a
limited period of time, the director can
hire offduty local law enforcement
officers to provide that security for
the time that it is needed. If you will,
this approach is really just the the
security equivalent of just in time
logistics.
It does not involve creating new law
enforcement positions beyond these two,
driving judges around in black SUVs, or
providing constant security for
statewide judges when it's not needed in
response to a specific credible threat.
But it does ensure that when, not if, a
credible threat comes, we have the
resources and protocols in place to
address this threat swiftly and
efficiently. And whatever part of that
$100,000 fund isn't needed for that
would be returned at the end of the
year.
That's the security pitch. And then the
second piece, um, which y'all have
already recognized is critically
important because you invested in it
last year, is is our crisis for staff
retention, particularly among staff
attorneys uh, at the two courts. And our
requests there are just to annualize
um, the six-mon salary increase that
that you funded last year. Uh but both
of our courts have experienced roughly
75% staff attorney turnover over the
last five to six years. That is
catastrophic for institutions like like
appellet courts. It is unsustainable and
it is it is new. It is not the historic
experience. Um and it really is critical
to retain those people who who are the
engine uh of the courts. Last year you
functioned you you funded two retention
initiatives for our courts. We're very
grateful for that. Um the lion share was
for salary enhancements for staff
attorneys and other critical
professional staff. Um
the FY26 budget made those enhancements
effective January 1st of this year. And
so the the FY27 budget just uh seeks to
annualize that. And also, um, if you do
decide to fund the governor's
recommendation of two $2,000 bonuses for
state employees, obviously we didn't
request that in our budget, and we would
we would ask that our staff get to
participate in that as well. Those are
the two big policy high points uh that
uh we were asked to touch on uh and I
have I am happy to go line by line
through the Supreme Court budget if you
would uh like that. I'm happy to We're
both happy to take questions at this
point. What would you prefer us to do?
>> If you'd hit the high points of the
budget, I don't need to know every line,
but
>> Sure.
>> Um, so in the amended budget, the only
request we have is a pass through from
DPS that that we do every year. Um, the
high points of the budget, um, there's a
604,000 $65,000
number there. Uh the majority of that is
annualizing
the increase in judicial uh compensation
that y'all very generously uh enacted
and funded last year. It was funded
effective January 1st and so we have to
annualize that judicial salary. The
remainder of that line is just the
annual request that we will make for a
salary increase up to the maximum
authorized amount that the salary model
contemplated in the statute
contemplates. Um, and that's entirely up
to to y'all's discretion as as are all
things uh in this space. Um, and other
than the security piece, that is the
high points of the of the Supreme
Court's budget.
>> Chief Judge Brand,
>> I don't know that I have any high
points. Welcome to field uh any
questions. Really, if you look at the
FY26, the amended budget, the only thing
that we asked for that's a larger ticket
item is the 197 197,000 where we're
transitioning from a uh a hardware
redundancy in our IT program and into
the cloud. Uh that's anticipated that
that will be a yearly expense, but
that's the first of that. Uh the 625 in
the amended budget is basically our
shared cost of the security director and
$40,000 not really a high point. We uh
our last judge required um commuting
fees. Um
like the chief justice said in the high
point is the salary increase. We're
looking to uh annualize not only the
judges and we certainly appreciate uh
the the salary enhancements that we
received last year. We are going through
a crisis. The numbers should shake you
to your core when you when you think
about the few people who are able to
serve as our very talented staff
attorneys. There's only few that are
able to do that and there's fewer still
that are willing to do that. and we're
losing them at a faster pace than we can
train them right now. Um, we don't
expect they don't expect to make the
money that they're going to make in
private practice. We just got to get a
little closer. A lot of what we're able
to offer uh to work with us as opposed
to private is starting to balance out
between us and the private sector.
There's even there's areas of the public
sector that we now compete with that
they're actually taking some of our
staff. Um
I don't there's really nothing else in
here unless there was a specific
question about anything on our budgets.
We again we appreciate the the salary
enhancements. We hope that you will
annualize those especially for our staff
and and staff attorneys.
Welcome answer any questions.
>> Chairman Gullet.
>> Thank you. Uh thanks for being here.
Thanks for what you do for our state. Um
the $40,000 commuting budget. Tell me a
little bit about that. I'm not familiar
with that.
>> So, uh the the judge that Judge Davis
replaced was a judge that worked within
the metro area. So, she did not have a
commuting budget. When he came on, he
does commute. So, we have to add to the
budget to replace or actually fill the
the need.
This is about $40,000 a year.
>> Every judge or justice, I'm assuming
this
>> outside of outside of 50 miles outside
of 50 miles were able to get per DM as
well as mileage once a week.
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> So that's $40,000
per judge that lives outside of 50
miles.
>> The way I understand it is that's the
maximum. If someone comes in every
potential day, 35 days, uh, per term,
three terms, a year, uh, plus mileage,
that it maxes out at about 40,000. And
that judge probably lives as far away as
you can.
So, most likely if he takes advantage of
all the days that it would be about
$40,000.
>> And so, in the amended, is it in the
amended you're asking for 40,000? So,
that's half a year. So, is it 80,000?
No. 40,000. Uh he came in January one,
>> right?
>> So that's for
>> six months,
>> right?
>> Well, we've had to pay it out as well.
>> Okay. But it's $40,000 annualized.
>> $40,000 annualized.
>> Do you know how many
>> I'm not hold you to it. How many live
outside the
>> Are we half
are we
probably seven or eight out of 15?
>> Okay. Thank you.
Chairman Carpenter,
>> is there a possibility to do like a line
item veto on a few of the judges that we
don't think near as highly of as the
others?
>> I thought you had a real question.
>> Been a long day, coach.
>> I wanted to start out with a motion to
recuse uh Chairman Carpenter, but I I
didn't.
>> Justice and judge, thank you. That's all
the questions. Appreciate y'all coming
today.
>> Thank you very much. Appreciate your
time and appreciate your commitment.
>> Members, we are done. We'll see you back
at 8 a.m. in the morning right here.
>> Casey's bringing breakfast.
Oh, and tomorrow, hey, uh the rural
caucus has invited us to lunch tomorrow.
U Mary Max. So, so keep that in mind in
the morning. We need to have plenty of
time for lunch when you're asking your
questions. Have a good night.
