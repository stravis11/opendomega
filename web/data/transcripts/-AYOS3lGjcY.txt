TRANSCRIPT
----------
all right good afternoon
everyone good afternoon and thank you
for all of you for being here my name is
Jason Estes the proud state senator from
Senate District 35 and I'm joined by my
colleagues in the house in the Senate
I'm joined by school board members by
parents and
students I'm joined by members of the
legislative black caucus by the Asian
caucus and the Hispanic
caucus here to talk about an issue that
impacts every community in Georgia our
public education system and how we fund
it this year marks the 40th anniversary
of the Georgia quality basic education
funding formula
QBE over those four decades the world
has changed dramatically but our funding
formula has barely evolved when QBE was
created there were no smartphones
no internet in classrooms and mental
health support for students was not even
a
conversation yet we continue funding
education as if time has stood
still this outdated approach has real
consequences schools struggle to meet
modern demands teachers who are already
not paid enough spend their own money
for supplies and in rural districts
across this state they face shrinking
budgets unless they raise money through
property
taxes as a former Middle School social
studies teacher I constantly found
myself thinking about how to remove
barriers for my
students this Antiquated funding formula
shouldn't be one of those barriers we
can't limit ourselves to providing a
quality basic
education our children deserve more our
children deserve an education that
prepares them for success and for the
future that's why I'm advocating today
for full revamp of the QBE formula to
meet the realities of
today but we also need to make an
immediate change Georgia is one of six
states that does not account for poverty
when funding schools we must move
quickly to change that teachers and
districts and low-income communities
across the state face unique challenges
and we must provide additional resources
through a poverty weight or an
opportunity Grant what increases the
urgency for change is the shifting
National Dynamic where federal education
funding is at risk es especially for
school districts with Title One schools
like many of the schools school
districts in this state with President
Trump and Elon Musk threatening to
dismantle the US Department of Education
Georgia must be proactive and take
control of our educational future
I am calling on my colleagues in the
state senate to adopt Senate Bill 128 to
add an opportunity grant that would
significantly benefit rural and urban
school districts across the state by
adding around $2 billion in funding for
educating students living and lowincome
communities there's a similar bill in
the house sponsored by my friend Phil
laer that my colleagues in the house
should pass as well regardless It is
Well passed time to modernize how we
invest in our children's future and give
every student regardless of their zip
code a real chance at success with that
I will now pass it to my friend
representative
alalia well good afternoon everyone I'm
representative Phil olalia it's a
pleasure to join you all here as my
colleague just mentioned the opportunity
waight and our uh Focus here to finally
after almost 40 years adjust our quality
basic education funding formula to get
desperate resources into the hands of
Educators and students is top of mind
and we don't have to go any further but
to think about what it feels like to be
a young person on an empty stomach
sitting in a classroom trying to learn
or a young person whose family uh has
uprooted three times in the span of one
school year because of rising uh house
prices I'm proud to have
introduced the Georgia Ed Educational
Opportunity Act a bipartisan bill which
would create an opportunity weight to
provide additional school funding for
students living in poverty as my
colleague Senator Estes mentioned we are
one of Six States let me repeat that one
of six states that currently does not
provide additional funding to support
students our children living in poverty
and as we all know poverty is the
greatest impediment the greatest barrier
standing in between our young people
their academic success and their
long-term
Futures the Georgia Educational
Opportunity Act gives every student
regardless of their background or their
family's financial situation the
opportunity to
thrive and our state's funding
formula was instituted and rolled out a
year after I was born which was quite
some time ago and I'm sure nobody here
is driving a 1986 Camry or
Volvo uh I would like to think that as
the times change uh so do our approaches
and our policies to meet the unique
needs that our students our Educators
and our families have
today and so this bill and we have uh a
current bill number it's 245 the Georgia
Educational Opportunity Act uh would
update that funding formula for the
first time and provide those local
school districts with additional
resources uh to lower those barriers uh
facing our young
people poverty impacts us all this is
not a Democrat or Republican issue it's
not uh a rural or Urban issue it's not a
black or white issue the opportunity
that this solution provides would
benefit all Georgians especially our
children there are almost 2 million
children prek through 12th grade who are
being educated in classrooms across the
state almost half a million our children
live living at or below the poverty
line and so this weight would meet those
young people where they are it would
provide schools in rural Georgia for
example uh with additional resources to
transport students to dual enrollment
programs or provide wise Wi-Fi spot
Wi-Fi hotspots to Young Folks who lack
it for Suburban schools it would address
our growing Mental Health crisis and
support hiring additional counselors to
meet those needs
headon while urban districts would have
additional resources to pay for school
meal programs and provide critical
wraparound
services in my day job I run a local
nonprofit that works in our local uh
tital one high schools and I see
firsthand the benefits that come from
having additional resources to meet our
young people where they are and lower
barriers to
opportunity and so I'm proud uh to be in
lock step with my colleagues pushing
this effort forward in the
house and I'm hopeful that my Republican
colleagues are well are open uh to this
idea and this solution that is long
overdue and so thank you all for being
here I want to thank Senator Estes and
my colleagues for joining us I want to
thank the parents the Educators and the
students here today who are here to lend
their voice to this cause and I'd like
to pass it over to my colleague
representative long
Tran thank you rep representative Phil
it's my honor to be here as chair of the
API caucus my name is Long Tran uh state
representative for house District 80 and
I stand with my Representatives with my
colleagues from the house and the Senate
the cons the misconception of our API
Community is that we're all affluent and
we're all successful in the schools the
reality is we have demographics that are
struggling with poverty whether it's the
Vietnamese Farmers up in Gainesville or
the Filipino workers down in south
Georgia or the Cambodian Le ocean
families throughout Metro Atlanta and of
course the recent immigrant families up
along Buford Highway poverty is a
challenge that we have to address in
providing a poverty weight is a way to
equalize we C these students they look
at their peers and they see their peers
with parents who can provide them with
the latest tools latest tutoring systems
to give them a chance at achieving
academic success while these students
are left to try and pull themselves up
by bootstraps that they just frankly
don't have I was fortunate my parents
were refugees from Vietnam and we grew
up poor but I grew up in a school
district that adjusted for poverty that
understood why Blue Collar kid Blue
Collar children who were laid off from
plants like GM needed assistance to be
equal with their peers to find academic
success so for us to become competitive
as a state and not be among the worst in
the nation with academic outcome for us
to be competitive with New York and
California the successful States we must
address poverty by providing a weight a
poverty weight for our schools thank
[Applause]
you good afternoon everyone my name is
Senator Nikki marett I am the chair of
the Georgia legislative Black Caucus and
I am thrilled to stand in solidarity
today with our Tri caucus members of the
Hispanic caucus and the aapi caucus to
demand the long overdue Investments um
in our school and it's Investments that
our schools desperately need right now
and for decades our state has neglected
to update this funding formula and each
year we delay our students pay the price
you heard my colleague he I we are
supporting or I'm in support of Bill sb1
128 and we also have a house counterpart
of that bill HB HB
245 and we are here in Tri caucus
solidarity for both of those pieces of
legislation and to really highlight how
important this is no matter what
background you come from it's important
to those we represent in all of our
caucuses every every child in Georgia
deserves access to high quality
education from from all walks of life
but we know especially those areas that
are the most underserved and education
is the one tool that anyone in this
state can use to better their
circumstances better schools benefit
everyone in a community regardless of
age or economic status and research has
proven this time and time
again despite this our state once again
has dropped to the bottom of a list when
it comes to taking care of our students
why must Georgia be one of the last
States in this nation to prioritize the
well-being of our
children every year we see this same
status quo play out we still have not
updated the qbn
funding and each year that we do it we
fail thousands of Georgian CH children
when we have the solution right in front
of
us I will also remind everyone here that
most of these children are still dealing
with with the consequences caused by
educational disruptions related to the
pandemic and this is our chance to do
right by them in this moment in this
year by getting them the help that they
need for
Education we have a budget surplus of
over 16
billion yet we have not taken this
simple step to provide additional
support for children living in
poverty we we can't claim to be a
familyfriendly state in a bus in a state
that's number one in business when this
is the current state of affairs when it
comes to our
education we stand here today United on
this issue as do the vast majority of
Georgia residents our state leaders need
to understand the urgency of this moment
and pass this legislation this is
neither a democratic problem or a
republican problem
this is a state
problem and this is our opportunity to
show students who are our priority that
we are willing to invest in our state's
future and invest in them and with that
I'm going to bring on some from our
community uh we have some teachers and
students here today who would also like
to talk to you um first we're going to
have sh Bates she is a parent and uh
she's going to come up and speak to you
all thank you
[Applause]
hello as she said my name is Char Bates
I am a
mother a community advocate of over 14
years and the founder of breaking the
chains due to the poverty in
Georgia that has affected so many
students has led
us to teach teach Advocate and provide
for students in six different
counties providing everything from food
pantries to graduation fees for over 150
students to clothing
pantries many
times they may be afforded
opportunities but still can't afford the
attire to take advantage of the
opportunity because of their current
current Financial
State children don't ask to be born into
poverty that's not something that they
have a choice to be born
into
also many children are forced to provide
for their families before they even turn
18 many children are also at a place
where they're living with their
grandparents these grandparents are on
fixed incomes many times we have
provided food for
students and then turn around and the
family members and the parents or the
grandparents will then come back and ask
for food for the
families sometimes these are this is the
only food that they have over the
weekend it's a lot of kids the only
times that they eat is at
school it's hard to study when you don't
know where your next meal is coming
from
also poverty is also the root cause of
crimes and
literacy so by solving even a portion of
the poverty crime we also will be
decreasing the amount of crimes as well
as
illiteracy the fact that
Georgia is one of only Six
States but as a previous colleague said
that we claim to be a a family loving
State I mean it's kind of contradictory
the amount of money that we spend on
things that we don't really need but
it's all for show when we have students
in need and families that can be
provided for should be behind us after
this
year the fact of the matter is is that
we have an opportunity to change the
lives of these students we have an
opportunity to put them in a position to
win we have an
opportunity to change their future not
allow the financial state that they were
born into to determine their future so
we ask that you stand behind us we ask
that you
support we ask that you advocate for
those who can't advocate for themselves
thank
[Applause]
you good afternoon everyone um my name
is Rebecca maatu and I am currently a
second year public policy student at
Georgia
Tech I am also a product of Gat County
Public Schools and I owe so much of My
Success to the teachers counselors and
opportunities that shaped me but my
journey also showed me the cracks in the
system literally and
figuratively ultimately it is still a
system that like so many others is
stretch thin today I want to talk about
why fully funding public education is as
imp erative of an investment in our
Collective future this is about the
students who are being left behind and
the potential we are losing as a
state throughout my time in public
school I I made use of multiple
resources such as counseling and school
buses in order to bridge the gap between
Financial circumstances and
opportunities from sixth grade all
through high school I was heavily
reliant on school buses to get to school
my parents worked long hours and the bus
was practically my only option to get to
school every
day and for many students including
myself the school bus was the bridge
between home and opportunity without it
I wouldn't have been able to attend
school consistently and neither would
countless of other students across
Georgia along with that I was also
fortunate to attend a school where
counselors had the time and resources to
make a real difference my senior year of
high school school I found myself
visiting the counselor more often than I
ever had
before and she really helped me through
that college application process
building organizational habits and also
helping me become more mentally
resilient her guidance helped me
navigate my struggles and helped me
learn the valuable life lesson of
advocating for myself not only did her
support help me through a year of so
much
uncertainty but she also taught me how
to ask for help and believe in my own
ability to overcome
obstacles but even with reliable
transportation and exceptional guidance
counseling students can succeed in their
schools if their schools lack resources
they
need in Georgia funding inequities
between districts are Stark wealthier
districts can afford state-of-the-art
facilities and Cutting Edge technology
while poorer districts struggle to
provide basic necessities like updated
textbooks and safe buildings
during the covid-19 lockdowns my high
school completed construction on a new
facility designed to accommodate our
growing community and prevent
overcrowding this new addition was meant
to symbolize progress within our
community however after just one year of
returning to school and resuming
inperson learning I noticed something
alarming in the girls bathroom on the
second floor there was a large crack in
the wall spanning from the ceiling all
the way down and it made me wonder was
this building safe did it have the
proper funding it needed to ensure this
didn't
happen I had these concerns coming from
a relatively well-off public school
which begs the question what the
conditions must be like in lower income
school districts education should not be
a privilege determined by ZIP code and
we need Equitable funding to ensure
every student no matter where they live
has access to Quality
education so that's why I'm here today
to ask leaders to fully invest in our
public education system not only just
for the students of today but for the
future of our state we must invest more
and allocate our funds effectively so
every child can have proper access to
Safe schools reliable transportation and
guidance they need to
succeed we have the power to close the
gaps that hold students back and unlock
their potential to of an entire
generation this is about the child to
dream of being the first in their family
to go to college this is about the
teacher who spends their own money on
school supplies and this is about the
future of
Georgia as I close I stand here today as
living proof of what public education
can achieve when we choose to invest in
it but I also stand here as a reminder
of how much more we can do as a state so
let's not talk about change let's
actually make it happen
[Applause]
great
day I am cozy M Walker the 5th of the
Carver cluster listed as one of the
poorest poverty
lowincome and actually perfect for SB
284 also I'm a
Georgian and
I I would like the added weight so that
our families can be made whole in those
areas as well that
added like the Surplus that our governor
has and I believe in him so I believe
he's smart enough to know to look into
to see that we need that added weight
and anyone that's looking sees where
there's more education is better where
there's less education is worse over on
my side so I'm asking to help make our
students whole to give them the chance
to actually make it through to be
productive not be left behind and to be
Georgians proud families just like yours
Governor we want to look like you help
us and go ahead and add the extra weight
thank you thank
[Applause]
you and Jana will be our final
speaker
hi Georgia may be the number one state
to do business but it comes at the cost
of our most vulnerable communities young
Georgians like myself and our state's
refusal to provide specific funding to
educate children living in poverty as
one of only six states that fails to do
so I showed up here today because I am a
proud graduate of public schools in
Georgia I was born in Atlanta an
elementary school I attend in Cedar Hill
in gwet county and 3 years ago I
graduated from decar high school after
my family moved closer to my mom's job
at the Center for Disease Control next
year I will graduate from Georgia Tech
in my home county of dcab alone 18.2% of
residents live in poverty just below the
Statewide rate of
18.8% but 15 of Georgia's 159 Counties
have a poverty rate higher than the
state rate overall and recent data
suggests as many as
232 232,000 children across our state
live in high poverty areas Decades of
research confirmed that growing up in
poverty directly affects learning over
the last two decades it has become clear
that Georgia students who live in
poverty are being pushed further behind
their wealthier classmates compared to
students in other states the data is is
clear We are failing Georgia's children
no matter our background Faith or color
most of us believe that our future
depends on every child from every corner
of Georgia receiving a great education
while certain decision makers provide
handouts to the wealthiest few so many
neighborhood schools that nurture most
of our kids' dreams lie struggling to
make ends meet but while our work has
made America Prosper a greedy few have
rigged the rules to redirect resources
from our communities to their country
clubs from our classrooms to their
ballrooms and from our public parks to
their private jets now they stir fear
based on what we look like or where we
come from hoping that we'll blame
Everyday People for the hardship those
wealthy few create they hope to divide
and distract us so we don't join
together to demand that our shared
resources actually deliver the programs
schools and support that all of our
children need together we should demand
and we are demanding that our lawmakers
update Georgia's school funding formula
which is twice as old as I am and pass a
poverty weight so that every public
school provides every student with the
tools and unique resources we need to
learn grow and Thrive thank
you all right so we've heard from
students we've heard from parents and
we've heard from legislators doing the
work in this area and we hope that our
colleagues join us
in uh revamping the QB formula to
including an opportunity weight or an
opportunity Grant and we look forward to
those discussions with that I'll open up
to a few questions
well the fact that and we just heard the
student talk about 115 counties uh have
a significantly large uh population of
those in living in poverty uh the fact
that school districts have had to resort
to raising property taxes in order to
fill budget gaps and the fact that in my
experience as a teacher or uh as a
Schoolboard member I've seen how much
more it cost to educate uh and and care
for and support those who are living in
poverty we have school districts across
the state that have to provide
additional resources to to uh to
students and their families and it is
incumbent on us as a state to support
those school districts to reduce class
sizes to provide additional supports
like tutoring and counselors and mental
health supports uh to ensure that that
we can remove those barriers that we
often see in low-income communities
across the state so there are studies
that show that reducing the class size
uh would dramatically help with those
living in poverty unfortunately too many
school districts can't do that because
of those budget gaps that they
have yeah so the state right now is
actually not dedicating any money in the
QB formula to those living in poverty
and that's because we're one of six
states that does not account for poverty
when Distributing money to school
districts and that's what we are calling
to change uh with these with these
legislative bills my bill would would
add an additional $2 billion that would
go to school districts and be dedicated
to students living in poverty uh
representative Al I don't know if you
have a fiscal note same
way so so we're looking at roughly 2,000
per student um if you're uh using most
recent figure of half a million
uh students who will be eligible for
that weight it's it's a significant
amount of resources that we' be going
back into the hands of school districts
Educators and
children and when we think about going
back to to the
question from from before when we think
about reducing class sizes we have a
literacy crisis in the state where 60%
of our children at third grade are not
reading on grade level they're not
proficient in Reading in fourth grade we
should be doing what we can to reduce
class size sizes and a big start is to
infuse those resources into the State
education
budget no we we are asking for this to
be a
a permanent dedication of resources and
and make sure that moving forward
Georgia is a state that takes poverty
into account when it comes to educating
his
children uh yes there there are are a
few different ways free and reduced
lunch there's a there's several
different definitions of students living
in poverty but
it's mainly relies on free and reduced
lunch
classification uh well right now I'm
focused on this legislative session I'm
focused on addressing the issues that we
have before us and like I said the fact
that we have a literacy crisis in the
state that has gone uh
unaddressed I I think we need to move on
that now and I think by ensuring that we
include poverty as a consideration when
it comes to QBE we'll be making progress
towards that so I'm going focus on that
I'm going focus on my constituents in
fton and cob
County thank you all so much
