you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Representative Debbie Butler, Representative Butler. Thank you. Good morning colleagues. It is my pleasure and my honor to introduce our pastor of the day. He is a graduate of Mercer University, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and received his doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary. He is the 33rd pastor in the history of First Baptist Church of Columbus, a church that is as old as the city it serves. As a preacher's kid, one might observe that God had him in training all his life. As many of you experienced when you went to Columbus recently, he is welcoming. He is great at caring for his flock. He is thoughtful in his sermons, messages, and conversations. He is nurturing and involved in preparing for the future with programs such as Victory Mission, Second Story, and the Mercer Medical School in Columbus. He is also childlike, riding his bicycle and playing with children and youth at the monthly Bible studies at his home. A lifelong Georgia resident, a family man married to Roxanne, they have two sons, JC and John Christopher, and five grandchildren. This is the part you are going to want to listen to. There is a quote on the church website that made me think that we as representatives may be very similar to him. His quote is, I work six days a week to have the right to preach 20 minutes on Sunday morning. Now think about it. We work about 325 days out of the year trying to get or stay elected so we can get a bill passed in 40 days. Isn't that similar? Many of you know that Pastor Elder was Richard Schermann, Richard Smith's pastor. Some of you may not know, he also has the dubious distinction of being the pastor of one of our senators. Being a man of God and knowing how close we are to sign he died, I think he would say that we need to pray for the Senate. I know I am putting words in his mouth, but knowing some of us, I think that we might need to confess that we think some of them need more prayer than others. But before I get into trouble, I want to say that I am honored to welcome my friend and I am going to introduce him the way he said he really wanted to be introduced and say, here's Jimmy. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Debbie. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're going to get me in a lot of trouble with Randy Roberts and over the Senate. I promise you he's one of my parishioners, but I do the best I can. I've got to reach up there. You know, I'm honored. I'm very honored, Mr. Speaker, that you invited me to be Chaplin for today. That touched my heart and it blessed me to be able to have the opportunities to be here. I count you as my friend and I'm grateful for that. Chairman Richards Smith was such a dear friend. And Mr. Speaker, as you spoke that day, I was so moved by what you said, how you said it, and the blessing that you brought to Richards family. And I thank you brought to the entire house by representing them in such a beautiful way. You blessed us in a lot of ways. And I feel so much at home here and I'm grateful to my friend, Debbie Buckner, who does a great job representing us down Columbus Way. And I'm grateful for her friendship and her daughter, Olivia, is very special as well. Well, I said I feel very much at home here. You offer your time and you offer your gifts to the great state of Georgia. And my lifelong home has been the great state of Georgia, so I've benefited all through my life for what you as a people have done. You have helped me grow. You've helped me feel safe. You've helped me thrive and you've helped me become the person that I am today. Because of decisions you've made in this chamber and because of the way that you have touched lives and will continue to touch them in perpetuity. I'm very grateful for that. And I have the honor of being able to tell you that, not just behind your backs, but to your faces. When I stepped into the pulpit at First Baptist Church of Columbus on February 5th of 2024, I looked at that sanctuary and it was filled with individuals from across our state. Most of you were in that room. Most of you had come to honor Richard Smith for the work that he had done for the collegial relationship that you had had with him. There were people in that room from both who had in other places agreed and disagreed with each other. There were people from far reaches of the state, people who worked together and who spoke together and who made decisions together. What struck me and brought me to the brink of tears as I stood in that place, this familiar to me, but was filled with so many wonderful faces. Was it all of you gathered on level ground and you left your egos, your politics, your issues and your differences, somewhere else, and you came to honor a man together whom you respected. It was a beautiful moment and from where I stood it was a very holy moment. I'm grateful. The top officials in our state and community shared the platform and humility and grace as they remembered their friend, Richard Smith. God was present in that moment. The whole room had one focus. We realized, as I said at the funeral that a great man had fallen, we were all shocked and heartbroken for a moment, the business of the state ceased, and every heart was joined in what can only be called community. I've never seen a pure example, a parable if you please, of what it really means to be community. Communities are a group of people who, having something in common, by one definition, a feeling of fellowship with others as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals. Your common interest is the betterment of the state of Georgia. The look of Job, we see the central character Job, who struck with tragedy and loss and problems and you've seen your share of them. As we went through COVID and all sorts of other things, you've seen that happen. Well, when Job was sitting there, feeling the pain, feeling the grief, feeling the loss, he was visited by three close friends. The friends were Ella Fass, the Tiamite, build-add the shoe height, and so far the name of Thite. It said, when they heard about all of his troubles that had come upon him, they sat out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him. They began to weep aloud and they tore their robes and sprinkle dust on their heads. Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him.

because they saw how great his suffering was. The three friends came out of sympathy. They came from different places. They came to be with him and they didn't know what to say. They had no idea what to say to a person going through what he was going through, so they did the one holy thing they could, they sat in silence and created community with him for seven days. The only time they got in trouble was when they started trying to explain why he was going through it. They waited seven days before they said anything. The power of community is something that we do not need to ever underestimate. We see it in Job. I saw it in Richard's service. I saw it a number of years ago when two high-end rival builders within a community where I lived would always fight over which houses they got to build because there weren't but a few big houses being built. And whoever got it could basically take care of their business for a year. And one of them won the contract, the chosen contract, the one that everybody wanted, he won it. And he got to building it. It had a time limit on it. It had to be finished by time or it was, there would be a huge penalty to it. Toward the end of finishing it, he was injured. And everything began to fall apart. His contractors weren't doing what they needed to. Things weren't happening the way they should. They were never going to meet the time. And his rival put his job on hold, took his crew over and finished the house. The beautiful part of that was it fostered community. It overshadowed competition. Every one of you walks into this place having competed with someone at some point. You have to see a higher mission and use the co-words, cooperation, collaboration, compassion, communication, consistency, complimentary, constructive, congenial, and collegial, in short, community. That's how things get done and how God intends for us to relate to one another in our world. We cohabitate a wonderful world and are responsible for collectively working for one purpose, that being the good of humanity. When you do the poor cared for, the young people have opportunity. The creative can flourish. The missional can do good. The sick will be cared for and we will have peace. Everyone will benefit and the problems will be manageable. It all begins with community as Job showed us. It begins by sitting together in silence and entering into the human condition as you did at Richard's funeral. His death inspired me and reminded me of something a poem that I want to share as I close. When a good man dies, a thousand lights go out and it said that a great library is lost. Well, I've tried to make comparisons and wise clichés to estimate in part a good man's loss for I know the way it feels to have your heart bend low and to understand how dark the nights can be. But a good man has a heritage beyond the grave and we would be so foolish not to see that a good man leaves a light his children follow, no groping through wilderness or maze and how air their life it shines and brilliance that they can see till the ending of their days. His words came ringing deep in vibrant stereo within the deep recesses of their minds. There's guidance there enough to get to heaven when once again our hearts and arms entwine. I'm sorry for your loss here on the earth below but I'm proud to say a good man went away. You'll see him soon, it won't be long. Just follow the lights, the good man left along the way. Jesus said, you are the light of the world. The city set on a hill will not be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead. They put it on a lamp stand and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light so shine before others that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. That is what makes community and that's what makes you the blessing that you are to all of us. May God bless each of you in your deliberations in your cooperation in the community that you form in this place. We are the beneficiaries, amen. Will you bow with me as we pray? Lord, as we stand in this place, everyone brings to this moment concerns on our hearts, personal concerns for people we love, concerns for the people we represent, concerns for the state that we hold in trust, concerns for the nation that is a part of our lives and the world in which we live. May you bless, may you guide and whatever we do may it be to the benefit to building community and grace and good in the lives of others in your precious name we pray, amen. Will you join me in the pleasure of allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands when nation, God, indivisible with liberty and justice. Thank you, it's awesome.

your attention. I'm going to recognize a friend who's been that way for a number of years. My friend representative Roger Bruce is recognized for a morning order. Reptility Bruce. I'm going to recognize a friend who's recognized for a morning order. Come on, y'all. That's not right now. All right. All right. Is it late? Great. Kenny Rogers once said, you got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, and know when to run. It's time for me to walk away. As I thought about what I wanted to say on this final trip to the well, and I say final trip, I'm hoping that the rules committee didn't pass something and make me come back down here. But I will if I have to. But anyway, three things come to mind that I want to include in my final remarks. One, thank you. Two, share a few memorable moments, and three, leave you with a challenge. So after 22 years of service, managing to survive this organized chaos that we call the General Assembly, thousands of meetings, board meetings, school board meetings, PTA meetings, city council meetings, community, or excuse me, their county commission meetings, judiciary committee meetings, which was a whole lot and very long. Fulton delegation meetings and all the other meetings, events, retreats, and all the other things that we are called on to do, I simply just want to do something else. And we all have to know when our time has come. So thank God for giving me the strength to make this journey. Thanks to my wife, Angela, and my children for the countless hours away from my family so that I could be here to do this work. There are other indications that it's time to go. For example, when you have to give yourself 30 minutes to get from the CLOB to the Capitol. When you walk past the steps looking for the elevator, and if you do take the steps, you're holding on to the handrails and walking down one step at a time. When you no longer want to go to events over at the depot, because you just don't feel like making the walk, it's time to go. It's also time to go when you know that you're not going to solve all the problems in the world from this position. Because if you're in the minority party, you have a better chance of getting you hitting the lottery than you do if you're getting your bills out of rules. Yes, I want to know that I was part of a group, Al and some others. We were all part of a freshman class that thought we were going to come down here and change the world. The year that we came, we had to elect a new speaker of the house. We decided that we were not going to vote for anybody to be speaker of the house unless we interviewed them first. I thought we were going to have to call an ambulance on Calvin Smyrie. When he found out what we were planning to do, he told us that we had lost our minds that we could not interview people for speaker of the house. That's when we learned the power of numbers in this place. We had more numbers and they could not elect the speaker without us. And the candidates for speaker knew that and they agreed to the interview. During that interview, we asked them, we said that we were kind of sent him into another cardiac arrest. We told the candidates that we interviewed that we wanted to be officers on every committee that we served on. And he said, are you crazy? And we said, yep, we want to be officers. And we asked the candidates for speaker if they would agree to make us officers. One candidate said, yeah, the other candidate said no way, guess who we voted for, to become the speaker of the house. I ended up as the vice chair of the insurance committee. He's not here, but I believe Billy Mitchell ended up being the vice chair of real portionment and freshman. And we didn't know what the bathroom was, but the point was we insisted on it, we knew how the numbers worked and it happened. My first piece of legislation was to come up with a committee that was going to look at how people who they repairs in your home were licensed. And if you, he's not here either, but if you would believe that my co-sponsor of that bill was Barry Flemming. That's what I said for it. And the way it came about, the way I met Barry, he was telling somebody that he was from Harlem. And I was like, I'm from Harlem. I don't remember seeing you in Harlem. And that's when I learned that there was a Harlem Georgia as well as a Harlem New York. I mean, I was really thrown by that. But we agreed to sponsor that bill together and we have not agreed on anything since that time. My second piece of legislation was with Howard Mosby and Virgil Flaher and Alicia Morgan. It was time to set the time. We were all freshmen and we decided that we wanted to change the state flag of Georgia to remove all of the Confederate emblems that were on that flag. And we were able to get that, so few of the senior members to join us in that effort. And we got that bill passed. And what was so weird about it is that I was told I had a picture that I wanted to show you. They told me it was too graphic to put it up there. But we had people take our images off of the state site. And they made me look like I was Kadafi. They had put a beard on me, went on hats on me, and they did it with all of them. And they were all across the entire state. And I really wanted to show it to you. So if you really want to come see it afterwards, come on with my desk and I'll show it to you. But that was when the first time that we started getting phone calls hundreds by the minute. People were calling us from all over the state. Our lives were threatened. All kinds of things were happening because of that flag. The Kluclec clan marched around the capital that day. They didn't wear their masks, but they marched around the capital. I'm telling you these things because it is part of the history. We've come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. We have not done all the things that we need to do. After that first term, I was fired up and I was ready to go. I was on a mission at that point to get us a new school in the district that I served. I wanted a new school building. So I was at a school board meeting when that I talked about earlier about all the meetings I went to. I was at a school board meeting and during that school board meeting, I felt something pop in my head. Didn't know what it was. Didn't hurt. But clearly I knew something was wrong. And I went to my wife and you know, man, we never volunteered to go to the hospital, right? We don't do that. But that night, I did. I told her something was wrong and I needed to go to the hospital. When we got to the hospital, which was right down the street from the school board meeting, there was no neurologist on duty. But as we were going through the, do you have insurance routine? I passed out. A blood vessel had burst in my brain and it knocked me out. So everything that happened after that was what my wife told me happened. Since there was no, no neurologist on duty, they put me in an ambulance and they took me down to Atlanta Medical downtown. And once we were there, the neurologist that was on duty, didn't know what was going on and told my wife that he wanted to perform exploratory surgery on my brain. And my wife told him, are you crazy? I'm not going to let you do exploratory surgery on his brain. I'm going to take him to another hospital. Then they told her that if she put me in an ambulance, it took me somewhere else. I'd be dead before I got there. She's a religious lady and she said, we'll take our chances. We'll put it in the hands of God. So they took me over to Emory and Emory figured out what was going on. And they kept me in a coma so that they could do the work that they needed to do to bring me back around. Several weeks later, I woke up, not knowing that I had been out that long. I was told that my first words were, did we get the school? And yes, we did. We got the school. While recovering in the hospital, I told the nurses that I was a member of the House of Representatives and they laughed and thought I was suffering from the after effects of the surgery. That I had just gone through. Speaker Coleman arranged for me to call in and put me on those two screens that you see from my hospital bed and allowed me to say hello to everybody. I wish I had the video of the nurses when they saw that. They were like, oh, he is. Clearly that was a feeling of family. That was a time when I got so many prayers and so many people and so much support. I did feel like this was a family. And I really want to say thank you to all of you that were here when that happened. There were only few people that knew that when I came out of that coma, that I had lost my ability to read. I knew what the A was and I knew what the B was, but I could not put the sounds together to create the words. It was weird because I was still able to write, but I couldn't read what I wrote. I was still able to read what I wrote. And that was also an election year. And I was in no condition to campaign. But once again, this family that we have here stepped up. Representative Mosby, I don't know if he said he was going to try to come back. Representative Flood and others campaign for me. I was in no condition to return. But now I had to figure out how I was going to do that without the ability to read. I started therapy and discovered that I could retain things if I heard it. So I got a computer that I loaded all of the bills. I loaded all the bills on that computer and I was sit back over there and listen to the computer read those bills to me. Only my seatmate knew what was going on. Only my seatmate knew what was happening. After about nine months later, it felt like my brain just rebooted. And things were beginning to improve. I started to read, although I never was able to start reading at the same pace that I once read at. I used to read very fast. But I started reading and listening to the bills. Then the political climate change, the governor's office went to the Republicans. And several members of the House, which parties, given the Republicans the majority, a few years later, the Senate changed as well. And life has never been the same. After going through and getting adjusted to the change, another medical issue came about. I found out that I had prostate cancer. No symptoms found out during a routine checkup. I urged all of the men in this room to get checked. So I had to go to 40 days of treatment. Every day of the session, I would go to Emory at 7 a.m. in the morning for treatment. And then I would come here. I never missed one day of serving my constituents. On the last day, I hosted the doctor of the day. And I told everyone what I had gone through. And I had the doctors that treated me to address this body about the need to be treated and tested. Excuse me, to be tested. As a suggestion, Mr. Speaker, we should go back to letting the doctor of the day come to the chamber and give a quick medical tip on each time that they came. They may save their life of somebody in here. Again, I really want to thank my seatmate, Gloria Frazier. She told me she put this up there because she knew I was probably needed. But she was going to the only people in here who knew what I was going through. We sat over there and she kept me pumped up. She kept me going. She kept me in a state of mind that I did not let all those things that were happening affect what I was doing here. So Gloria, I got to say thank you. I really do. She helped me get through all of this. Derek Jackson and I, as Derek over there, we used to have a show. You were part of it for a while, too. We had our own show. We called it Under the Gold Dome. We had a two-year run on that thing. And we interviewed a lot of people. We thought we were TV stars. And we went through a lot of information and shared a lot of information, a lot of people. And Derek, I just wanted to thank you for sharing that experience with me. It was a great time while we were here. After 22 years, there are so many people to thank. And you just can't do it all. And I know that the speaker is going to push this button up here, probably at some point. But I do want to say thank you to one more person. We have parked next to each other in the same parking space for as long as I can remember. Fussing if somebody got in our parking space. We have had countless conversations about legislation, budgets, new ideas, all kinds of things. And we just talked a lot about life in general because both of us had a lot going on. My sister from another mother, Deborah Bayesmore, thank you. Thank you for always being there. There are so many more people that I want to thank. The staff, our clerk, he has been great. I've never had any issues. I grew up in telling what's going on and he was always responsive to me. So thank you, Mr. Clerk. The doorkeepers, when I walk in and they walk up to me and they say, good morning, representative Bruce, that's a great feeling. And they said not only to me, but they said to you. And I hope you respond to them and not just walk past them. Legislative Council and everybody else that helped me do this job, I really thank you. I really, really do. I know we have to move on. So finally, the challenge. Mr. Speaker, you and I have had a very good conversation about two pieces of legislation that I proposed. I want to thank you for that conversation and for understanding without judgment why I proposed those two pieces of legislation. That is the way it's supposed to be here. You talk about your differences and you try to come up with something that will satisfy everybody. You discuss it and then you move on. Whether you agree or not is not the issue. It's the fact that you had the discussion and there was an attempt. One of those bills was decided by the courts. So I won't even deal with that one. But the other one, House Bill 955 did not get a hearing in committee. That bill would treat what's given, would have created a study committee to do exactly what we did a few weeks ago. For those two people that were wrongfully arrested and jailed for something that they did not do. That was the right thing to do. We voted to give those people reparations to help them get back on their feet. Again, that was the right thing to do. And I was happy to support the action that we took that day. I believe that was your bills. Is that correct? But my challenge is that we step up once again and do the same thing for the descendants of one of the worst periods in the history of our country and our state. Slavery was real. And it is still having an impact on this country and this state. I understand the crossover has passed. But I also know that if there's a will, there's a way. We can attach that to one of these Senate bills that we're dealing with. Or Mr. Speaker, you can just form a study committee to look at this issue. It's an impact that it is having and has had. And come up with a House Study Committee that could make recommendations or legislation to be introduced in the next session. So I want you to go down in history as the speaker and the legislators that started the healing process and did for thousands of people what we did for those two people. A few weeks ago. Everyone has spoken so far about this being a family. My last request is that we do as families do that we step up, we embrace each other and help one another and do one more time what we did two weeks ago. I really appreciate all of you. I really, really do. But there's a picture that they're going to put up on that. I think they're going to put it up there. Then I wanted you to see because people keep asking me what I'm going to do next. I'm going to do two things. My colleague, where is he? He's not there. We're going to have, we're going to start our own business. We're going to do documentaries about people that have constant of sort of know who I'm talking about. You had in the corner. We're going to do documentaries about people who have done things to help this state in this country. They have not had an opportunity to be recognized for all the things that they've done. We're going to do that but also is the picture coming up. Okay, I'm good. If the speaker's good, I'm good. There's a whole lot of other things I wanted to say, but I'm not going to say, but I want you to see this picture. Hopefully, they'll get it up there shortly. That's what I'm going to be doing. I'm headed to Texas to spend time with my granddaughter, Nova. That is Nova. Somebody take a picture of that so I have that on their big screen. So to all of you, I just want to say thank you, God bless you, and Mr. Speaker with that, I yield a well. I'm representing Bruce. Thank you for 22 years of serving Georgia. The people of your district, but more importantly, serving high and entire state. What a beautiful thing. Good luck, Godspeed you. How about come up with me? Representative Roger Bruce, all. Let's give him another round of applause and show him our appreciation. Thank you, Representative Bruce. The Pedro Pete Marion. I'm going to ask members to give the member and the well your attention. General will suspend just for a minute. As if you will, representing Bruce, if you all push back just a little bit, that'll be great. Or you can go to the south and I know some folks want to come congratulate you on your years of service as well as take a photo in front of those flags, which is always pretty impressive. Please give the member and the well your attention. How many years you've been here, Representative Marin? Twenty-two. Twenty-two as well. What a class. What a class. No, I didn't brought water. You need water? Yeah, just. Thank you. Glad your assistant was able to assist. Well, she did a pretty good job. Representing is recognized. Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pedro Pete Marion. We appreciate you, man. Go ahead now. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, Buenos dias. So I asked the speaker to do this speech next Wednesday because my wife was going to be here next Wednesday because time and I asked my wife and she said, you know what? Better. Because the last thing I want is to see you cry. So it's truly has been a ride. My God. I've truly been honored. And I think one of the things that I wanted to do, Mr. Speaker, is just kind of tell folks how do I came to this great institution. And then as you know, born and raised in San Juan Puerto Rico, beautiful island of the Caribbean. And we move as a corporate transfer. And three months after we were here, the company went into a big merger. And I got one of those calls saying, Pedro, it's going to take about six months to get this through a year. I saw my wife crying. Let's go back home. We wanted to stay. We did a, we did a democratic vote.

And my son and myself wanted to stay. She wanted to leave. So to the one we stayed. So what I did was I reinvent myself around helping nonprofit organization. As you know, something happened in the 1990s, which was the Olympics. And we had that flux of workers coming in to build. The venues and the renaz and everything. But there was a lot of organization that were not really catered to deal with that growing community. So I started doing nonprofits, went to nonprofits, different nonprofits, developing their Latino initiative until I became the executive director of a nonprofit. And I was the executive director for about 2 1 1 half years. The organization used to be called the Mexican Center of Atlanta, Puerto Rican, the executive director of the Mexican Center of Atlanta. And I learned a lot about the Mexican community here in the state of Georgia. In 2001, a former governor Roy Barnes asked me to join a commission on his panic affairs. So in 2001, that was the first time that I came to the capital to my Australian and committee meetings and everything. In 2002, there was an open seat where I left. So I had a group of leaders that asked me to run for office, which I did. And I ran and opposed that first time. And I think it's important that we always recognize our opponents, because I have always said that our opponents makes us stronger. And I'm going to read, because I have several friends that were my opponents, George Warren, 2004, Torrey Lewis, 2006, Kishur, 2008, Torrey Lewis, again, 2008, Brian Muck, Mayor of Chambley, 2010, Mark Williams, 2012, Rick Underwood, 2016, and Dailene Laurie, 2022. So I've been contested, believe me. So I know a little bit about politics. In fact, I'm announcing today, Mr. Speaker, that in 2026, I'm putting a company called All I Do Is When, Consulting Group. So you have a race and everything just going to be. But you might not find me, because I'd be probably in the Hammock Ocean brief with a Pinyacolata in my hand. So looking forward to that. But I was talking to you the other day with a group of young leaders. And one of them asked me, what would be my legacy in 22 years in the House of Representatives? And legacy is when you're about done or you're there. And I can say that my legacy has been to really build that bridge between the diverse communities of Georgia and state government. Because again, I help. And I'm not going to say I was the one, but I help in bringing Latinos, of course, and Latinos from different countries. But also the Vietnamese community, the Korean community, Chinese community, Pakistan, Indian, Muslims. So again, I think that has been my legacy in making sure those groups are not in the state capital. And today, I brought the Chattaro Association of Georgia. Because I think it's important that we know them. And people around the hallways see them and their costumes and their tradition. Because it is a tradition. Had the honor to be that work with four speakers, of course, when I came in Terry Coleman, Glenn Richardson, the great David Ralston and my friend in the back, Mr. John Burns. Governors, of course, I serve under Roy Barnes with that commission on Hispanic affairs. Sonny Perdue, David Ralston, I mean Sonny Perdue, Nathan Deel, and Brian Kim. So again. And now hearing from Roger Bruce on his away speech and we came from the same class in 2003. I did the math, and there's 10 representative from both sides that are retiring this year. And I did the math. And there's 154 years of knowledge and wisdom leaving the house this year. 154 years of knowledge in between the legislatures that are retiring this year. And to all of them, my heart goes to them. This is a difficult job. Whoever tells you that this is like Boy Scouts. I don't know who's being in the Boy Scout as a leader. Oh, yeah. You're going to do a one hour a week. A line. A line. Because they say, well, three months a year. And that's it. 40 days assembly. And that's it. Now, this has become a year type of job. And for us, it's really difficult to sometimes juggle personal life, professional life, and political life. Because we always, we have to be out there. If we want to get reelected, we want to get our name out, work with the community. Things happen. And June 10th. 2017. I lost my soul. Oh, no, no, no. Sit, sit, sit. Please sit. Our only child. So I love it. Representative, this whole house greased, greased, we're giving you a family. The loss of your son is no doubt about that. And our heart still goes out to you. I want to thank a lot of the members that were with me that day. It's not easy. It's not easy being your only child. So I saw that Royal Year Bruce was seen in his future. That's when I told my wife in 2018 that we were going to be done. I was going to be done early. That we were going to try to retire. And enjoy ourselves and travel and all that. So 2018, I didn't keep the promise. 2020, I didn't keep the promise. 2022, I didn't keep the promise. 2024, she was here with me when I did the announcement just to make sure that I was making that announcement about retirement. And we are, I wanted to do this to speech, maybe do an email press release or something like that. But I had some leaders that wanted me to do a press conference on the steps of the Capitol. And I want to thank Speaker Burns, Chair of Friskration, Leader of the Release, and so many others that were with me at that moment. When I announced that I was not going to retire, saying that, believe me, I carry my paperwork and a check in a briefcase for about a week. Because I announced over a month and a half, and I didn't hear anything in my district. And I said, oh my God. And my wife said, what happened? I said, you know, nobody is announcing. And I said, you're not going to do it. And I say, you know, there's two scenarios. There's two scenarios. And you know, always keeping, I'm one of those that I see the glass half full. So two scenarios. One, that nobody qualifies, I will have to qualify by default because I don't want to leave the district vacant. Or that, and the posting party will qualify and no Democrat will qualify. I will have to qualify to protect the seat. But that didn't happen. We have three outstanding ladies running for the seat. So you're going to have some new phrase faced from the 96th district. You know, it has been truly an honor. I've seen so many speeches in my 22 years about people leaving. A lot, believe me, a lot of speeches. And you know, you dread that day that it comes to you. And I didn't sleep last night, believe me. Even with me, I had to take a little overdose of melatonin last night so I can take a shot. But you're going to think about what you're going to say or how it's going to be received. You know, we have laughter. We have tears. You know, people are paying attention. So, you know, I want to make sure that my wife has been my rock for, in fact, we're celebrating this month, 41 years of marriage. So it's, and thank you. And she told me, are you going to record that? Are you going to take that? I say, yeah. Are you going to see me crying? And in the podium. So she was just looking forward to that. But you know, we got together and you know, has been a blessing. And you know, like I say, has been the rock future. You know, what holds for us is, you know, I have to, of course, finish my term because I'll be the representative until my replacement stores in come since I have duties. But, you know, our job is not easy, you know. And one time I saw my calendar, I was maybe five nights, six nights away from home. And I know that you guys have done the same, you know, because you have to, you know, be at maybe ribbon cuttings or, and at ward or just a meeting that they want to have you in that meeting. So it had stern into, and I, and a couple years ago, I draw the line and I say, okay, I'm going to event if I want to speak, if I want to give something away or I want to be receiving something, okay. But just to go and eat the chicken, you know, to a gala or get myself dressed up to go to gala and just to stand up and, you know, not running for a relation. So, you know, that helps. But you got it. You guys got to do it. Mr. Speaker, it's, it has truly been an honor, you know. And I don't want to talk about things that happened, things that didn't happen. I want to send, and I know she's watching my, you know, my, I'm an interested assistant. You know, we all have a minister of assistant and we deal a lot to then because they're the front, they're the front between our constituents and ourselves. So to Kimberly Weidman, you know, on sweet 6-11, you know, I love you. You know, we've been together for 22 years. You know, I told myself that I say, well, I have one of those corner office and I told Kimberly and I think I told Sandra. I said, I want to, I want to do an option, you know, who's the best beater to get that corner office. And of course, that's not up to me. That's up to the guy behind me. But somebody already said, oh, no, that's mine. So, you know, I'm blessed that I've been well recognized nationwide, you know, from different, different groups. University of Georgia is going to come and pick up a lot of my stuff, a lot of my awards, my presentations, speeches that I have done in the well and in other places because UGA is doing archives for Latino political history. Okay, so I'm going to have them come in in a couple months so they can start. I want to choose a couple because I want to take home several that has really mean for me. Will they come and take a lot of, a lot of the things that I have in my office? And of course, research paper bills that I've done, that's going to go to UGA on the archives, which is great. I think Brenda Lopez did it, soon my Lopez also as well. Of course, they didn't have as many years and as much stuff that I got. You know, I was always joking because I was a chair at the office where Mickey Stevens and, you know, my heart still goes to his family. You know, and when he moved in, oh my God, you're choosing his office everywhere. You know, things everywhere. And we were joking among our students and say, I hope he stays because you believe to pick up all that stuff. It's sad to say he had to go two years later so he had to pick up. And then we saw him come back and we were in that corner. I spent a lot of my time with Billy and Mickey Stevens on that corner and I remembered. What was the tall guy, big guy that used to sit in the corner, long time ago? Remember, no, that's not what... Well, that place used to be the space to smoke, all right? So the old timers know that they used to smoke in 1998. But that used to be the smoke room for us. And that group right there, every time that door is swinging, open and closes, oh my God, you can feel and you can smell the tobacco, the fumes and everything. You know, so James Limor, the big guy, yes, yes. And he was the one that really stood up and said, we gotta stop doing that. So again, I haven't seen the red light so that's good. I can maybe do a song and dance. No, it's has truly been an honor. Things happen in life and going back to my son, the only thing we're happy is that we have him for 32 years. And it was our best 32 years that we had. Things happen. They call him up. And again, I just want to say thank you for a lot of my friends and a lot of members here, my colleagues that were supportive at that time of grief. You know, because it's not easy to lose a family member, nevertheless, losing your only child. So with that, but I mean by the way, I always said that in the corner, it has been a hell of a ride. It has been an incredible experience. I'm truly honored that someone born and raised in the island of Puerto Rico came to the states. Georgia, Winnett, and you know, I took the bull by the horns. Yes, let me, let me, let me pat myself on that because, you know, I saw a need. I saw that there was a voice to be heard. I, you know, I saw that we needed to embrace our immigrant community. And I've done that. I had standing well many times arguing. And in fact, I did that not too long ago arguing on bad bills, but, you know, it is what it is. You know, this is political. You have to understand that one thing I learned a long time ago, don't take it personal. And please, members, this is if the only thing you get from my speech today is this is politics. Don't take it personal because again, this is not because of who you are or who you are not. This is just the way it is. So again, now I'm passing the baton to Long Tran, you know, Sam Park, you know, for Rue, Sarah and Phil, Ray Martinez was with me all today, all day with the Charros Association. Greg, right, we know, we know each other for a long time. But again, members, you know, my heart goes to you. Please keep doing the work that you do for the people of Georgia. You know, I've been blessed that I landed in Georgia and, you know, it has been, has been really, really exciting and honor. I cannot say it any better way than that has truly been me being honored to be your colleague and to stand side by side, many of you, you know, for the people of my colleagues that have passed away during my 22 years. Again, my heart goes to their families. But the show must go on with that, Mr. Speaker. I yielded well. Thank you. We represent the mayor and thank you for your service to this house and how you care about this house and the family of this house. Thank you for your service to your community. Thank you for your service to your district. If you will come up and join me if you don't mind. I'm not going to have a privilege or how we call it in inquiry, parliamentary inquiry. You know, I love this house so much that I, with the company, Jolston Company, which makes rings. I design a ring for members of the house here in the Georgia. And I know several, but five, six years ago, we did that. Several members have done that. So again, this is how much I love this house that I even design a ring, which I have on right now, that when you are vested, what better that, you know, you get your ring. I yielded well again. Absolutely. Thank you for that. I'm looking forward to seeing that ring. Thank you for your service. Members will move on to the rules calendar. On to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption Senate bill 483-483? Senate bill 483 by Senator Hatchett of the 50th, Patrick of the 32nd, Tillery the 19th, to be entitled Act to a Men Title 39. And then, which go to George Antenna, related and minor, so is to enter into an interstate compact for the placement of children. This bill ever further the committee on juvenile justice. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Joseph Gullet is recognized to present Senate bill 483. Give the gentleman the well your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I present Senate bill 43, a legislative proposal aimed at enacting the revised interstate compact for the placement of children, also known as the ICPC. This bill represents a critical step forward in our ongoing efforts to modernize and improve the welfare and placement processes for children across state lines. The need for such reform is clear. The original interstate compact on placement of children was established in 1960 and was a pioneering effort to ensure safe, suitable placement for children in foster care and adoption across state boundaries. It created a framework for cooperation and communication between states, a framework that is undoubtedly served as well. However, as you guys know, the world has changed significantly since 1960 and our systems must evolve to keep pace with these changes. This revised ICPC as proposed in this bill seeks to address these evolving needs through several key improvements. First, it aims to evaluate the suitability of prospective parent placements through uniform mechanisms, ensuring that children are placed in environments that are not just safe, but also conducive to their growth and well-being. It also aims to provide the necessary support services to these families, ensuring they are equipped to meet the needs of their new family members. Moreover, the bill seeks to narrow the applicability of the compact, focusing our resources and attention where they are most needed. It proposes the development of specific time frames for completing the approval process for child placements. And that's super important today. The time frame is really, really long. The establishment of clear rulemaking authority, the clarification of state responsibilities, and the increase in protection for familial relationships or all measures designed a streamlined and improved the place of care. The placement process is also crucial to understand that this compact will not go into effect until 35 states have enacted the legislation and adopted it as of today. There are 16 states that have already taken this step. And by Georgia being the top first 35 states to enacted a compact has a unique opportunity to contribute and influence the formulation of the rules and regulations that will govern the new ICPC. And the chance for Georgia to lead to ensure that our values and our commitment to the welfare and children are reflected in this critical crucial interstate agreement. That's all I have, Mr. Speaker. Happy to answer any questions there are any in the I urge your favourable consideration. You have a question, Representative Jasmine Clark, do you left to recognize for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Sure. Thank you so much for bringing this legislation. It is very important. I'm curious you said that this won't go into effect until there's 35 states and currently there's 16. Right. The 16 states are they in the South, Southeast? Where are they or do you know the 16? I think that was said in committee but I don't know the 16 or where they are. I'm sorry. All right. Can I, does the gentleman further yield? Sure. So let's say the child is placed in a state that is quite far away, quite a distance away. I know that it's still going to be the responsibility of Georgia to make sure that that child is taking care of. Right. But if for whatever reason maybe there's a family or relative here in Georgia that now wants to step in and step back up, whose responsibility would it be to possibly transport or get that child back to Georgia so they can be with actual family? So my understanding is the majority of these placements are out of state or for adoption so they're not foster. So these families that have these children are in the process most of the time to be adopting these children. And so once that, once that path is gone, I don't think just because there's a familiar relationship that all of a sudden it's pulled back. It's really wasn't the best interest for the child on a case by case basis. So that's kind of where that, I believe that would be. Thank you. Thank you. There are a number of questions Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. No more questions. Gentlemen, is yielded the well representing the Hutchinson is recognized to speak to the bill representing Hutchinson? Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just get it. Good morning colleagues. I wanted to come up here a few minutes just to talk about how consequential this bill is. I spent a good chunk of my career filling out ICPC applications. And when they're done it's about this thick of paperwork. You have to include court documents and the application itself and records and everything. And what you do is you send it to the ICPC coordinator in whatever state and it sits on a desk for until they get to it, which can take years. And I have seen adoptions slow up because of this process for years. So this would be very consequential. I hope the other states sign on. But when we talk about adoptions and we talk about how long it takes, this is one of the barriers to adoption. I hope that you vote yes for this bill. But I also wanted to tell you about one of the ICPC applications that I did. It was two children in custody in Georgia and they found grandmother in Hawaii. I did the application. I lobbied to take the children myself. I was denied. But to watch those kids go from foster care to a beach in Hawaii was one of the highlights of my career. So if you have any questions about ICPC, I'd be more than happy to answer that, but other than that, I yield the will. Ladies yielded the will. She had no questions. We have no further speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Chair, to submit, will the exam be KA-20,adorescio, OrBOB? … Have all members voted. All members voted. If so, if so, the cleric will lock the machine.

The defense go to Georgia annotated relating to licenses for funeral directors and imbalmers, so it's to change certain provisions related to the reinstatement of a lapsed funeral directors license. This bill then referred to the committee unregulated industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Jason Ridley is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know it's early and I know this is going to take a little while. It's a complex bill. Last year we passed out of the bill.

that if you were a funeral director and you lost your license, that just elapsed. You hadn't actually lost them through any sort of correction, but you that just elapsed that you could have a period of time to go back to do that. If you repaid all the fees and everything, there was one little problem with it that the Attorney General found on line 13. We needed to add three words or has allowed. And that's all this bill does. I'm ashamed to say that it is so complex they pick me to do it. So Mr. Speaker, if there's any questions I'll take, any. You have no question. Fact is stranger than fiction sometimes. That's exactly right. Thank you. I yield oil. Gentlemen's yield of the well is any objection to the previous question being ordered that you're here as none. The previous question is ordered.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Chair Lady Ballinger is recognized to present the bill. Chair Lady Ballinger. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is a really simple bill. It just facilitates the recovery of missing children and it would allow defects to share information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Lady has no questions. Thank you. I urge your favorable consideration of this measure. Lady, is your to the well?

This bill I'm referring to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Todd Jones is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring to you SB 232. This bill is effectively modernizing the probate fee structure. It went through the Senate 49 to 0. So massive bipartisan support and it also went through House Judiciary. Effectively, it has three sections. The first section regards filing fees, administrative fees, etc. The second section speaks to the state children trust fund and the $15 that's applied to each marriage application license and its dedication to that fund. And then section three speaks to inageant services and then also reform services and then also the rebate of those fees. You go through the bill. You will see that not only has there been a significant amount of work done by the judges and also by the Senate but in terms of multiple years in terms of this bill has been looked at in terms of making sure that hopefully we got it right and that you agree with me. Mr. Speaker, that is effectively the summary of the bill and I'll yield for any questions. Chairman, has no questions. Thank you, sir. I yield the well. Chairman, is yielded the well? Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

So it's a limit to length of a director's hold over period following expiration of the turn of office. This bill I've referred to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Matthew Gamble is recognized to present the bill, Representative Gamble. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to present Senate bill 171. This legislation has the support of the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Economic Developers Association. All this bill does is it will require two hours of training annually for development authority board members. This requirement will ensure that authority members are appropriately trained and aware of all the development and redevelopment programs and laws impacting economic development in our state. This training can be done online or in person, and there are providers throughout the state that are currently doing this for free. If a director fails to undertake the training in two years, they'll have their voting rights suspended until they complete their training. Also, this bill has a provision that allows a development authority to appoint or reappoint a board authority member if the governing entity such as the city or a county hasn't taken that action within six months. Again, all this bill will ensure that our development authorities are being managed in an efficient and professional manner. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill, and I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration and I'll yield the well. General Maggio to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to the chair? Here's none of the previous questions ordered.

Members, if you will join me in welcoming former member Michael Gravley. Representative Gravley. He hasn't changed his hair castile. It's all good. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 430? Senate bill 430 by Senator Dolezell, 27th, Watson, 1st, Scooch, 51st, Roberts, 29th and others, being taught to amend. Chapter 16, Title 51 of the Efficiency of the Georgia Anitator relating to COVID-19 pandemic business safety, social revised provisions for affordable presumptions of risk by claimants. This bill I'm for committee on judiciary. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Carter Barrett is recognized to present the bill. Representative Barrett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate bill 430 was passed unanimously in the sentiment. In 2020, when COVID-19 liability protections were put into place, it was contingent upon the business placing a sign or posting language on a ticket. I'm sure you've all seen the signs. This bill keeps the COVID-19 liability in place, but it is no longer dependent upon placing the sign in your lobby of the business or on your ticket. With this bill, we can remove the signs from the front of stores while still having the COVID protections in place. That's it. Very simple bill. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Representative Rees, do your right. Has a question. Do your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman you'll for a question. For my most excellent friend, I do. Thank you. Is it not true that Georgia exercised leadership during the pandemic and was one of the first states to safely reopen, which kept the doors of a lot of small businesses open? Unequivocally and unambiguously. Absolutely yes. The gentleman to your left. Representative Kelly has a question. If you're yielded, thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. Yes, I did. Isn't it true that as a result of the COVID-19 liability protections that we put in place during the pandemic that we haven't seen any lawsuits regarding COVID transmission across our state? I'm sure that the very clever, very, very bright gentleman knows exactly what he speaks. Do you live for Representative Jasmine Clark as a question? I will take one more question, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Yes, I did. So when we were removing these signs, were the signs causing a burden on our small businesses or businesses in general? Well, I mean, Georgia is again the top state in the nation for doing business. So anything that makes life a little easier on businesses and reduces additional unnecessary requirements is always a good idea. I think the statute actually expired back in 2022. So again, it's kind of a moot point probably. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. Do you worry that when the sign comes down, people might think the law has changed for them and that now this is not the law of the land. They're used to seeing the sign and now the sign is gone. Is there any concerns about that? Was that concern raised by anyone? I'm not concerned for that. And the Senate approved this bill unanimously. It wasn't too terribly concerned. I don't think. But no, this was created during the middle of a crisis while we were figuring things out and we're four years in now. And I think the world is officially up to speed. Thank you for your question. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Jim was yielded well. You didn't have some questions, but a year to the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous question. Is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. I have all my well. Have all members vote if a what purpose does representative Newton rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. The speaker isn't it true that the actions taken by Georgia during the COVID-19 pandemic were supported by both medical and scientific background that was really led by our public health director, Dr. Kathleen Tumy. Is there any question that would be true for what purpose does representative Newton rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. The speaker isn't it true that the actions taken by Georgia during the COVID-19 pandemic were supported by both medical and scientific background that was really led by our public health director, Dr. Kathleen Tumy, who we owe a great debt of gratitude. Isn't that true, Mr. Speaker? That would be true. For what purpose is representing park can and rise? Amendmentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that currently today in Georgia is it stands Seminole County, Miller County, Decatur County, Turner Tift, Irwin, Ben Hill, Colquitt, Spalding, but Washington, Jefferson, Lowns, Lanier, Eccles, Cookbrooks, and Barian counties are the highest number having COVID diagnoses this month? I'm sure the lady has her figures correct for purposes representing all of her rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. I make an assumption, sir, that most of the Republican leadership is for tort reform. Isn't it true that this bill increases the liability for Georgia's business and is against tort reform? I'm sure the lady is a learning attorney and she understands the law very well. Thank you for your insight. For what purpose does representing the hung rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that while this bill removes the signage requirement, nothing in this bill requires anyone to visit restaurants or big gatherings if they do not feel comfortable doing so? I think I've heard that as well. We are a state and a country who makes decisions based on our own personal will be an integrity. No doubt about that. Have all members now voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the pass of Senate Bill 430, the A's of 146, the NA's are 27. This bill, I haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, we're going to take up Senate Bill 389 that we carried over from last week on several occasions. Someone asked a clerk will you read the caption to Senate Bill 389, 389. I've centered paying the 54th compatriot to the 32nd Hodges of the 3rd and others to be entitled to amend Part 4 of Article 3, Chapter 2, Title 38. The Fish Go to Georgia and A Teder relating to rights, privileges and prohibitions those to provide for the general to be an official sponsor of the state-sponsored life insurance program for the Georgia National Guard. This bill then referred to the Committee on Insurance. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Carson, Chairman John Carson has recognized to present the bill, Representative Carson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, I present for your consideration Senate Bill 389. This is an agency bill. I think many of you received a letter on your desk from Commissioner of Insurance John King. All this does is specifically address the provision of a state-sponsored life insurance plan to the members of our Georgia National Guard. This move is in response to existing federal law but also some regulations that have changed which facilitate life insurance programs for National Guardsmen. There's one thing I did need to verify with the National Guard. This does not have a state cost. All this does is specifically note a state-sponsored plan and a state-endorse plan under the Agitant General. And what this will do is clear up throughout the Guard that this is the one state plan that's available for all of our hard-working National Guardsmen. If there's no questions, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for the body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen, has a question representing Gladney if you'll take one to your left? Yes, sir.

Representative Angle Willis is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Willis. And I ask the members to stand, please. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today arise to acknowledge the glorious life of a friend, a Howard sister, and Borkhaven resident, Zinzi Zinzelay, with said. Some people are flashing lights that electrify the spaces that they enter. She was that. She was here and she mattered. She was a trained artist with the beauty of the Indian team. I would like to thank you, Zinzi, for your artistry, your magic, and your friendship. May the ancestors welcome you home. Our Howard sister, Zyra Neal Hurston wrote, I have the nerve to walk my own way. However hard in search of my own reality, rather than climb upon the rattling wagon of your wishful illusions, that was her. I asked for a moment of silence for the life and legacy of Zinzi, what said. Fly high, my sister, float on, and with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the well. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Willis, for that. Remember, it's a remainser is recognized for a moment in history. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm sorry that this picture is a little blurry, but one of the things that I wanted to just point out for women's history month is, thank you for that. I used to work in the Office of HIV, AIDS, and STBs for CDC. The very first job I had coming out of college was working for the US Surgeon General. This current diagnosis, new HIV diagnoses among women by transmission category. It basically says up to 80% of women get new diagnoses of HIV AIDS through heterosexual contact. The reason I'm bringing this up today for women's history is because it now includes transgender in the women's category. If we are going to continue to protect women with research, we must not be disparaging to women facts. So that is the women's history moment that now transgender women are included in scientific data of the women category. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Representative New, Representative Kimberly New has recognized for an afternoon order. Give the lady in the wheel your attention, please. I'd like to ask my friends to join me. Yes, she has friends. I do have friends today. Another moment in history. Sir, cut us out of like I didn't have friends. I'm not surprised. You're a pretty nice person. In honor of Women's History Month, I'd like to highlight Viola Ross Napier from Bibb County and Bessie Kempton Crowell from Fulton County. These remarkable women were elected to the Georgia House of Representatives September 13, 1922, 102 years ago. These were the first women elected into the Georgia General Assembly just two years after the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote.

NAPER was a schoolteacher, a mother. She pursued her dreams of becoming an attorney after her husband passed away. No one would employ her, so she started her own practice. She became a lawyer, started her own practice. She started representing other women. Besie Kimpton-Krowell was an Atlanta constitutional reporter. She served three terms in the legislature ending in 1931. She went on to become the editor and publisher of the Fulton County Daily Report. You know Underground Atlanta? She did that with a viaduct bill. So her legacy is still here and around the corner. We're sitting here today thanks to Napier and Crowell's unwavering hard work and dedication. They helped lay the foundation for all women in Georgia. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Our State of Better Place representative Imredana Hu is recognized for an after-nord. Please give the gentleman and the well your attention. Thank you, Miss Speaker. A year ago today we rang the bell with my wife Elaine. Prayer is amazing. She rang the bell a year ago today and if she behaves tomorrow will be our 43rd anniversary. She is up in my office cleaning it up, mopping and making sure everything looks good. I love you Elaine. Happy anniversary. And my grandson Levi is back here or maybe on the wall. Levi Joseph Brownlee stick your hand up. So thank you very much, Miss Speaker. Elaine we're so happy for you. And so no you're so blessed by the good Lord. No doubt about it. All Williams has recognized for an afternoon order representative. All Williams. Thank you, Miss Speaker. At the expense of possibly upsetting some of you. I kind of stood to say after listening to some of my brother on the Senate side who had opinions on Rivion and the plant of near social circle having spent having spent 24 years on the development of already Liberty County and now the chairman. I hate to shock us but do you realize that when we elected it does not make us an expert in economic development. I must say Pat Wilson has done an excellent job and I do think that this is not the end of the story. But there are call back provisions in there but let's don't get involved in the intricate details of things that we really don't do every day for living. I would never try to perform surgery. So let's just give it a chance. I've lost too many projects to Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina and it's not the end of it. I watched the Mercedes plant with schedule for Savannah. We thought the world ended when it didn't come but look at that mega site now. Let's keep our eyes on the prize and stay out of the making of the sausage in the details of economic development. Thank you Miss Speaker. Thank you, Representative Williams. You're right. Chairman Bonner, you recognize for a special afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we honored the 2023 class of inductees into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame. This diverse group of 15 men and women represent the best the state of Georgia has to offer. The class include ranks from private first class to a four star general and spans service from World War II to present day. Among the honorees are two service members killed in action and two prisoners of war. Two of the inductees honored for their service were Commissioner of our own Department of Veteran Services, Patricia Ross and former Governor Nathan Deal. All of the Hall of Fame photos are on display in their new permanent home on the first floor of the Capitol where thousands of Georgia's each year can read their stories and recognize the sacrifice made on their behalf to keep our nation free. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was a great day. Some great remembrances. Chair Lady Matthew Yanks recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I would like to invite my friends in the house to visit with Gordon University students. They are here in the Capitol in room 230 and they'll be there right now until about 230.
