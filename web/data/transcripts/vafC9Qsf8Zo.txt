a beautiful way to start the legislative session in the house with the reigning Miss Georgia,
Audrey Cattilla, serenading house members with her voice and her violin. Good evening and
Welcome to Lawmakers.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.
It's the 158th session of the Georgia General Assembly and the 56th season of Lawmakers.
It's a campaign year and several lawmakers are running for higher office during the session.
A few have departed to either focus on their campaigns and there are other reasons why
they've left.
That means there are some new faces under the Gold Dome.
For the next 40 days, expect bills in the areas of education, property, and state income
taxes, and artificial intelligence.
Plus a major focus on affordability, looking for budget-friendly housing and health care
legislation.
But before getting in all that, let's find out what happened today from our own capital
correspondence, Sarah Callis, who happens to be here for a change and not all the way
at the dome, where I don't have to yell at you to get there.
So thanks for being here on set.
thank you for having me always great to be we're we're happy to get into this
session our first day of lawmakers and it's somewhat busy there a lot of
procedural things yeah it was great to be back at the Capitol with the lawmakers
crew and today lawmakers got to work very quickly in a newly renovated house
and senate chambers under the gold dome it's the first day of the past
session and as expected both floors gabbled out after accomplishing
procedural business. They welcomed new members in both chambers.
Let's give our new Senator from Cobb County, Senator Howard from the 35th here. Let's give
him a big round of applause. And the Senate unanimously selected
Senator Larry Walker III as the new president pro tempore.
My father taught me that, you know, while we sit on different sides of the aisle or come
from different areas of the state or different perspectives were all bound by a common duty
to leave Georgia better than we found it. He understood that leadership isn't about
the title you hold, but the people you serve. And as I take this guy while I hope to honor
his legacy by bringing the same spirit of steady, principal leadership to this role.
Walker replaces Senator John F. Kennedy, who resigned his seat last year to run for
Lieutenant Governor in this year's election.
In the House, lawmakers debated the 2026 legislative calendar.
The issue is actually Friday, March 20th, which is the end of Ramadan, and usually there's
like prayers people travel, see family, and we do have staff that could be impacted.
Is there any way that we could potentially shift the committee work day that week and
then just switch them out essentially?
As I understand it, religious holidays, such as this holiday that you've referenced,
may be over several days.
What I would just say is that holidays that are celebrated maybe at different times of
the day, that that understanding and accommodation can be made certainly, so that if there's an evening
time celebration or something like that, we may not be in session.
But I would just say that this schedule has been very carefully vetted.
In the end, both chambers approved the full schedule as presented for the legislative
session.
House members also paid tribute to Representative Mandy Ballinger, who passed away last year
after a battle with cancer.
What a great member of this house, what a great advocate for children in this state, for
those great advocate for those who suffer from domestic abuse.
Not only in this house, but in the South Eastern United States and in America.
And they enjoyed a special performance from Miss Georgia.
Meanwhile, people flocked to the Capitol for the ACLU
pack the Capitol event, advocating for communication
between legislators and their constituents.
To our elected officials, we are here to engage,
not to disrupt.
We are here to educate, not intimidate.
We are here to work with you, like democracy should.
Last week, we got a preview of some of the legislative
priorities to expect this session.
When Republican Speaker of the House, John Burns spoke with reporters.
Whether it be health care, whether it be property taxes, whether it be income taxes, all
the things that impact our lives.
So what we want to make sure of, that when we address affordability issues in so many
and a wide variety of instances across the board, that we want Georgians to keep their
dollars.
And lawmakers teamed up with agricultural and civic leaders to support area food banks,
eat some barbecue and talk with reporters at the annual wild hog supper last night.
They also welcome new legislators, including the youngest lawmaker under the gold dome.
I feel very proud of what I represent and what I stand for.
I especially want to come to the youth.
I mean, we're seeing this wave incoming of just pressure blood, pressure ideas.
It's not so much of a matter of age with me in particular.
When it comes to politics, it's more of a drive and energy.
And you see this with the newer wave that we want to get things done on the foundational
level.
Practical level, I want to make sure folks know what's going on.
So when we talk about words, like affordability, what does it look like behind the scenes?
What's the process to make sure things actually get done?
When we have issues with home prices, when it comes to corporate landlords, when it comes
to private equity distorting things or algorithms artificially inflating rents and food prices,
We want to go through the process to make things better here in Georgia.
And another interesting aspect of this session is the number of new lawmakers who are running
for higher office while still serving in the legislature.
That's my Capitol report.
And we're going to talk about that right now with you, because you're staying with us.
It's so wonderful to have you here.
And with veteran reporter Ty Tagami with Capitol Beat New Service, and that's a GPB contributing
partner.
Thank you for being here.
On this first day of the Georgia Legislative session, 2026.
So let's talk about this.
As Sarah mentioned, we have, it's an election year and then we have people running for
office who are, who did not step down during this time, explain, explain why some left
maybe and some are still around for people who don't understand that.
You cannot fundraise during the legislative session if you're in office.
It's a significant handicap and it's hard to get out there and beat the campaign trail
if you have to be at the Capitol every day, so I think that that's a significant reason.
But we'll still see a lot of them talking about trying to get camera time, I think, and
talking about the legislation that they're supporting that they think will help.
And so they're still there.
They want to have some good legislation to go back to their districts and say this is
what I did.
Yeah, absolutely, this is the last chance to perform
for their constituents, right?
That's true.
Not only are all 236 seats in both chambers
up for election, but every constitutional office
on the ballot.
And so there's a lot in terms of that too, in terms
of how people are going to be looking at what they do.
So maybe do you think we'll see a lot
of the cultural issues come up this time
because there's so many eyes on them?
Well, historically, that's been a big thing,
that we've come up, seen come up in election years.
That's something that certainly gets a lot of media attention,
which we've said they often chase during these years.
But, you know, leadership in both the House
and the Senate Chamber have said that this is going to be
a year where they're focused on the kitchen table issues,
affordability being the biggest one
that I hear over and over again.
Okay, I want to tell you about those,
the lawmakers who are running for office.
So, in the Senate, there is Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones.
seeking the governor's office.
There are three Republicans and one Democrat running for Lieutenant Governor, two Republicans
for Attorney General, one Democrat hopes to become insurance commissioner, and a Democrat
and a Republican have their eyes on U.S. congressional seats.
In the House, two Democrats are running for governor, a Republican is looking at the
Lieutenant Governor's seat, a Democrat is buying for the Attorney General's office, and
And one person has thrown his hat in for Secretary of State.
And then there's one making a bid for U.S. Congress.
So a lot of that going on.
And as we mentioned, a lot of competition for making sure they're getting out there.
And so the fact that they can't raise money, those who left are doing just that, right?
Yeah, they're out there.
They haven't, you know, we don't have any reporting required for fundraising yet anytime
soon, but I assume that they're out there beating the bushes and taking advantage of
their free time.
Okay.
So, let's get into some of the big issues that we're hearing about already affordability
on both sides of the aisle.
The speaker is pushing for property tax relief, so talk a little bit about what he's
looking to do.
Yeah.
I mean, one thing that the speaker brought up in his pre-session press conferences is
that some Georgians feel like they're being crushed
by increasing property taxes.
And so he's looking to work with some of the local
jurisdictions who are the ones who control property tax
for an area to see what they can do to reduce that burden
on Georgians.
But we don't have any specifics yet on that.
No, not yet.
We're hopefully this week.
We'll see some stuff unveiled.
And the Senate is taking a very different approach
to the tax relief.
Yeah, so talk about that a little bit.
Yeah, so Senate leadership is saying one of their priorities
is to reduce and eventually eliminate the income tax in Georgia.
We've seen it decrease the past few years,
and they're hoping for another big cut this year.
Yeah, and there was a study committee
over the summer led by Chairman Blake Tillery,
who was the appropriations chair and the Senate
to look at all of this,
and he has figured out a way to make that happen.
Talk about that.
IE has numbers.
I'm not sure if they'll all pencil out in the end.
You're gonna need a lot of revenue to make this happen,
but he has an immediate short term.
project of cutting eliminating the entire income tax for people and the first $50,000
basically and then an individual makes and that would cost about $3 billion in the first
half year which you know I think that we could swing that in with the current revenues but
then when it becomes a full year it'd be six billion bucks and so that's where they're going
to be you know starting to dig and he wants to go farther than that he also wants to take the
base rate down to 4.99 percent, which, you know, there might be broader enthusiasm for
that.
And one of the ways he wants to do all of this is by eliminating a lot of the tax breaks
that are out there.
Well, that would be part of the discussion in the future for some of the deeper digging.
Yeah, he's talked about, there's $30 billion in tax breaks on the books, but some of them
are for, you know, for the police benevolence fund or for schools.
But some of them also for data centers and for different corporations.
And so I think that there would probably be some enthusiasm for eliminating some of
those.
But I don't know if they can eliminate, you know, they would need 10% is what do you
remember the $3 billion for the other half of the six billion?
That's where he would get that, 10% of that 30 billion.
And he's talking about doing this like phasing it in up until 2032 up.
Well, that would actually be pretty immediate.
It would be January, it would be the next fiscal, well, the current, half way through
the current, the next fiscal year for the first half, the $50,000.
But then in the following fiscal year, it would be a full fiscal year.
So it would be $6 billion.
That's for the $50,000 alone income, your first tax bracket.
But they also want to reduce the overall, right now it's $5.19.
percent and they want to cut that to 4.99% and so that's more money and so
that's a lot in play and he wants to bring that down to zero in 2032.
The main thing is there's still a lot to do to get to the point where people can
say I have no more income tax there's still so people were thinking that's
going to happen right away it's not going to happen right away. Well and then
you have the speaker the house has an important role in the budget and the
speaker was asked and he's like well we're interested we want to see the
details. That's true. The math. Yeah. So let's get on to something else. Education is always a big area
for legislation and it looks like high school students may never, they may be losing access to their
phones in school. That's correct. We've seen it for the younger ones. Speaker Burns says that he's
hoping the house will pass a ban on suffans in schools for 9th grade through 12th grade.
And as you said, as you said, we've seen that ban for K through 8th grade already.
And so now they're discussing extending that to high school.
They feel like they've really seen a lot of benefits for kids and for teachers with this
K through 8th ban and they're hoping to see it keep going.
Okay, we'll see how that one goes.
But I think there's some popularity there where the parents, we didn't know how was going
to go for the 8th graders and younger, but it seems to be going well.
The Wellhust hog supper, which was last night, I talked to Democratic representative
Floyd Griffin of Millageville.
He has a push of legislation to repeal the promise scholarship.
It's a $6,500 voucher that an eligible family can use for things like tutoring or private
tuition.
on Amazon and, et cetera,
buying products that probably
didn't have anything to do with
them going to school.
There are some students going
into the private school,
and for whatever reason,
they are being their parents
are taking them out,
and they're going back to public
school. See, that money,
once it goes to the private
school, it does not come back.
So he is saying that the system right now
is being abused by some people,
even though he is pushing back on that.
The Republicans want to even increase
the promised scholarship in some way.
They haven't said yet, but there's some
who are looking either to increase the amount of money
or the number of students who can have eligible.
This has been on the agenda for years and years
and they finally did after some very squeaky votes.
they finally did get the voucher into law.
And yes, they're gonna want to expand it.
Senator Greg Dolezal, who is one of those senators
running for higher office for Lieutenant Governor,
is Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
So he'll have a say in the budget.
And he, this was his baby.
I mean, he's been pushing vouchers for years.
And so I wouldn't be surprised at all
if he would like to see either an increase
in the value of the voucher.
It's $6,500 right now.
or in the total appropriation.
So more students could participate.
And we always get the pushback on the other side
that this is hurting public schools.
Lawmakers are expected to revive some bills
that didn't make it through both chambers last year.
And Sarah, one of those is SB 30,
which would prohibit prescribing or administering
hormone therapies or puberty blocking medications.
Talk about that a little bit.
So this is an issue we've seen a lot of movement on
over the past few years.
Several years ago, we saw a ban on surgeries
hormone replacement therapy. This bill was originally intended to ban puberty blockers as well,
which are often given to transgender minors to prevent them from going through puberty.
But we've seen some amendments in the past year. It looks like now it's been watered down
and just add a bunch of additional requirements before they're able to prescribe those drugs.
And it passed the Senate, but it was stalled in the House last year. So we'll see if they pick it
back up. Yeah, we're expecting to hear that. Now, the wildhog supper, I also spoke to
representative Matt Reeves of Duluth.
He is taking the baton to once again,
once again, try to get a vote on sports betting.
We're not asking House members to implement this.
We're asking House members to let the people of Georgia vote
on this question of online sports betting
with the money going to literacy
and pre-K with the lottery.
Just last week during the peach ball
in the end, an organ came here to Georgia.
Both those states have legalized online sports betting.
they have a transparent, accountable with their lottery
and the money's going to education.
Not $1 in Georgia has gone to education
from online sports betting.
So Ty, is this the year the sports betting gets a vote?
Well, you know, all of this is like a big Rubik's Cube
when you get into the budget and you push here
and you have to pull there.
So something else we have is a hope scholarship.
It's very popular.
If people start spending their money on sports betting
instead of hope, that could have an impact on
impact on and that's a cherished you know that's a cherished fun so I think you
and obviously we've seen pushback from religious communities in the past so
you know I don't know could happen but this is a perennial issue yeah so there's
so much we didn't get a chance to touch on so we may have to have you back but
thanks so much for getting us started on the first day of lawmakers thank you
both for being here thank you so coming up we will take a look at the amazing
work done to glam up the gold dome. Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots
organization dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture. Farm Bureau
advocates for all Georgia farmers at the state capital during the session
and year round. Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia farmers.

Tune in to GPB.
It's a Georgia thing.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry.
When Georgia Lawmakers arrived today, they entered a freshly restored chamber.
Over this summer, dozens of workers updated technology, restored woodwork, and brought
historic details back to life, including shining Georgia gold.
Our GPB team got a behind the scenes look that included going to great heights.
We are at the top of the house chambers.
Top of the house chambers, so we've got a lot of the work that's been redone.
It's a rare close look at the intricate artistry and gilded touches at the highest point
of the house chamber.
you have the fine detail work in here. They were restored all this and then added some
more detail of adding gold into that.
We wanted a little Georgia gold everywhere, Georgia gold in here.
Up to and a half stories were standing atop a complex skeletal framework comprised of
tons of connecting pieces of steel, mass of scaffolding built on house floors so old
they needed showing up first.
The weight of the scaffolding is quite heavy, so we had to have a lot of engineering to
be done to make sure we didn't collapse this scaffolding to the bottom floor, so we replaced
all the flooring that's in the building.
There were still, we went back to the original timbers that were from the 1800s.
Refreshing every inch of the chambers required engineering precision, balancing preservation
with safety.
In that enormous wooden box.
This is our chandelier.
The chandelier will see downstairs as boxed up, protecting it.
It's been cleaned.
They're going to be putting new lighting in there.
Artisan's meticulously restored everything to its original neoclassical look of the late
1800s.
There have been over 60 painters that have just worked in this building.
We have artisan painters that are here doing the detail work.
They actually started on that detail work in their shop in New Haven, Connecticut,
last January. So they went through a selection process. There's probably three
historical painters in the United States that do that work.
Kind of a knob color and that's one of the store colors that has been in the
hair for a while. But it's been more pink. There's been a lot more pink. There's
more what we call it like a pepto bismal pink. That was an
brought in and so that was been more replaced with some of the ball.
The restorations not just cosmetic, it's comprehensive right down to the air
inside the building. They repaired plaster damage from the humidity in the building.
Originally, the domed ceiling opened up to let out hot air inside the chamber.
In the building and from the people discussing things. I would imagine there was quite
a bit of hot air. Now, the HVAC systems last time it was replaced in the late 50s.
So it was definitely needed to be done. So we're proud to have that and have good quality
air in here and try to maybe keep it a little bit cooler to keep
tempers down if they need to.
We leave the house.
We're in the Senate chambers.
So we started the restoration project in the House of Senate
Chambers back last May, or this past May.
And so we're wrapping up in here.
On this day, the scaffolding is gone,
and they're working on wiring and new carpet.
In here, there's new stain on the wood.
Every piece of wire has been pulled.
Every item has been either touched in some way.
We have new HVAC and air systems in the building,
handling that.
We have a new stain on the wood, new paint on the wall,
new gold in the gilded areas,
and the chandeliers have been cleaned.
They are putting new wiring in a building,
not built for the kind of electricity we use today.
When we ripped up the floors,
we were able to do new duck work throughout here.
So just in the Senate chambers there's over 36,000 feet of
cabling just in this small area that we have here and in the
house chambers there's over 76,000 feet of cabling in there.
Lawmakers will have better access to computers and phones with
USB ports and chargers at their desk.
And where are those desks on this day?
The desks are being restored down in the depot. We turn the depot,
the Georgia depot into a workroom. So we've been doing the
the restoration of the desk that had been on-site. We didn't let them leave state
properties so the workers have come in there to do that. Chairs were a little
bit more of a challenge. The chairs have far outlived their usefulness so we
actually have replica chairs that are coming in. Some of them are original
chairs from the turn of the century. Not the most recent turn of the century, the
one before those long ago 1990s. Now to the carpet. It's very similar to the
design of before. There's some modifications because I did not know this, but all the
carpets have copyright design on there. We've got this design. It's actually out of
Dalton, Georgia. So, Charles Carpet is our provider for that and very proud of what
they were able to produce for us. Georgia grown, of course. Contractors, architects
and craftsmen, many Georgia taxpayers themselves, treating the capital as a shared legacy.
just being part of this project,
this is more of a sense of pride
in giving back to the state.
They've all taken this as their ownership
and that they're all taxpayers here in the community
and they're proud of what they're doing
and you can just tell by the quality of work.
Modern systems carefully hidden,
now support a building first completed in 1889
that hadn't been restored in 30 years.
And even then faced challenges
under House Speaker Tom Murphy.
The story goes that they were going through
a pretty extensive renovation
and they had to cut off a few corners with them
because Speaker Murphy got tired of all the time it was taking
and so he told him to get out of this chamber.
So he was, that was one of the things
that Speaker Burns has been very helpful with us
to make quick decisions.
New ADA access, open committee rooms,
and redesigned stadium seating for the public.
This phase of restoration in the chambers began in May
after careful planning to finish everything
by the end of October.
What are you most proud of about this renovation process?
Being able to get it done in the timeframe that we have.
Preserving history, restoring dignity,
and preparing these revered historic chambers
for generations to come.
It was pretty cool to be up there
and actually touched the ceiling.
I can tell you that.
So you both were with Speaker John Burns
when he showed it all off.
So what did you, what did he,
He seemed very excited.
And he also announced today
that they did the entire project under budget,
which I know all the lawmakers loved.
But it was so interesting to see
the different intricacies of the designs.
You wouldn't notice just walking through there
and the significance of the DeLonica gold.
The carpet looks sort of like a Cherokee rose.
They would confirm that that's what the design was.
But of course, that's the state flower of Georgia.
So it was good to see all those details at close.
And the carpet was copied.
And the previous car, yeah, the previous car, but was copyrighted, so that was where.
You said you heard from some lawmakers, didn't you?
Yeah, and in the Senate, you can get up close and see them, you know, in their habitat.
And they were like kids in a toy store, like, apparently the chairs were pretty rickety
in the past, maybe even dangerous, and so they had musical chairs going on, so they'd
swap out if someone wasn't looking, so they could have the chair that works.
Of course, they're there for 40 days and nights, so they want something that works.
And yeah, I saw them inspecting their chairs,
kind of leaning back in them,
making sure they worked.
Yeah, I even got a text from one of the senators
of his USBC plug.
He loved it.
I loved it.
Thank you both for being here,
because that does it.
And for lawmakers today, we'll be back tomorrow
for Legislative Day 2.
Senate leaders from both parties
will join us to discuss their priorities.
And we will explore how the rapid developments
and artificial intelligence
are prompting new legislation this session.
Later this week, we'll have a one-hour show highlighting Governor Kim's annual State
of the State Address.
That's his last one.
We'll have the Democratic response also.
Have a good evening.
Keep sure to all my mind
I am safe
