Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 114th House District Representative Tim Fleming. Representative Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It's a great day in Georgia. It is my honor this morning to welcome to the State Capitol of my pastor, Pastor Chris Heymore. He is pastor of Wesley Methodist Church in Coveington, Georgia. He is a graduate of the University of Georgia. No dogs. Has several specialty degrees from Baudesta State University. His wife, Kai, and him have resided in New York County their whole life and have been married for 33 years. He is a retired educator. He's been in 33 years in the Georgia public schools, serving as a teacher, coach, administrator, and to his retirement last spring where he was principal of Mansfield Elementary School in Newton County. He has been a pastor in our church for the past year and a half since our church was founded. He, when he retired last year, he was not in his life plans to be a pastor. It's not something he sought out. Our congregation sought him out. We are grateful for him. Him pastoring us were grateful for his leadership and after his retirement last spring, he decided to join the ministry full time. With him today is his brother, Mr. David Heymore right here from Coveington as well. It's honor to have Pastor Chris Heymore today. So, Pastor, welcome. One thing Tim, Representative Fleming, forgot to tell you is that I'm also a big Atlanta sports fan, which acts is very good for me because the scripture tells us that we will be greatly rewarded for our suffering. I'm a speaker Burns, Representative Fleming, and all members of the George House representatives. It's an honor. It's a pleasure. It's a privilege to be here and I'm very humbled. I spoke with Representative Fleming the other day and asked him if I had a bio or a resume that I could send him that he could use today. My first thought was a resume. I'm retired. I have no use for resumes anymore, but I told him I'd jot some things down for him. I looked at the list I'd made and realized I'd spent the last 33 years of my life in education as a teacher, a coach, an principal, and I worked at the high school and elementary levels. It kind of got me thinking, you know, being a representative, working in the school system, and being a representative, there are a lot of similarities between those two. The first thing I noticed is when the speaker tried to call this room to order, it took me back to a kindergarten classroom. It's heard and cats is a phrase that we've used before. If you need some help, I've got the names of a couple of teachers that can get these folks in the shape. But let me ask you something. Let me ask you something. Has there been a day since you've been here in this position? Has there been a day that you said we did good work today? I did a great job today. This is something I'm proud of. I want you to see to leave this building and hear nothing but complaints from people outside of the chamber. Teaching's the same way. To profession which everyone wants to tell you how to do the job, but nobody really wants to come do it. And I know that you have people telling you constantly how you should do your job as well, but there are few who want to do the job. Like to sit and question and money morning quarterback. When what you do and what teachers do is take the information they have and make the best decision they can and doing what is right. Knowing what is right is easy, but doing what is right is courageous. There's another similarity and this perhaps the most important one that I find between teachers and your line of work. The teachers that I worked with got into teaching because they wanted to make a difference. They wanted to make things better. They wanted to affect change in the lives of the students who came into their classrooms. They came into the profession with a servant's heart. Having a servant's heart is living the life God wants us to live, giving for the benefit of others. In this way you're aligned with his will. CS Lewis said a servant's heart is the only way to be like Jesus. When I stand here and look out that's what I see today. I see a room full of servant hearts. I believe you came into this wanting to make a difference. You want to make this state better. You want to leave it better than you found it. You want to serve. Galatians chapter 5 verse 13 it says, You my brothers and sisters will call to be free, but don't use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead use your freedom to serve one another in love, freedom to word we hold dear. A servant's heart understands that although freedom gives us the ability to do what we want to do, it comes with the responsibility to do what we ought to do. A servant's heart. That's how Jesus Christ wanted us to live. Now if you allow me to close here with these words from Philippians to give you some encouragement. From now on brothers and sisters, if anything is excellent and if anything is admirable, focus your thoughts on these things. All that is true, all that is holy, all that is just, all that is pure, all that is lovely and all that is worthy of praise. Practice these things. Whatever you learn received heard or saw in us, the God of peace will be with you. Would you stand now and join me in prayer? Heavenly Father, when we come to you in prayer, the first thing we do is to give thanks. Lord, I give thanks today. I give thanks that I live in this state, in this country, and I give thanks to this body of servants here in front of me. They've chosen to do this work. I pray your blessings upon them. I pray that you will work through them so that your will may be done in our state and in our country. Lord, I pray your blessings upon their families. For during session there are so many, so much time that is spent away. Lord, I pray that you will be with them today, bring them back safely here tomorrow. In your name we pray, Amen. Now if you join me in the pledge of allegiance, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation on the ground, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you very much, Your Honor. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, members. You can join Brother Chris in the south any room for giving thanks for being here with us and get a photo. Brother Chris, thank you for that message. You were very encouraging, we appreciate that. Thank you. Our doctor of the day is Dr. Neal Tera Bhalkar and Dr. Bhalkar is brought to us by the chair lady Deborah Silcox. Did I get that pretty close? Close. We appreciate our physicians being here and serving the members if you need to see the physician, certainly they're down in the aid station. Chairman Hilton, you recognize Chairman of Information and Alderts, Chairman Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal the previous day and found it to be correct. Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audit, reports that the journal of the previous late study day has been read and found to be correct. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal, the chair here's done, the reading of the journal is dispensed with, is any objection to the confirmation of the journal, chair here's done and the journal is confirmed.

What many may not realize is that someone from right here in Georgia was on one of those helicopters. So I want or was on the helicopter. I want us to take a moment to honor the life of Ryan O'Hara, a dedicated crew chief on the Black Hawk helicopter and a proud 2014 graduate of Parkview High School in Lowburn. He was a four-year cadet in the Marine Corps Junior ROTC program at Parkview and he was finally remembered as the guy who would fix all the things around the ROTC gym. Shortly after graduation from Parkview at 18, Ryan joined the military and specifically chose the Army because it offered the opportunity to work on Black Hawk helicopters. Ryan's service to this country serves as a testament to his character, his courage, and his unwavering sense of duty. To his family, I offer my deepest condolences. You all are the greatest part of him in physical form. To his colleagues and arms, we stand with you in mourning and to all who knew him or were touched by his sacrifice, let's remember Ryan not in sorrow but in gratitude for his service and the impact he had on others. May we all continue to honor him by living with a sense of strength, dedication, commitment, and honor that Ryan displayed every day of his life. I would like to take a moment of silence.
