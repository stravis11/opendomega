All members will, please come to the floor.
All members, please come to the floor.
That's Clark, will you ring the bell?
All members, all members please come to the floor and take your seats.
We're about ready to kick Monday morning off.
The hour for convening having arrived, all members will please come to the floor and take
their seats.
Mr. Clerk, I think you've already rung the bell.
So we're ready, we're going to have the morning roll call, all members present will please
vote green to signify your presence in the chamber, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
All members are voted, I say you take your time.
All members voted.
If so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine, door keepers, you'll close the doors and keep
them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning has been with him many times, brotherly.
Oh a couple anyway many times and always brings a great message of devotion we appreciate
him. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 95th House District
represented Darshan Kendrax. Representative Kendrax.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues. The last time that Pastor Lee May from Transforming
faith church was here, he delivered a great message. In minutes after he got down from the
podium, I got an email that stated that all $179,000 of my student loans had been forgiven.
So no pressure pastor. I don't know what message you're bringing, but you can do it again.
But Pastor Lee May graduated from CAU and Emery University obtaining a master's degree in
theology and for over ten years his life has been about service.
He is the former owner of an eight screen movie theater in DeCabb County and in 2006
Pastor Lee May entered the world of politics by running for DeCabb County Commission in
Georgia and in 2013 he was appointed to be the chief executive officer for the
cab county. In both positions Lee was and still remains the youngest person in
either role in the history of the county. He's the son of a retired pastor and
in 2017 pastor Lee answered the call with his lovely wife Robin who swore me
in this term and transforming faith church was launched and he is the
constituent of the best district here in the state of Georgia, House District
95. So welcome my pastor, Pastor Lee May.
Good morning, good morning, good morning, and with that introduction there's no
pressure, right? Just about 176,000 I think she said. Yeah, it is always always
always good to be here in the Georgia State House of
Representatives. I don't take it lightly or for granted that
God has allowed me to stand on platforms like this and to
speak a word that prayerfully would be of some encouragement to
you in your role as men and women first, maybe as husbands and
wives, maybe as parents, fathers and mothers, and just great
leaders here in this state of Georgia. Again, my name is Lee
I am the pastor of Transforming Faith Church on the east side in the cab county in the city of Stonecress and yes
I do believe I have the best state representative in the nation. I just love us so much because
He's also a member of Transforming Faith Church and a faithful Thai member.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, let me get started in the remaining 45 minutes that I have with you.
I mean, I'm sorry, five minutes that I have with you all today. It is truly an honor and
a privilege to be here to you all. Good morning. You all good morning, Mr. Speaker. John Burns,
to all of the leadership, to our house delegation and the cab county and to all members here
of this great body and to all who were gathered here this morning.
It truly is an honor and a privilege to stand here before you and just really lean
into something that I ministered on yesterday.
Yesterday we had an opportunity to ordain three new deacons at our church, three deacons.
We were so excited about that and I communicated to the church that the word deacon in the new
Testament. I am a Christian pastor so I speak from that context in the New Testament of the Bible.
The word deacon in Greek means deaconos. That's the word deaconos. And it simply means servant.
I believe this morning I'm talking to a house full of deacons because you have signed up to be
servants of the people of God. You have signed up to serve people that look like you, talk like you.
You've signed up to be leaders of people that look nothing like you.
Share very little in common with you.
Yet we have all, you have all been called to serve God's people.
I preached yesterday from the book of James,
the book of James and the second chapter.
The book of James was written by none other than James.
Now for some of us this morning you may not know this,
but James was actually the brother of Jesus.
Can you imagine that? Your brother. Your blood brother is the son of the most high. He's the Messiah.
He's been called to save this world from the penalty of his sins, but he ended up following being a
follower of his brother after his death. And James was a leader of the church in Jerusalem. This
is just a little Bible study for you this morning. James was a leader of the church in Jerusalem,
and he would write letters of help, of recommendations,
how you ought to live your life as well.
And James penned this in James chapter 2, verse 17.
He says this, thus also, faith by itself,
if it does not have works is did.
He combined, he married two words.
He married faith and works.
He said, if you have faith, you can't help but have works in your life.
That means what you say you believe, what you say is your belief system,
your values, your core values.
You can say it, you can believe it all you want to, but if you're not living
it out in actionable ways, then really your faith might as well be dead.
Your might as well not even say you're a believer of whatever faith that you say
that you entrust in.
He says faith without words is dead.
And I know I'm speaking to a house full of people
that may share the same belief system.
You may have differing faith values as well,
but this is what I do.
I do believe in the goodness of humanity.
And in the goodness of humanity,
regardless of what your faith perspective is,
We are all called as humans to live out our core values
and to live it out in very actionable ways.
And so this morning, as we are living out our faith
through our actionable works,
I want to encourage us in this.
There's a proverb in Proverbs chapter 11 verse 14.
It tells us this, where there is no council,
the people fall.
but in the multitude of counselors, there is safety.
Look, wisdom, y'all, is found when leaders seek input.
Wisdom is found when you go and seek wisdom
from people that may share your same perspective,
but they may share a different perspective from you.
And this morning, I would just encourage us,
if you leave here with one thing, you'll say,
okay, I wanna make sure that every day
that as I'm living, as I'm serving, as I'm leading,
that I am living out my faith
in very practical and tangible ways.
But the second thing I want to encourage you all to do
is this, is to seek wisdom from others
that may not share the same perspective as you.
Because I would say that there is wisdom in all of us.
When we started our church, transforming faith church,
I took out every pastor that I could,
because I've done a lot of things in my life,
but I had never started a church before.
So I took pastor after pastor out to lunch
and said, hey, can you just share with me
your wisdom in launching your church.
Now, when I invited these pastors out,
I invited big pastors,
a big church's pastors who served smaller churches, pastors,
who I absolutely love their ministries, pastors,
who I didn't wanna duplicate anything that I saw them do.
I didn't want to do anything, no, but I did believe
that there was still value in the wisdom
that they could provide.
Would you all just think about that as you leave out
and do your work today?
Let me go, look across the proverbial political aisle
and say, hey, Mr. Democrat, Mrs. Republican,
Mr. Republican, Mrs. Democrat,
let me, let me, let's go to lunch and let's talk.
Let's talk about what I believe is our shared and joint goal,
which is to lead on behalf of the people of Georgia.
And can we figure out how we can work together
to establish, create legislation,
to strengthen legislation on the behalf
of all of God's people here on earth?
I think if we do that,
you all will literally live out the call
of the faith of your life.
And I believe that God would truly, truly be pleased
with your work here as servant leaders here in Georgia.
Well, that's all I got for you today.
May God bless you.
May God keep you.
May God forever smile upon you as well.
Now would you rise and stand with me as I pray
and then immediately following this prayer,
maybe we can do the pleasure of allegiance together.
Is that okay with you this morning?
God, we thank you.
We thank you that you have entrusted
so many people to serve your people through leadership.
God, we don't take it lightly or for granted
that even in this capital,
even in these halls of power God,
you've entrusted men and women
to lead on behalf of your children.
God, would you give supernatural wisdom
in each and every person here today?
God, as they would lead,
they would lead even beyond their capacity.
God, I pray that today that you would soften
that as people go about doing their work, God,
that they would reach out across the aisle
and say, how can we work hand in hand
on behalf of the people that you've entrusted us to lead?
God, would you bless all of the life circumstances
of everyone in this building?
God, would you bless their finances?
Would you bless their relationships?
Would you bless their career paths?
Would you bless their health?
God, bless everything that concerns them.
And God, I believe that your people will give you all the glory, all the honor, and all
the praise, because you have been a great, great God.
God, I pray this prayer in your Son, Jesus' name, amen, amen, and amen.
When we say the pledge of allegiance together, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible
with liberty and justice. God bless you all.
Thank you.
Now brother Lee you can't go the way yet if you had that kind of good fortune for
Representative Kendrick's there's a chair of appropriations right down there
Matt Hatchet. Chairman Hatchet I want you to circle up here with brother Lee if
we work on this budget. He's got that kind of strength and he's going to be
strong. Thank you brother Lee. Doorky but you may unlock the doors members you
You can join Brother Lee in the south any room.
Show him your appreciation of being here.
Our doctor of the day, today is brought to us by Chair Lady Katie Dempsey from up at
Rome of the 13th House District, District Dr. Brad Bushnell.

Representative Carl Gilear has recognized for a morning order.
Representative Gilear, give the gentleman in the wheel.
You're attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This morning, our past of the day
gave us a great inspiration of scripture.
And there's a scripture that says in the book of Revelation,
weeping me and do for a night, but joy.
But the book of Revelation talks about they shall hunger no more, neither should they
thirst anymore, for God shall wipe away every tear from their eye.
In 1859, there were 429 slaves that were as young as two weeks old, that were sold in
Savannah, Georgia.
It was the largest slave sale in America.
I come here today with great expectations
to thank the speaker of the house,
the Chatham County delegation,
and all the members of this general assembly.
Because there's another scripture that says,
weeping may endure for a night,
but joy comes in the morning.
And you all helped us pass House Bill 1425.
You helped us bring joy in the morning
to establish the weeping time heritage authority.
And today they're here.
It represents tourism.
It represents history.
But it represents healing.
And so we want to invite you out to Room 216.
Let us today break bonds of bread and eat together
and fellowship together and let us heal together.
216 lunch with the Weeping Times Heritage Authority.
Mr. Speaker, you're welcome.
Thank you, my friend, I appreciate your leadership on this issue and I encourage everyone
to go by 216 if you're here and celebrate with our friends from Savannah.
Representative Hong recognized for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'll be presenting a resolution to recognize today as topical steroid withdrawal symptom
awareness day.
Topical steroid withdrawal syndrome is a severe and debilitating condition that can arise
from intentional or unintentional exposure to topical steroids.
Topical steroids are usually prescribed and available over the counter to treat skin
conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Oftentimes and with prolonged use, when you
stop using these topical steroids, the body goes through a withdrawal and recovery can
take several months to several years. Some people are bed ridden for several years,
they can't work, they can't go to school, they can't take care of children. I want to

Now you're ready.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, my colleagues.
We stand to recognize that today is Georgia PTA.
A day here at the capital at the people's house.
This is an organization that continues to stand
for the support and rights of our students
throughout this state.
They are many together, but they are one in unity
as we continue to move our students
to be the best in this nation
and then to return to our state to be the best in this state.
So they've asked today that we will continue
to look at funding our schools through our FTE and our QBE.
And today, we say to you, our response
is that we want the best for our students,
and we will continue to do that.
So the president, Dana Shanda Ross,
is here with us, President Elect,
and two former presidents of the Georgia PTA.
So we can stand and just give them a hand of applause
for the work that they do all around Georgia.
Thank you, Representative Glaze.

In order to represent Carter, represent Carter has a moment in black history.
Represent during, Carter.
If you give the lady in the will, your attention please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It is an honor to stand before you today as we celebrate black history and the remarkable
contributions of those who paved the way for us.
Among these trailblazers is the incomparable,
Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a scholar, historian,
and visionary who dedicated his life
to ensuring that black history was recognized,
respected, and preserved.
Born in 1875 to formerly enslaved parents,
Woodson understood the power of education.
He became only the second African-American to earn a PhD
from Harvard University.
But despite his achievements, he saw
that the rich history of black people
was being ignored in schools and textbooks.
He knew that people without knowledge of their past
could never fully claim their future.
In 1926, he launched Negro History Week,
which later evolved into black history month.
A time to reflect on our heritage,
honor our ancestors and inspire future generations.
But Woodson's vision was greater than a single month
of recognition.
He believed black history should be studied
and celebrated every day.
Today, we continue his mission, not just remembering
the past, but ensuring that the stories of black excellence,
resilience and achievement are woven
into the fabric of American history.
His legacy calls to educate and power
and uplift our communities.
So as we honor Cardigee Woodson,
let us commit to keeping history alive,
not just in February, but all year long,
because black history is not just our past.
It is our power.
Thank you, I yield the will.
Thank you, Representative.
Representative Tony Miller.
Representative Miller.
If y'all will give the lady to wear your attention, please.
