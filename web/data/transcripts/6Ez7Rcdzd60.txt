TRANSCRIPT
----------
Get a little quiet out there. It's getting a little loud in here. I know we got some anxious folks and
First off let me start by saying
If you have already come here and presented your bill, you do not need to do it again
If you won't tell you can
But for sake of time if you have already presented your bill, you do not need to go again
So if anybody has other things they want to do or need to do, feel free to leave and exit
now.
Seeing none.
Well, for all y'all standing, I tried to help you out.
Now, another rule, since this is rules committee, I like rules.
As you present today, you do not need to come back.
We'll hold one more rolls committee.
It will either be tomorrow night or it will be Friday morning.
That's going to be kind of dependent on the Senate schedule tomorrow.
We're going in at 1 o'clock tomorrow and depending how fast we move through bills,
we'll kind of determine when rules will meet.
And I'll make that decision fairly early in the day.
So rules committee, y'all just stand by.
We're really going to meet early evening tomorrow
during a recess, or we will meet at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
And again, house members, if you present today,
you will not need to come back and present again.
Or if you have already presented,
you do not need to come back and present again.
Now, for you house members that are new to this,
Under normal circumstances, I make the bills available.
So that is the yellow sheet you're looking at.
Those bills are available for the committee to be picked.
But the committee numbers are the ones that pick the bills.
Again, that's under normal circumstances.
Today is going to be an exception of that rule,
because I'm actually going to set the calendar
tomorrow with about 17 bills.
and then the rest, when we come back in,
rules committee members, you're gonna have about two to three,
possibly even four picks, when we come back in,
either tomorrow night or Friday morning, okay?
So just giving everybody a heads up.
So House members, lobby the committee members.
Lobby them, because they are the ones
that will pick your bills outside of today.
I'm gonna pick them today,
because there's a lot of department bills we're trying to get on the floor
tomorrow so they don't get caught up and cross over and a few other bills
we're trying to get on the floor tomorrow so I'm sorry for signing by signing
die all right so that's kind of the groundwork so let's go through first we're
going to we're in standing committee all right we're going to briefly go
We're going through our study committees.

time deviation. See how much money you owe, Mr. Chairman.

All right, Senator Halpern, SO 186. If you'll go to the podium.
This is a Senate resolution just in honor of the day at the Capitol for the Democratic
Women Federation of Democratic Women.

Senator Alvers.
Standing Georgia's workforce.
I was looking to make your head when I had a chair here.
I would have taken it.
All right.
Senate Resolution 279, Senator Dolezal.
What's that?
Oh.
All right.
Senator Resolution 282, Senator Kirkpatrick.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
This is a study committee on foster care and adoption.
I like it.
All right, Senate Resolution 286, Senator Beech.
Yeah, this is to create a study committee to look at minority business, women, business, and
veteran owns, but I will tell you, we have House Bill 128 on the calendar, which really kind of has done this.
So do we need to pull this off?
Yeah, I mean, there's no need for it if House Bill 128 passes to Representative Long's Bill.
Assuming it gets picked.
If it gets picked and passes, then we would not need this study committee.
We're moving on for now.
Okay.
All right.
Senator resolution 293, Senator Halperen.
Okay.
In fact, you got 293 and 296, go ahead and cover them both please.
293 is a study committee that would look at an equity impact tools and it would just
look at equity impacts and what we might be able to do as it relates to legislation.
This is, here equity you think raised generally, but this really is looking at disparities
and it could also be impacts and unintended consequences
on our rural areas versus urban.
About 296.
And 296 is a subject.
Not to cut you off, but I'm going to cut you off.
296, excessive noise.
We still have an issue with loud mufflers, loud music.
And so this would be figuring out what the state could do
to help our people solve this.
And in this room.
Can we have this room?
Yes, but that's it.
Everybody's behaving nicely.
All right, thank you, Senator.
Senator Matarte, 314.
Mike number one, 314 is a Solar Study Committee
and apologize I was late.
Senator Resolution 155 was a trucking and
sort of study committee.
My car is on the right.
Thank you.
All right, Senator Resolution 323.
Family caregivers, Mr. Chair.
All right.
Senator Resolution 354.
Mayor Wanda, Mr. Chair.
Mayor Wanda, what are we studying?
What are we studying with it?
We're studying the impacts, the negative impacts
of the use of Mayor Wanda, especially recreational Mayor Wanda.
We'll be working with the FDA
and the Centers for Disease Control.
Gotcha.
All right, so here's what we could do if it's the will of the committee we can pass this onto a local consent calendar if there's any resolution any study committee anyone wants to pull off they can make that motion once we have a motion on the table for the consent calendar or is there any actually before I make is there anyone that would like to pull one off for individual consideration?
Okay, all right, which one's what's your number there for?
It's in one of the most important ones.
It's and I don't see it in front of us.
It's a study committee on study committees.
Have you looked at it?
If we adopt all of these, we'll be here all year.
You don't have to serve on all of them.
I know, but if anything you'd like to pull off,
now would be the proper time to do that.
And then we will vote on those individuals.
We go to make each one individually or just do it.
We just did.
We are going to pass on to a local consent calendar
of resolutions creating study committees.
Anything you would like to pull off of that consent calendar
now would be the proper time.
And I will take that motion.
And then we will have an individual vote on each.
each, Senator Diggin, you have a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, number two.
Number two.
So if we pass it to a local consent calendar,
we can still challenge on the floor
to have it removed from the local consent calendar
and vote for it individually.
All right.
I said local consent calendar.
It's just a consent calendar, but my understanding is,
that we could do it, we could do it on the floor as well,
but since we're getting,
I would pull off as many as you can at this point,
if that's what you want.
trying to say if you see something but yes you're saving time now but we're
going it's going to hurt us later yes question center albers thank you
Mr. Chairman are we in the standing committee we're in the standing committee at
this time so isn't it true if we pass all these they still then have to go and
be redone for a consent on the rules committee once their passes and that
true that is we have another step to do still that is correct they would pass
out they would go to the rules calendar so if we just pass these now we'd have
some time before you put them into the rules committee to figure out which
We might want a moment. They're going to be in the rules committee as soon as we get out of standing, which is going to be momentarily
I'm sorry it will be tomorrow
Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm learning the rules too
All right
What is the will of the committee?
Ah chairman Walker
I have a parliamentary inquiry.
Okay.
Is it not true that even if we were to pass all of these on the floor of the Senate,
it's still at the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor whether or not to appoint the committee.
You know, you being a former four-lative Lieutenant Governor, you would know that best.
And I think that is a great point to bring up to the committee.
All of these to be appointed up. I wouldn't it be unusual
Fair enough to keep that mind committee now back in my
Regional question. What's the world committee? I got a motion do pass to the consent calendar of resolutions
Creating study committees. I've got a second any further discussion
I'm sure you know what to do.
All right, all right, keep them up.
We'll get a count.
We're going to have some of what we got.
Yeah, he's getting the shaper wave left hand count to
All right, all the pays raise your hand
Gachandolls all the riff raff for the Senate
Which one are you riffing he's raff?
I just didn't want to.
All right, motion passed.
All right, this meeting is adjourned.
New meeting is start.
Wait, what?
D pass.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What?
Resolution 186.
I'm sorry, meeting was not adjourned.
That was a false alarm.
We did not have Senate Resolution 186,
commending the Georgia Federation a Democratic woman.
That one actually is separate because it's not a study committee.
What is the world of committee?
You got a motion do pass from Senator Robertson and second
from Senator Dugan.
All in favor?
Say aye.
All opposed?
Same sign?
Motion passes unanimous.
Those will all go on to Rolls Committee tomorrow
All right, thank you all right now means adjourn and we will call this next meeting to order
We are now in rules and we will go to the general calendar and
Rules consideration calendar your yellow sheet
House members. Thank you for being patient
I tell you what, let's just say we're standing, are representative towns, you want to hop up there?
Yes sir.
Tell us what bill and what page.
It's House bill 181.
It's LC339513S.
Basically this is a constituent base bill on a plant-based product called Cratern.
It's right now, it's not safe for Georgians.
It's when you buy it off the shelves of a convenience store
in front of the counter, you're not sure what you're getting.
It could be a low-dose, high-dose.
We've had two bad reactions.
I know her recently in St. Simon's,
and one actually committed suicide,
because he was on that and other drugs.
Second one actually used it in a half-way house.
Is that a lonely bill?
181, yes sir, 181.
Okay, thank you.
Any questions for the author?
Thank you.
Great job.
Rivers and Corbett, I know you got another meeting.
If you don't go ahead, hop up there, trying to be accommodating.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Committee, House Bill 81, first page.
The base we're doing here, we're just helping some schools that would not be able to qualify
for this low wealth project-specific grant that's in code now.
What was the board member?
81.
LC 491061.
All right.
All right, but we're changing criteria once once a system needs have been met
They're roll off of that list and allow the next school to roll on qualify for this grant
All right any questions for the author. Thank you. Thank you
Let's see represent my home. Did you I think you're chair in a committee or something?
Go ahead, Sherry. Thank you, mr. Chair. I have house bill 128 LC 36 5 3 8 7 dash EC this
This stream lines to state business certification process by taking out the federal certification
process requirement and it will also add women in businesses and veteran in businesses
to the state certification process.
All right, thank you.
Representative Cooper.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have two bills for consideration.
The first one is House Bill 309, it's the bottom of the third page and this is a department
request. It clarifies what CPAs can do when evaluating whether somebody thinking
about opening an assisted living facility has the financial backing and
security to do so. Okay, what was your other one? 470? Yeah, yes sir.
All right, fourth page, three fourths the way down. Thank you sir. This is one
that perhaps made the capital shake last week. We had agreement between the
The trial lawyers, the hospitals, the doctors, the insurers, it's a new way, just one small
way of doing something differently in trying to resolve in a positive way when patients
have unintended unexpected consequences happen to them without involving the legal system.
It's totally voluntary between patients and the hospital or the doctor and the hospital
one. That's what it is. I'll be glad to answer questions.
Any questions for the author? Thank you. All right.
Representative Taylor, come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I bring you House Bill 317.
This is a bill that has to do with the retirement plan for some, it's an old plan that the
state has. And for some reason, they did not allow an assignment of life insurance benefits
to the funeral home. And funeral homes have been left without their
bill being paid and this allows them to accept an assignment for the funeral expenses.
317 is not on the yellow sheet but she can go ahead and present one of the
issues were because it is a pension plan but once the beneficiary once the
employee has deceased it's the beneficiary's money so the state as we leave
they're doing what the beneficiary wants and assigning the benefits. Thank you
Thank you.
Questions for the author.
Thank you.
Representative Ballinger.
Go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I don't know if I'm on the yellow sheet or not.

protection order to be given to the respondent.

I'm just adding a basically a family family violence act to that burglary statute any questions for the author. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
This is House Bill 294 by Senate Committee Substitute.

So they could create a municipal court clerk certification program.

The second part of the bill clarifies the law that the legislature can only reapportion
county commission districts.
And the other part of the bill just says that if you're in a county commission seat for

Dr. Nguyen, come on up.
Sir Mr. Chairman, I have two bills that came out of,
substituted out of Senate Finance,
House Bill 308, LC-432813S now.
That's a bill to continue a program that's worked well,
real well, training our PA's nurse practitioners
and medical students by using a physician,
a tax credit for a preceptor who's willing to take them on
for a month at a time, this bill currently,
this process will currently expire
for all our Georgia schools into this year
if we don't renew it.
so it would be very valuable to our medical
and PA in nurse schools.
All right, is that all you got?
I got one other, House Bill 230,
also a bill that came out of Senate Finance Substitute,
LC-432803S.
That bill recognizes the consolidated government
on the border of South Carolina
for a regional project on arena
that we want to rebuild in place
and that allows us to, through a sales tax,
half penny sales tax, it allows us to get money
from those out of state that will enjoy
benefit of that arena. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
A fellow vice chairman gains. Come on up. How are you, Mr.
Vice Chairman? Good, Mr. Vice Chairman. How you doing?
Great. Good to see you. Good. Thanks for having me.
Yeah. I'm honored to have you.
Good. Got two bills that on the yellow sheet House Bill 88,
which is the top of page two. And this is Coleman Baker Act allows
for re-investigation of co-case homicides and allows for
reporting of co-cases and for coroner's issue, non-specific homicidal means of death,
trying to address several issues related to co-case homicides, and then also on the
bottom of page to House Bill 185, which would provide tuition grants that we have included
in the budget for students with intellectual disabilities who attend what are called
the IBC programs, UGA and colleges throughout the state,
Georgia Tech, Georgia Southern.
And so that allows students with intellectual disabilities
for tuition funding,
because currently they're not eligible for hope.
I mean, I did have House Bill 528
that I think was on the yellow sheet.
I'll just mention, but I think it's no longer on there.
That allows for consumers to,
who subscribe to something online, automatic renewal.
They'll make sure they can also cancel that subscription
online so you don't have to call and sit on hold and wait in order to cancel a
subscription okay thank you any questions thank you thank you thank
Ms. Vice Chairman yes sir come on up represent me how are you doing great
Mr. Chairman how about you today doing well thank you for the opportunity to be
here on top of page three is House Bill 189 Mr. Chairman is being brought from
the Senate Transportation Committee as a substitute the language was brought
for by both Chairman Dolezal and leader Gooch.
Many of you may know, under both the last three years,
we've had the opportunity to operate it at 95,000 weight
exemption by executive order of the governor.
That exemption has expired.
So what this bill does allows for a 10% variance,
for a total of 88,000, for forestry and agriculture only,
restricts the miles traveled to 75 radius of the farm,
or wherever the point of origin is,
grants local law enforcement the ability to weigh trucks,
if they have scales and restricts the trucks from entering the non-attainment area around
Metro Atlanta area.
All right.
Is that your only bill?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We're representing Verbal.
Come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
There are two bills of mine here on your list.
On the first page, House Bill 87 there is our completion school bill continuing with
three of our current programs, which is Mount Ned,
foothills, and coastal plains, and also setting up seven
zones in the state for like type drop out prevention
schools to be set up working with our nontraditional
schools. All right, what else? And the other is 338, which
is a bill that we heard last year here in rules also is a
filtering bill for handheld devices devices that children
are issued through their schools,
filtering it for inappropriate material
and trying to keep pornography off of those items
and securing them.
Okay, any questions?
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Washington, come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm presenting a Senate Committee substitute
to House Bill 514.
It deals for moratoriums on residential construction.
It does not allow moratorium for longer than 180 days
except under some specific conditions.
Also does not allow the imposing of the new moratorium
for another 180 days.
Also limits permitting fees to the cost of administration
of the permitting process.
Lastly, it allows local government to waive some fees.
Allows doesn't require them to waive fees to incentivize residential construction, and that is the bill.
All right, any questions for the author?
Thank you.
Representative Silcox.
Come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have four bills.
The first two are department bills.
The first one is for Chairman Tyler Paul Smith.
House Bill 475 is the annual code revision to revise and modernize the code.
Modernize the code.
The second bill is for the Department of Human Services.
That's House Bill 571, and it's going to ask the Georgia Alzheimer's and
related dementia state plan advisory council to update our statistics related to
Alzheimer's and dementia every two years and give a report, official report every four years.
The third bill is House Bill 416, and this is since the federal emergency is expiring on May 11th.
This is going to allow our pharmacies to still utilize pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines only.
Those vaccines would still be dosed by the pharmacist.
But this would allow them, like I said, to use the pharmacy technicians going forward.
And finally, I have House Bill 500, which would make it a crime to set a police vehicle on fire.
And those are the four bills.
So it's not a current crime set of vehicle on fire?
It is a crime to destroy government property, but this would make it a felony to do so to a police vehicle, and it would be a fine of $100,000 and or three to 20.
All right, let's get a little order in here. We've got a lot to do, a little time to do it.
I already have questions for the author. Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on, let's represent representative Sharon Henderson, HP 384.
It's not on your list, however, HP 384 prostate cancer is the second meeting cause of death
in Georgia among men.
This year alone, almost 9,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and over 800 lose
their battle to prostate cancer. This will simply as insurance companies to send notifications
to men upon reaching age 45 to have a PSD test done which would diagnose the level of PSA
that they have. Early detection is key. Early detection saved lives. And this is simply
all this world does. It detects early detection and save lives in the state of Georgia. Thank
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, no questions.
You're good.
Come on up.
Thank you, Chairman Brash.
Thank you, members committee.
I got two bills.
Got House Bill 143 is the continuous glucose monitors.
We're going off a substitute, changing it from medical pharmacy to most cost effective method.
So that's the only change in House Bill 143, I think we've heard this several times.
Okay.
Okay.
The second one is House Bill 498, Spinal Directors, Laps, License, Ten Years, Lapsed.
They can get them reinstated by meeting certain criteria.
All right, any questions?
Sir James no questions thank you sir parent do you have something you have
something to present okay what you got hand her mic nine there please
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members, this is our 250 number one on the first
I mentioned that urges the city of South Fulton at East Point to form a hospital authority.
They have an opportunity to do that and because of the well-star South Fulton hospital closing,
and people in Heyville, East Point Coast Park,
the United City Fairburn Palmetto,
Chattahoochee Hills, and Southwest Atlanta.
Don't have access right now to a hospital.
And we have the, we have.
Why don't they have access?
What was it that closed?
Excuse me?
What, what closed nearby?
The only thing nearby is greater hospital and that.
Which one closed?
the South Fulton East Point Regional Center.
Okay.
And then the AMC probably didn't help either.
And then the AMC closed, too.
Who manages that?
A well start.
That's right.
Yeah, it's under.
All right.
So it's nothing against well start.
We just have people who know who need it.
They need an authority in order to get the bonds, but we have funding available.
But we have to have either a hospital or a party or some other
the governor or somebody to ask for it.
Thank you.
Right.
Now, I apologize for not calling on you.
I didn't see you.
You never went on the list right there, and I didn't see it.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
OK.
Revolution of Jenkins.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Cahida Delegates.
Yes.
Good to have you.
Glad to be here.
have two bills for you this afternoon.
House bill 132 on the second page,
which I have previously presented,
relating to graded lumber.
So we won't talk much about that.
Next.
House bill 254 is my second bill.
This bill pertains to legal organ.
It's an organ, it's a three-part bill.
The first part makes it changes the criteria
for selecting a legal organ.
This is aimed primarily at our rural counties
who may have lost their legal organ.
The second part of this bill,
adjust ad rates, it actually increases
the legal notice rates for inflation.
Then the third part of the bill is basically,
if the legal organ fails to publish a legal notice
that it was running the paper,
this allows electronic means to back that process up
and proceed without interruption so that we can continue
processes without delay.
All right, in question for the author.
Thank you.
Great job.
Thank you.
Representative Hilton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, distinguished members here
to present to you House Bill 219.
If you turn to the top of page number three,
House Bill 219 provides victims of financial crimes
with justice by changing the venue
from where the assets reside to where the victim is.
I got another one. Two more. Turn the next page. Top of page four. House Bill 318 removes
the redundancy in state government by removing responsibility for the oversight of state
and local charter schools to one agency of the State Charter School Commission here in
Georgia. Okay, what's your third one? Third one, not on there yet, but House Bill 453 removes
an ambulance provider fee that's been paid for the better part of 20 years without matching
reimbursement. Okay, thank you. Thank you, sir. All right.
Representative, come on up. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I have, I believe it total of six bills. I've looked at the sheet. I think three of them are
on there. House Bill 80, which I presented a few days ago. I'm 500. I ain't bad.
House Bill 80, I presented a few days ago and I'm assuming you don't wish to hear that again.
Nope.
All right.
Then House Bill 220, without getting into the legalities of it, it basically would require
HOAs and condominium associations to go to court first before they go on to property
to cure any kind of deficiencies.
And then House Bill 227 creates a new crime of damage to critical infrastructure.
It makes it a subset of criminal damage to property.
And the first degree increases the penalty.
This is for folks who damage power substations and things like happen in North Carolina
back just before Christmas.
Okay. Any questions? Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Come on down.
Good afternoon. I have House Bill 43, which is on the top,
near the top of the first page on the yellow sheet.
This bill is requested by our Council on American Indian Concerns
and our three state recognized tribes.
It number one updates the addresses for those three state recognized tribes
so they can properly be found and two ensures that those tribes
have representation on our council which is under DNR.
Cool. Any questions? Are you in a tribe?
No, I'm not. Certainly we should be supportive of them and am.
Yeah, obviously. I was just checking.
Thank you. You said we are tribes. I just wanted to.
I was just curious. We're all part of some tribe. That's exactly right.
Thank you. Some we don't want to be part of.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Bring you today's substitute to House Bill 244.
This is a Department of Natural Resources Bill.
You don't need to worry about it a bit,
because it came through Senator Lee Anderson's committee,
which means it's thoroughly vetted.
And this bill is about four years ago,
I carried the Oyster-Merry Culture Bill.
Most of this is some improvements there related to defining cages
for new technology with growing oysters.
We also have some language in here allowing the governor
the governor to replace board members like they do in other boards across the state.
And we actually also in here allow, as you'll notice, electronically calling Fox and Bob
Cat in this state as during hunting season for those species.
Okay.
So your oyster bill, the original oyster bill, if I remember correctly, at a house member
test five against it and if I remember the number right, he kept saying 37 members
and the House voted against it.
I can't remember that, I can't remember that.
I know we had a member on the coast to actually
oppose that measure.
Well he was basically enough.
I had to remind him 37 wasn't enough.
Yes, that's right, not quite enough.
It's a good bill, and by the way,
anybody interested, we are only awaiting the Corps
of Engineers approval.
Federal bureaucracy is the only thing keeping us
from farming oysters in Georgia at this very minute.
We're still waiting, and we have been for quite some time.
All right, well thank you.
Thank you Chairman.
All right.
Representative Dempsey.
Come on up.
My mama would be enjoying this if she was watching.
In fact, maybe.
Maybe she can go back and watch us, OK?
She'd probably watch it, actually.
Just her buys information.
I was in high school with the chairman's mother.
We graduated together.
And I was in college with her daughter.
Yeah, and I'll work down in it.
Yes.
Here we are.
So here we are today.
Page three, the fifth one down.
The Senate substitute to HB228, this is a great opportunity
for several of our colleges and a university
that were not eligible for tuition equalization grants
back in 2011 when 33 schools were grandfathered
in to that program.
It allows in section two, it allows for two HBCUs
to be considered, Penn College and Mars Brown College
in section three, South College, which was
Senator Burns bill that passed out of here and was just being heard again over in House
Higher Education. And then in section four is the underlying bill for Chamberlain University.
They each address critical shortages in our state to help with the education process
as well as particularly the nursing shortage. So, my whole takeaway from your presentation
was I heard you saying the house is actually taking up some of our bills, so I'm glad
We are and I I mean, I'm just like I'm here. I will tell you this at Senator Burns came to pitch this to y'all
Because we didn't have a quorum and then the quorum was reached at that moment
So we're looking out for you. Yes, he yelled at us. Yeah, okay as usual. Okay. Thank you
Representing raise come on up
Thank you chairman brass members of the rules committee. I'm here to present House Bill 383 the Safe or Hospitals Act
This bill came through Chairman Watson's Committee and was passed unanimously.
This bill puts all hospital employees on par with emergency room workers in terms of
protections from assault and battery.
It also allows all hospitals in the state to form a hospital campus police department
like some hospitals currently have the ability to do through grandfathering or through being
affiliated with the college.
Respectfully request approval of House Bill 383 and then three bills which I presented
previously just to recap those and respectfully request
approval of House Bill 182.
That is the State Bar of Georgia's commercial real estate
bill and some other mortgage and title insurance matters.
House Bill 444.
The Liz Pendence Bill to give clear title to real estate.
And a department bill House Bill 572,
the State Ethics Commission Bill,
which formally renames the State Ethics Commission,
the State Ethics Commission.
Thank you.
Okay, for the bill.
Thank you.
Any questions about state ethics?
Being named State Ethics.
Thank you, Representative, for bringing this.
What was the State Ethics Commission called
before it was called the State Ethics Commission?
15 years ago, it was the State Ethics Commission,
and now it is a tongue twister
the Georgia transparency and accountability,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
That's, thank you.
And just, nobody can say it five times faster.
I'm just glad we've passed so many laws in 15 years
that we're going back to starting all over again,
I appreciate it.
There are a few things that Mr. Amadi requested
that are technical cleanups also in the bill,
important legally and the committee recommended it
unanimously.
I got, I was just picking on you, go ahead.
Thank you.
All right, everything's advanced, come on up.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman,
it's house bill 396 that is not on your yellow sheets,
but it passed out of Chairman Anderson's committee.
week or so ago and all it does is add the president of Georgia College of
State University and or designate to the Georgia, excuse me, the O'Coney River
Greenway Authority. Okay, any questions? Thank you. Thank you sir.
Representative LaHood, come on up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to present.

Pino institutions. Pino institutions. Yes, thank you. You can say Pino. Well, I wasn't sure. I
Didn't want to offend anybody
And also in section two it removes and barriers to to becoming a certified nurses assistant and
Both the Department of Corrections and the Department of Community Health are supporting the bill all right any questions for Chairman Lehood
Thank you. All right. Thank you
Then, come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee.
I'm here today presenting House Bill 306,
which deals with performance contracting
for local governments.
It's on the bottom of page three, I believe.
And it's provided for performance contracting
for local governments and school boards.
It has three things in a line's title 20,
with title 50.
Provides a performance contract,
can be based off the revenue generation measures.
And then three, just simply defines
what a facility is as in code.
Question from my vice chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
How long are those contracts in play?
So the contract depends once it goes through the bidding process, the local government.
I mean, it could be a year, depending on the procurement process that the local government
uses.
A performance contract could it be extended to like ten years?
Yes, sir.
Because it pays for itself over the term of the contract.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Another question.
Thank you.
It's not on the sheet, but House Bill 269 passed out of government oversight on Monday.
It's regarding workforce development boards and allowing them to meet via teleconference.
Okay.
I'm making note of that.

settles on all those proceeds shall be appropriated by the general assembly?
All right.
Any questions?
