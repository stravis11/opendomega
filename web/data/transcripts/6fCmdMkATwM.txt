>> Thank you, Madam Pro. It's an honor to
be here today on this beautiful Monday
morning. And colleagues, it's truly a
pleasure to introduce Billy Smith,
pastor of Christ Chapel Church in
Zebulun, which he serves in West Central
Georgia. And the church has eight
beautiful campuses. Pastor Billy is
known for his servant leadership, strong
faith, and his genuine heart for people.
Under his leadership, Christ Chapel has
done tremendous things through outreach
and volunteer efforts, meeting real
needs, strengthening families, and
making meaningful different uh
difference across our communities.
Beyond his ministry, Billy is the proud
father of four beautiful children and
the loving wife, loving husband to his
wife, Tina. He leads through humility,
speaks with conviction, and serves with
consistent consistently. I am very
pleased to call Billy Smith my friend.
He is always there. I've reached out to
him many times over the years just
needing to have a sounding board to hear
his opinion. He's always very kind and
very generous in that. And so this
morning, I'd like to introduce Pastor
Billy Smith. Thank you.
>> Good morning, everybody.
I was told years ago uh by an older
pastor, he gave me some advice. He said,
"He who is short- winded shall be heard
again." Uh, so if you want to share that
with your pastor for Sunday services,
that'll be fine. Thank you,
Representative Camp, for the invitation
today. Uh, she represents our district
so well. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for
the opportunity. Uh, I can do three
points in three minutes if you can
listen fast. How about that? We'll make
a deal right now. Faith that lasts.
Faith that lasts. Point number one,
faith has to believe when it can't see.
Often in the Christian faith, uh God's
asking us to step out and do things that
we can't really see how it's going to
turn out. We'd like to face situations
that have obvious answers, but they're
not always so obvious. Sometimes the
bills stack up, our health has a shift,
uh we have a relationship that's
stretched or strained, and life doesn't
always just give us what we ask for.
Hebrewsap 11:1 says, "Faith is confident
in what we hope for and the assurance of
what we do not see." Uh, and let's be
honest, some of you here are my age or
older. There's a few of you maybe
younger, but I have these things I call
cheaters. These are reading glasses.
Most of you have those. We probably have
25 pair at my house. We can't find them,
but we have 25 pair. And last week, I
was walking around the house looking for
a pair, and I went into the bathroom. I
thought maybe I left them on the counter
there and they weren't there. But I
looked over the sink in the mirror and
they were on top of my head. I don't I
know none of you have ever done that
before. But even even sometimes when God
doesn't seem near, our our faith seems a
little bit lost. He's always close. Even
if we don't see him, if we don't feel
him, he's always near. So faith believes
when it can't see. Point number two,
faith obeys when it doesn't understand.
And sometimes God just asks us to do
stuff that doesn't seem to have a clear
explanation. We like timelines and
guarantees in life, but that's not what
faith is about. Uh faith rarely comes
with a blueprint. James says it this way
in scripture. He says that faith without
works is dead. It requires us to do
something. Uh sometimes God's
instructions feels a little bit like a
GPS system. The navigation in your car.
Uh, I'm from a hour and a half south of
here, hour and 10 minutes south of here,
and I'm in a rural area. And sometimes
when the GPS uh tells me to go in a
certain direction, I get confused
because it sends me through a corn field
or it takes me down an old dirt road.
And you know what I found out though?
Typically that GPS gets me where I'm
supposed to go if I'll just follow it.
Even though I don't understand the
steps, sometimes if I'll just follow, I
get where I'm supposed to be. And it's
like that with our faith. Often Noah in
the Old Testament was building a boat. a
crazy size boat with limited
instructions. But his faith just allowed
him to continue to build. Even though he
didn't understand all the pieces yet,
his faith in God was strong. Point
number three, faith endures when it
wants to quit. I don't know about you
guys, but there have been a few moments
in my life, few times that I felt like
throwing the towel in. I felt like
quitting. Uh I have board meetings as
well with Christian men usually and
women. And uh you would think that would
always turn out well, but sometimes it's
difficult. It's hard sometimes and
somebody giggled because they've been in
one of those recently, right? We all
sometimes want to quit. Um, it's easy to
be excited about things in the
beginning, but I like people who finish
stuff. At the at the first of the year
this year, we know that gyms, local gyms
had a uh had record numbers of people
sign up to get in shape. Uh, some of you
may have signed up to get in shape. Uh,
the third Friday of January is called
National Quitters Day, in case you're
wondering.
The road to hell is paved with good
intentions, right? And but faith needs
to be something that helps us finish
this journey that God's given us all to
do. Everybody in this room has an
amazing calling on your life. And I want
to have the kind of faith that lets me
finish. Trials really do refine our
faith the way that gold is refined and
fire. The Apostle Paul wrote half of the
New Testament almost and he said this,
"We walk by faith, not by sight."
Meaning we keep walking even when the
path is hard and the path is difficult.
Three points in three minutes. Faith
endures when it wants to quit. Faith
believes when it can't see and faith
obeys when it doesn't understand. And I
pray today that your faith in Christ
remains strong. Would you stand today
and allow me to pray over you.
Lord, thank you for this day and your
goodness and your kindness. I'm grateful
for the men and women in this room who
serve our state so well. Would you give
them today the uh wisdom and discernment
and clarity as they make decisions. Uh
thank you for allowing us to live in
this wonderful state. I think it's the
best in the whole USA. I really do. I
love Georgia. Thank you for your
blessings. We love you today in Christ's
name. And we say together, amen. Would
you join me for the pledge today? I
pledge allegiance to the flag
of
the stands
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all.
>> Thank you for your time.

songwriter from New York. Although
Melvin Kent never reached his full
potential in his lifetime and faced
profound hardship, including
homelessness and moments of lost hope,
his story did not end there. One day he
discovered that a song he had written in
the 60s or 70s had been recorded by
Alicia Keys, a globally respected artist
known for her authenticity, artistry,
and cultural impact. You don't know my
name, has reached audiences far beyond
states and international lines. In that
moment, Melvin Kent was given a second
chance and a second win. He returned to
his songwriting dream with renewed
purpose. Tragically, he passed away just
six months later later, never fully
knowing how widely his work would be
celebrated. Today, his song continues to
live on, including being featured in the
stage production of Hell's Kitchen.
Melvin Kent never knew how famous his
work would become, but his legacy will
forever be enjoyed. I'm proud to say
Melvin Kent is and always will be my
uncle. Thank you, Uncle Melvin. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.
Thank you for that moment.
Appreciate your lady.
Chairman Corbett

>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the
House, it is my honor today to recognize
a group of unsung heroes that are here
with us today in the gallery. We have
four forest rangers from Charlton
County. Our forest rangers risk their
lives every day to protect people and
property. But on April the 10th of last
year, Chief Ranger Roger Todd and
members from his unit, Kenny Lee, Casey
Harris, and Bill Murray, they heard a
single engine aircraft overturned upon
landing at the Davis airport. The plane
immediately became engulfed in flames.
Chief Todd and members of his unit
responded without hesitation,
placing themselves in harm's way to
protect the lives of others. The plane
had six passengers on board, including
two young children. Under Chief Cha
Todd's directions, the responding
personnel worked swiftly, decisively,
and courageously to suppress the fire
and rescue the trapped passengers.
Actions that prevented loss of life and
ensured all six occupants survived the
crash, including the two young kids. In
recognition of his exemplary service,
leadership excellence, and life-saving
action, Chief Ranger Todd was selected
as a 2025 director's Award recipient.
One of the highest honors bestowed by
the Georgia Forest Commission. I'm going
to ask Roger, Chief Ranger Todd and his
his unit to stand and be recognized by
this house. Let's give them a
congratulations, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for
being with us today. And thank you for
your service every day, but especially

lives. We most appreciate y'all's
service. Thank you.

Represent Sheay Roberts is recognized
for a morning order. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Today, we are welcoming our
favorite folks in the red shirts to the
gallery, Moms Demand Action. We've got a
couple up there. They're spread out all
throughout the Capitol.
They are advocates who carry the weight
of every parent's fear and turn it into
fearless action. We cannot honor them
without confronting the truth. In
Georgia, approximately 2,000 people are
killed by guns each year and thousand
more are wounded, placing our state
among the highest in the nation for
firearm deaths. And we know it firsthand
right here in Georgia. Amy St. Pierre
died a few years ago in a Midtown
doctor's office. And just over a year
ago, a 14-year-old armed with
semi-automatic rifle killed two students
and two teachers at Appalache High
School. A horror that reminds us all how
fragile school safety can be. When we
talk about school safety, metal
detectors and panic buttons are fine,
but they are a band-aid. They react
after the gun has arrived and the harm
has begun. What we need are laws that
make guns less accessible to people who
shouldn't have them. Safe storage,
comprehensive background checks, and
sensible limits. Please talk to these
folks who are all around the capital
today. Do not run from them. 60 to 80%
of Georgians want common sense solutions
including in your districts and so
please give them your time. Thank you
Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.

driven on county and city roads. Um the
vehicles have to be older than 25 years
old. This is very similar to what we did
with side by sides um few years back. Um
we're just adding we're creating a
definition for mini truck and adding
that word um into the section. Mr.
Speaker, with that I will yield for
questions.
Gentleman has a couple of questions.
Uh, Park Whip Whip Park, I'll get that
right. Has a question. You can either
one either way you want to go with that.
There we go. The gentleman's recognized
for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes. Uh, so I had two questions. Um,
first on line 19, the definition of a
miniature on-road vehicle states that
these are imported vehicles. Are any of
these miniature trucks domestically
manufactured?
>> So domestic manufacturers would have to
read the meet the federal guidelines um
and therefore they would not apply to
this bill. They would already be allowed
to be driven.
>> So So this would just permit foreign
imported vehicles on our county and
local roads.
>> That's correct. Do you know how many
manufacturers this would potentially
benefit? Foreign manufacturers potent
potentially benefit?
>> I do not. I know there's a lot of these
vehicles already over here because
people are bringing them over and using
them for personal use. So, we're just
allowing individuals to be able to use
them on county and city roads.
>> Does a gentleman you have for one more
question?
>> Yes. Uh with respect to um the local
control aspect, um you know, I know the
bill allows for cities and counties to
opt out, but does it require any sort of
affirmative action from local
governments in order to opt out? Does it
require any additional funds or
expenditures uh for a city or county to
say we don't want these on our on our
streets? Um, so as far as local control,
if cities do not want these on their
city and county roads, then they can um
enforce that and um get that message out
there however they deem fit.
>> Thank you.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Representative Chaz Cannon to your right
is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes, I do. If I were to have one of
these uh mini trucks on private
property, could I use it to shoot feral
hogs with?
>> Uh if we can get this bill passed and
the governor will sign it. Absolutely.
Yes, sir. We can.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
>> Leader Estrations recognized for a
question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes, sir. Representative U, what are the
differences in this legislation compared
to the mini truck legislation that this
House has passed overwhelmingly
what seems like several years in a row.
>> The only difference between this bill
and last year's bill is the date. We
changed uh 2025 of last year to 2026
this year for when it will go into
effect. There's nothing else that has
been changed.
>> No other change from when this house has
previously passed this same language. It
sounds like repeatedly over the past few
years as I recall.
>> That's correct.
>> And do you yield for one other question?
>> Yes, sir.
>> You uh referenced that this follows the
um side byside structure and that it's
local roads speed restriction. Um is
that framework consistent with how local
governments would deal with types of
vehicles like these as prepare as
proposed in this legislation? In other
words, with respect to how we've treated
similar vehicles, does your bill follow
that framework?
>> Yes, sir. Absolutely.
>> Thank you.
>> Representative Jasmine Clark to your
left is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes. Um, can you explain just I'm very
curious about why they need to have been
manufactured for 25 years. So, these are
quite old by the time they're allowed to
be on our roads. Is that correct?
>> Yes, it is. Federal guidelines requires
any um automobile um within earlier or
outside of this time frame to meet
federal guidelines and therefore that is
not something we are trying to overrule
at this point. Uh, so this brings par
with federal guidelines,
>> I believe. So,
>> all right. Thank you.
>> Representative Gamble up the center
aisle is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does
the gentleman yield?
>> Yes, sir. Uh, is it not true that you
and I have had extensive conversations
about this legislation and and why we
need this clarity and that I have a lot
of constituents who have talked to me
about how important this is and I'm
looking forward to uh voting in support
of this legislation.
>> Yes, sir. I appreciate it. And I will
add, you would be very surprised to see
the amount of emails I have gotten on
this bill with support asking um me to
run it get it all the way through. Um
there's a lot of support behind these
vehicles that people are very unaware
of. Thank you.
>> Sounds like you got two votes. Anyway,
let's see. Uh Chairman Gullet is
recognized for the final question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen,
yield.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Doesn't this just really set clear
minimum requirements for these vehicles
to be used on roads safely?
>> Absolutely.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Thank you, speaker. I will yield the
well and ask for your f favorable
consideration.
>> The gentleman has yielded the well.
We have no further discussion on the
bill. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? Hearing
none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the to the passage of the
bill? Hearing none, the report of the
committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the passage of
the bill, we'll vote yes. All those
opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,
will you unlock the machine?
For what purpose does Chairman Thomas
rise?
>> Parliamentary inquiry.
>> State your inquiry. Is it not true that
I was the only member of this body to
vote against this bill last year, but I
am voting for it this year.
>> Well, I think a lot of a lot of other
people changed their mind, too, I guess.
Well, you've seen the light. I can tell.
So, I'm glad you're educated. That's
what we do here. When we disagree with
each other, we um we educate those
members.
For what purposes, Representative Whip
Berett rise?
>> Parliamentary inquiry. State your
inquiry. Is it not true that the bill
allows for local control by allowing for
the city or county to prohibit by
ordinance or resolution these many
trucks? Is that not true, Mr. Speaker?
>> Sounds like you've read the bill.
No further questions. Have all members
voted?
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine on the passage
of House Bill 957? The yays are 162, the
nays are five. This bill, having
received the requisite constitutional
majority, is therefore passed.
Boy, y'all, I have a great honor. I got
the boyans up here with me.
We're going to take a photo soon as we
call this next bill.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to
House Bill 676?
House Bill 676 by Representative Clifton
of the 131st and others to be entitled
an act to amend part three of article 8
of chapter 14 in title 44 of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to mechanics and materialmen
relative to leans so as to provide for a
fine for any frivolous mechanic lean
filed. This bill referred to the
committee on judiciary. That committee
recommends that this bill do pass.
Representative Rob Clifton is recognized
to present another bill. There's a
reason you kind of doing these things
today, isn't it?
>> Yes, sir. And if I could take a moment,
I want to thank you and leadership for
allowing me to run these bills today. My
wife uh started contractions yesterday.
So, um this baby is coming sooner than
later. So, I'm going to try to get all
this done. And uh I appreciate you and
your leadership, sir.
>> You have 30 seconds to be done with your
bill. You need to get home.
The gentleman's recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um today I have
House Bill 676. Um this is a frivolous
lean bill. So the law and the code is
very specific on what you need to do or
in order to have lean rights. Uh
unfortunately in today's day and age, uh
filing a lean on a property has been
become a tactic for um entities that may
not have rights to bully their way into
getting what they want. All we are doing
here is adding a penalty so that if
someone does uh file a frivolous lean,
uh the penalty would be $1,500. in
addition to attorney's fees and court
fees. With that, Mr. Speaker, I will
yield for questions.
>> You did pretty good. That's how you do
with the questions. Rep. Representative
Fenoi to your left is recognized for a
question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes.
So, as a former commercial and
residential title examiner, um will this
bill not only be beneficial to clearing
title, but also uh prevent from
hindering those who are trying to
purchase homes from getting homes?
>> Absolutely.
>> Thank you for the bill. Gentleman has no
further questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Oh my goodness.
I've got baby brain. I blame it on my
wife. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask
for your favorable consideration.
>> We know where you need to be. go take
care of mama and all those other
children and a new baby, boy or girl.
>> All right. Congratulations to you. We
wish you all the best. Let's say a
prayer for he and his family and that
new child if you will.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered. Is
there any objection to agreeing to the

vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the
machine?
What's next?
Have all members voted?
All members voted.
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine? On the
passage of House Bill 676, the yays are
165, then days are zero. This bill
hadn't received a requisite requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to
House Bill 657 657?
House Bill 657 by Representative Hagen
and the 156 and others will be entitled
an act to amend title 37 of the official
code of Georgia annotated relating to
mental health so as to revive for the
qualifications of recovery community
organizations for substance use. This
bill referred to the committee on public
and community health. That committee
recommends that this bill do pass.
Charity Hagen from Lions, Georgia is
recognized to present the bill. Not to
be confused with Vaia. It's his own set
of folks down there in Lions. You're
recognized.
>> Absolutely correct, Mr. Speaker. And
thank you very much. And I don't know if
y'all noticed how high this mic was. Rob
Clifton was up here. He is very tall. Um
um members, colleagues, and friends, we
know that substance addiction is an
epidemic in Georgia and in the whole
United States, but also in Georgia, we
know that there is hope for many because
the recovery community in Georgia is so
strong.
Um, House Bill 657
provides consistency of care and quality
of support for a person or family in
substance abuse recovery by defining
certified peer specialists and laying
out requirements for recovery community
organizations. And I don't know if y'all
knew this, but Georgia has the second
largest number of RCOs in the nation.
Um, only behind Texas. And the beauty of
our recovery community organizations is
their uniqueness. In some states, they
have such strict guidelines on the RCOS
that they all are the same. But in
Georgia, ours are unique. And that is
important because a person who is
especially newly in recovery and seeking
help, they need to go somewhere where
they feel comfortable. So our RCOs are
known to be very specific to their
community so that they can be as
supportive and welcoming to people who
need their help as possible. So um all
of the RCOs in Georgia are supportive of
this legislation. Um, it is not a
department bill, but I have spoken with
Commissioner Tanner of DBHDD and he's
also supportive of this language. It
provides quality and consistency, but it
also allows for our RCOs to maintain
their individuality. So, Mr. Speaker,
that is the bill.
>> Lady has no questions. Good job.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I ask
for your favorable consideration. I
yield the well. We do have a member who
signed up to speak in favor of the bill.
Representative Park Cannon is recognized
to speak to the bill. Give the lady your
attention as she enters. Well,
Representative Cannon is recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hi, members. I'm
here excited about this bill. I think
there's been a lot of thought and
discussion with the community about this
bill, which is really great. And
particularly I'm interested because this
could provide improved support for
pregnant and postpartum people with
substance use disorders. This can help
create more clear standards for RCOs and
certified peer specialists who really do
the behind the scenes work of helping
ensure that pregnant and postpartum
families receive consistent support at
various times of the day and night,
individualized support, and most
importantly, evidence-based support that
is culturally sensitive. You know, often
families go through different treatments
after having a baby and
are sometimes considered more eligible
to relapse. After they've had a baby,
their risk of relapsing and overdosing
is actually higher than even when they
were pregnant. And so anything our state
can do for better coordination and
continuity of care is a great thing to
do for our maternal and infant health
outcomes. Secondly, I'm excited about us
recognizing that medicationass assisted
treatment and harm reduction approaches
work when you put them together. when
you explicitly recognize that there are
multiple pathways to recovery which can
be medication but a lot of times is harm
reduction and this bill really looks at
some of the best practices around harm
reduction. Many medical organizations
consider Medicaid medicationass assisted
treatment as the standard of care. Um,
and that's typically the standard of
care for pregnant patients with opioid
use with a disorder in this way because
it reduces their risk of overdose.
However, it's only best practice when
it's accompanied with harm reduction,
which means that maybe somebody is using
again and maybe they won't get in
trouble for using again. And so, not
just having this almost abstinence
onlyminded perspective, but truly a harm
reduction mindset helps encourage people
get the care that they need in the
postpartum period. I'm excited about the
greater consistency and quality control
that peer support service organizations
have been working on. I think requiring
a certification through DPH is a good
idea. It does create training and
professional standards that maternal
health advocates have seen be really
important to have. just simply
standardizing training, standardizing
some of the social needs in the way that
we talk about them, help people with
paranatal depression, help people with
birth trauma that they've experienced,
and decrease their use for risk for
substance use. Lastly, I just want to
thank everybody who worked on this
because it's better when we have a
stronger statewide coordination of our
recur recovery resources. And hopefully
we will have funding at some point and
that funding could help create more
programs and reduce some of the service
gaps that even LGBTQ Georgians have
spoken to seeing. And for folks in rural
districts, this is important for your
districts, most importantly, who have
low levels of obstetric providers or are
considered what March of Dimes would say
to be in a maternal uh care desert and
would allow for some of those
underserved families to get the maternal
recovery resources they need. I
encourage everybody to go to support.org
or and to sign up so that you start to
get some more information about this.
And thank you. I yield the well.
>> Ladies yielded the well. She had a
question, but that question was also
it's not going to be asked. So, we'll
move forward. That completes the uh disc
the presentation and discussion on House
Bill 657.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered. Is any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Hearing none, the
report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote
yes. All those opposed, no. And Mr.
Clerk will unlock the machine.
For what purpose? Cheer lady camp rise.
>> Parliamentary inquiry.
>> State inquiry.
>> Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that when
individuals in recovery have the opport
opportunity and option to work with peer
counselors, their rate of recovery is
higher because they're dealing with
individuals who are actually have
they've been where they've been. And I
appreciate this bill for my community
because we have a wonderful peer-to-peer
recovery community organization and
they're have success stories every day.
Thank you.
>> Thank you for making us aware of that.
For what purposes representative Barnes
rise?
>> Parliamentary inquiry.
>> State inquiry.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true
that this bill will also uh bring
services to our youth who are in
recovery as well?
>> Thank you for making that point. I think
I agree with you as well. That completes
uh our discussion is and I think we've
all voted. So, have all members so
voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock
the machine? On the passage of House
Bill 657,
the yays are 167 and nays are two. This
bill, having received a requisite
constitutional majority, is therefore
passed. Congratulations,
Mr. Clerk. Will you read the caption of
House Bill 632
632?
House Bill 632 by Representative Bonner,
the 73rd and others being tal of act to
amend chapter 12 of title 43. The
official go to Georgia annotator
relating disabled veterans and blind
persons engaging in pedalling, operating
businesses or practicing professions so
as to clarify certain veterans
eligibility for exemptions. This bill
referred to the committee on regulated
industries. That committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
>> I like clarifying.
Chairman Barner is recognized to present
House Bill 632.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 632
simply clarifies an existing benefit for
our disabled veterans uh that makes them
exempt from the payment of occupational
taxes. This bill updates eligible dates
of service consistent with federal code
and establishes a formal process through
the Georgia Department of Veterans
Services for this. Again, this simply
clarifies an existing benefit due our
disabled veterans in Georgia. With that,
Mr. Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to take
any questions.
>> Uh to your left up front, Whip Park is
recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh to the
gentleman, thank you for the bill. Do
you yield?
>> I do.
>> On line 55, it increases the physical
disability rating from 25 to 30. Is
there anybody currently receiving the
exemption that would lose it by this
change?
>> No. Uh because the uh the VA awards
these uh credits in multiples of 10. So
if someone has a 25% disability, it's
basically rounded up to 30.
>> Thank you.
>> Representative Carmen Rice to your left.
>> Thank you.
>> To your left. Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> I do.
>> Is it not true that House Bill 632 helps
disabled veterans build stable lives,
making it easier for them to work and
start small businesses?
>> Absolutely. Well said. Thank you.
Gentleman has no further questions.
>> All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
yield the well and has asked for your
favorable consideration.
>> Gentleman has yielded the well. Is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered? Hearing none, the
previous question is ordered. Is there
any objection to agreeing to the report

favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the

opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will
unlock the machine.
Have all members voted?
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine on the passage
of House Bill 632?
The yays are 169, the naysay are zero.
This bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to
Senate Bill 162 162? Senate Bill 162 by
Senators Huffstetler to the 52nd and
others to be entitled act to amend
article one of chapter 34 title 43 of
the official go to George annotated
relating to Georgia composite medical
board so as to provide for the board to
implement an automated credentiing
system for healthc care providers in
this state. This bill I referred to the
committee on public and community health
that committee recommends this bill do
pass by committee substitute. Chair Lady
Cooper is recognized to present Senate
Senate Bill 162. The lady's recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, ladies and
gentlemen of the House, uh, I think
there's not one single person in this
chamber that doesn't real does not
realize how
>> will suspend for a moment.
>> Please continue.
>> Thank you. I think everybody in this
chamber realizes how short of doctors we
are. And one of the problems we have is
when we find a young doctor that wants
to come or a doctor from another state,
they have to find get a license in this
state. Then they have to get
credentialed at a hospital or wherever
they're going to work. And then if they
want to uh have Medicaid, they have to
be credentialed by the federal
government. All of this takes time. So
what this bill does as of January the
1st, 2027,
it instructs the board to update its
data management system and we would have
a one process not for the federal part
for Medicaid but at least for getting a
doctor his license and credentiing for
other hospitals. It would allow the
board to collect all that data as it is
licensing the physician and it would
also know what the hospitals wanted for
credentiing.
And if they had a special thing that
they wanted at a special hospital, then
they could add that too. And the board
would look at that and be able to give
the doctor his license quicker and his
credentiing quicker. And that would be a
major concern uh thing, major positive
things for Georgia going forth and
getting more physicians and getting them
to where they can practice more quickly.
There any questions? I'll be glad to
yield. Well, if not, I'll ask for your
favorable vote.
>> Leader Hugely to your left, right in
front has a question. Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentle
lady yield?
>> I will. Um, can you tell us the
estimated time of going to this new
system? How fast doctors would be able
to get their license? I mean, how much
time are we saving? I appreciate the
bill because it is taking too long right
now.
>> Thank you. That is on an individual
basis because we have to rely on the
physicians to get their when they first
come to get their school cred
credentials and where they graduated
from medical school and where they did
their residency. And a lot of it has to
do with how fast that comes in. But
usually that's not the hold up. The
other thing this does is once all that
information is in place, let's say the
information arrived on the 3 of February
and the board had met on one on the 1 of
February. This would allow the executive
director of the board to go ahead and
give temporary license and let them
start working until the board could meet
to confirm that if everything was in and
everything met the standard. So there's
no way to tell but it can take months
now for us to get a doctor credentialed.
>> Mr. Lady yield for another question.
Represent Cameron, Representative Mike
Cameron to your right.
>> Does the gentle lady yield? Will this
have any effect on after a doctor's
credentialed for a hospital like getting
credentiing for a health insurance
company? As I came out of that that area
and it takes sometimes a long time for
physicians to get credentialed.
>> It should help but that depends on the
health insurance company but it
definitely will on placing them in
hospitals and I hope that they would use
the same information because it will be
compiled in one place. Lady has one more
question. Representative Reese on your
left in the back.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does Lady Yel?
>> Yes, I will.
>> Isn't it true that this bill will help
us get doctors through the process
faster? Hopefully helping some of our
rural areas where we are in desperate
need of healthc care providers.
>> It certainly will. It's even helping and
I will tell you that uh our medical
school came up with helping us think
about doing this because they were
having to get people that have residency
credentialed at different hospitals and
that was causing a backup of our kids in
residency being able to go through their
rotations and they one of the doctors up
in Athens came up with this one of the
faculty and we are sort of mirroring
that. So thank you Mr. Speaker. I will
yield the well now and ask for your
favorable consideration of the Senate
Bill 162.
>> The lady has yielded the well. Is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered? Hearing none, the
previous question is ordered. Is there
any objection to adopting the committee
substitute? Hearing none, the committee
substitute is adopted. Is there any
objection agreeing to the report of the

those opposed will vote no. And Mr.
Clerk will unlock the machine.

Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?
On the passage of Senate Bill 162, the
yays are 167, the nays are zero. This

We're moving on. Afternoon orders. We're
going to recognize first for afternoon
orders.
You'll have a maximum
max of two minutes max. See if you can
beat it. Chair Lady Camp,
you're recognized. Represent Ali, you're
on deck. There will be chair matiac.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of
the house.
Bullying and de dehumanizing rhetoric
have no place in this chamber, our
state, or in this country. As elected
officials, we are tasked with the duty
of doing the people's business and
representing those who entrusted us with
their votes. Disagreement is expected,
but intimidation and dehumanization are
not. When individuals are mo labeled or
treated less than human, it does real
harm. It silences voices, erodess trust,
and weakens our institutions. Words
matter, especially rhetoric used by
those entrusted with public authority.
Civility is not weakness. It is
leadership, and it requires discipline,
restraint, respect, even in moments of
disagreement. The tone we set here
shapes the discourse in our communities
and the conduct we are willing to
tolerate. If we want a stronger Georgia,
a stronger democracy, we must reject
bullying in all of its forms and commit
ourselves to civil, respectful
discourse. Thank you.
>> Lady has
presented her after an order. Represent
Ali.
He'll
be in a few minutes, I guess. Okay, he's
coming up now. The gentleman's
recognized.
Chair Matiac, you're next.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of
this house. As is the timehonored
tradition that has been started by my
predecessor, I wanted to direct your
attention to the screen where we have uh
a child that is up for adoption. As you
all know, the foster care system is very
near and dear to my heart, as is many
people in this room. uh this this son of
Georgia is up for adoption. And one of
the things that we can make a difference
through more than just legislation is to
show folks family and to show folks
human connection and to show folks
community. And so once again, it always
is through D it's my turn
now.Hs.jah.gov.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
>> Thank you, Representative Chair Lady
Biac.
Chairman Powell and Representative
Representative Wilkerson, you're on
deck.
>> I bring a friend with me.
>> If you have one, you can bring him. She
has a friend. She's going to bring you
along. Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. this or the this
morning. Um, Representative Lehood and I
would like to remind you that tonight is
um a little reception for seniors and
everybody's in invited at the Painted
Park on Highland Avenue tonight at 5:00.
But I also wanted to remind you that
Wednesday our seniors from all over the
state will be here and I invite you to
visit with them on Wednesday as well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you very much,
Chairman Powell.
Representative Wilkerson.
Gentleman recognized.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of
the House. Today, Representative
Wilkerson bringing to you a piece of
bipartisan legislation. In the early
90s, the state uh the current that law
that we elected state school uh our
local school superintendents, but local
governments could have an appointed
superintendent. That changed in 94 and
went in effect of all appointed. What we
brought to you today is because of a lot
of constituents have talked to us about
the desires to elect a superintendent.
those people who are directly
responsible for spending so much of the
local monies to education and setting
education policy. So what we're
proposing in this today would be that a
constitutional amendment to allow by
local legislation and referendum for
those counties that want to have an
elected school superintendent that they
can do so.
>> Now this would be an option. It would
not be mandatory. you would keep your
current process in place and if you
decide to do it in the local community,
you could. So, it's giving an option to
the local communities that would love to
see them electing their superintendent
as it was years ago. So, if you're
interested, please see chairman pal and
uh or myself.
>> Appreciate it.
>> Thanks.
>> Strong team right there.
>> We have one more after order. Represent
Park Cannon.
Ladies recognized for afternoon order.
Give the lady your attention, please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today marks one
year since the tragic loss of Adriana
Smith. I spoke with her mother again
last evening and she wanted to share
with everyone that there will be 10
billboards digitally placed throughout
Atlanta, Georgia so that people don't
forget her. She says she thanks everyone
for their support. This has been a very
hard time for her and her family and she
just wants to say thank you for all the
prayers and the messages that she has
received. She hopes that no one else
gets hurt and hopes that there are
changes in Georgia laws for this. As you
may remember, Adriana Smith was
pregnant, a nurse, and unfortunately
suffered um an issue in her brain and
was not able to regain her
consciousness. And she remained pregnant
up until um 20some weeks. And um baby
Chance um was delivered. And baby Chance
is still fighting for his life. He's in
his second hospital now after many, many
surgeries. um and their family is still
very much grieving. But today we just
think about Adriana Smith and about her
mom, Miss April Newkerk. I love you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
