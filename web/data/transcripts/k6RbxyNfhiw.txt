Speaker Representative Glanton Ladies and gentlemen of the house This morning I consider the great honor to stand before you as a proud citizen of the great state of Georgia as a veteran of the US Army and the Gulf War And as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm certain that we all would agree That one of the greatest discoveries in life is the discovery of purpose Our raison d'etre our reason for being The late dr. Miles Monroe once said purpose is always hidden in the mind of the manufacturer And I believe that it is God's divine purpose that we're all here today I believe that our purpose for convening in this secret assembly was crystallized On July 28th 1787 During the constitutional convention when our forefathers were deadlock While trying to reach an agreement to create laws that would govern direct And united young united states of America It was Benjamin Franklin who appealed to the noble body To humbly apply to the father of lights to illuminate their understanding He reminded them that knowing the contest with great Britain When they were sensible of danger they had daily prayer for divine protection And their prayers were heard and were graciously answered And he asked the question Have we now forgotten that powerful friend Or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance He said the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth The god governs in the affairs of man And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable That an empire can rise without his aid Benjamin Franklin quoted the sacred writings that said except the Lord build the house They labor in vain that build it He then demanded that henceforth prayers employing the assistance of heaven And its blessings on our deliberations be held in their assembly every morning Before proceeding to business It is with that desire of Benjamin Franklin and those that have gone before us That I ask that you would please stand this morning and join me in prayer Lord, thank you for this opportunity to join together in corporate prayer We thank you for these great men and women that you've called And that the people have elected to be their voice Lord, please give them the guidance that they need to address the issues that are before them And we take comfort in the fact that they did not begin anything Without acknowledging you as their guide in the head of all they do Strengthen them to use the power authority and influence that they've been given to govern and guide your people Help them to embrace the responsibility and not shun from it Keep their bodies strong their minds sharp their family safe And their hearts open to hear from you Father, we ask that through the power of your Holy Spirit you constantly remind us all That although we're in authority you're always in control These things we ask in your matchless name amen Amen And that's the leads us to the fact of the United States of America I can do the republic for words to say One nation in our own God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all Doorkeepers will unlock the doors You You Chair recognizes chairman hogan the chair of the committee on information and audits Mr.

Well, good morning colleagues and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is multiple sclerosis day at the Georgia State Capitol. Multiple sclerosis also known as MS is a neurological disease of the central nervous system that is debilitating to all who suffer from it. But with advocacy and persistence, we are pursuing pushing forward to get individuals with MS access to treatment. Stopping MS in its tracks and restoring with this terrible disease has taken from so many Georgians is the mission of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. They have invested more than $1 billion in research and funded projects focused on the benefits of exercise and cognitive rehabilitation that lead to breakthroughs and treatment. Last year, the National MS Society urged this body to increase access to low THC medical cannabis oil so that people living with MS in Georgia would have more treatment options for symptom management when recommended by the health care provider. Ladies and gentlemen, please recognize MS Society today. Thank you for your support, Mr. Speaker. APPLAUSE Chair recognizes Representative Kelly, the majority caucus whip for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I come here today to recognize the birthday of a great Georgian, Hammer and Hank Aaron. As we all know, Hammer and Hank was a long time brave player in Atlanta from 1966 to 1974. But before that, he was with the Milwaukee Braves where he won a World Series in 1957. Hank Aaron, we know, continues to hold the record for most career runs, batting in, most career bases, and most extra base hits. And while there's others that may have more home runs than the record book, we know that he'll always be our home run king. And we'll always remember that famous trip he took around the bases after he hit the home run over to left field wall of full-ton count and stadium. We all helped me join and well, helped me join and wishing, Hank Aaron, a happy birthday today. APPLAUSE Chair recognizes Representative Marin for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A good morning, one of the us. What a missed opportunity from last night's speech to highlight the many contributions that our immigrant community gives every day to this country. Where lawyers, where engineers, where doctors, where blue collars, where white collars, we serve in the armed forces. Where are your neighbors? Where are your colleagues? Where elected officials? And still, what I heard last night was that immigrants, are thieves, murderers, drug traffickers, human traffickers, the worst. Georgia, we're better than dead. Thank you. APPLAUSE And I promise never to treat a governor's speech the way that speech was treated at the end last night. APPLAUSE Regardless of party, chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. If you attended the Facebook training yesterday or did not end, and you would like the contact information to help with your Facebook training, you can see me at my desk, and I can forge you all the email information, and it has some good tips for you. But thank you for everybody that attended. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Lopez Romero for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also want to follow up in the conversation about last night's speech. And I expect the same rounding applause after I finish speaking. I was also undocumented for 12 years of my life until I was 17 years old. Needless to say, I am not a rapist. I am not a murderer, and I am not a trafficker. But I do love our state, which is one of the reasons I so hold so highly, being an elected official, and being your colleague, and sitting with you, and having these conversations. Even when we disagree, we can come back the next day and talk, as we've talked, about what we're doing in our personal lives, or complain about the coffee. Because ultimately, we are all Georgians. And even though I was disappointed by last night's speech, I have encouraged by many individuals that have now come to call colleagues that we have had conversations. Because I know that this chamber, I'm not sure about what the other chamber may do. But I know that this chamber can do and will do better. I have seen half the chamber come and stand when we've done proclamations and resolutions for immigrant and refugee day. And I expect each and every one of those individuals that stood here and has signed on to those resolutions, to also sign on to positive legislation that benefits all Georgians, including our immigrant communities, including our communities that are undocumented, because they too are Georgians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman. Chair recognizes Chairman Randy Nicks for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to recognize today is the Georgia Automatic Merchandising Council Day at the Capitol. Now, you probably know these people as vendors. They're the people that way before Grubhub and Uber Eats came along. They were out there providing meals for our hardworking men and women in Georgia in the workplace. They get the snacks to them, the lunches to them. And also now they have got a program called FitPick where they actually get the more nutritional foods to them. So help me recognize the Georgia Automatic Merchandising Council folks, feel please stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good job. Chair recognizes Representative Holly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today realizing that as a state, so many of our local folks who are back home expecting for us to do our work here, are relying on us to be able to marry the priorities which hold true to their own families, to the needs of this state, and to ensure that our focus does not shift to Washington, but we allow for Georgians here to make good decisions about Georgia's families throughout the state. Hopefully, I'm hoping that by the firm support of local control, of home rule, of communities coming together, that we don't allow for divisiveness at the national spectrum to be able to infect what we do here locally. We have teachers, we have preachers, we've got police officers, we've got business folks, back home, Republican and Democrat. And we know that as much as we're able to pass 90% of the legislation out of this house by partisan, that we can look to each other and ensure that we can find a not only just a common cause or a ceremonial gesture, but let's make people's priorities real by ensuring that every measure of success that comes out of this house is not attributed to one political party or another, but let it be by the sheer grace of God himself. You'll the well, thank you, sir. Thank you. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the house for a morning order. Gentlemen, it'll be reminded you have 45 seconds and we will then end morning orders. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Tomorrow, February the 6th, will be an important day in history of our country. It is the birthday of one of our greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States, president Reagan won the Cold War. Said our economy on a pace that has been unmatched. He strengthened our military, made us proud again. He strengthened capitalism in this country and he defeated communism in this country and around the world. Had solve great much gratitude. Thank God for the life and service of president, Ronald Reagan. Thank you. Thank you. Under the rules of the house, the time for morning orders has expired today and so those we didn't get to and they were multiple, we'll have to come back to you next time we're here. Chair recognizes Chairman Newton for to introduce the Doctor of the Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I'm excited that today we're celebrating public health day here at the Capitol and I'm honored to have our Commissioner of the Department of Public Health with me, Dr. Kathleen Toomey, but it's not heard by herself. It doesn't take a coronavirus or a SARS-Ops break before you learn to appreciate public health. It takes a team. So I'm going to serve in insist today as Doctor of the Day. We have public health district directors who traveled from all over our state as large as it is. The largest east of the Mississippi River. So in addition to Dr. Toomey here with me, the men and women on the front line of the public health are Dr. Vosio Taylor Logan. If I can ask you all to stand if you're in there. Arona Ford, Obasanjo, Kraft, Haynes, Dr. Joggins, Townsend, Grow, Ruiz, Davis, and Dr. Parks. Thank you for your service to the state and I'd love to let us hear from if we can say thank you for you to be in hearing. Thank you. Doctor Toomey, thank you for being here. I promise I would speak very quickly about public health, which is hard for me, but it's a real thrill to be here today on this historic day, the first public health day ever at the Capitol. As Commissioner of Public Health and a former Health Director myself, no one is more appreciative of the work that goes on at the district and county levels that I am. And I'm proud to be here today with the health directors. For they are truly the doctors of the day, every day in our communities. Whether it's working to improve the health of mothers and babies across Georgia or ensuring that the state is responding to a potential threat of coronavirus as we did as we've been doing the last several days, public health works best when we work together as a team. And what you see here by having us together and working together reflects that approach to a public health system. On this historic day, we all look forward to the opportunity to meet with you individually. And I think we collectively want to thank you all for the support you've given public health over the many years. And I personally want to thank you, as well as the health directors, for your leadership and support for this great state of ours. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to recognize them or not, but they're going to become asking you to come to the dedications and the construction that's going to go on Saturdays. Here with me, I've got Natasha Reed Rice, who's the Associate General Counsel of Habitat International. And y'all know we're the 15th largest builder in the United States, the 15th largest. That's when the economy's going good. We like to stay around 15. Got Charles Smith from Athens, murdered a Patterson who's a Habitat homeowner and a 9-11 survivor. Ryan Willoughby. Oh, he's not here. And Brent Boehand and from Goonette. But look, I appreciate y'all listening to what's going on and supporting Habitat. And we've got a couple words from Natasha. Good morning. Thank you, Speaker Rawson. Thank you, Rep. Fryer. It's great to be here with Habitat Georgia, representing and supporting 55 Habitat affiliates throughout our great state. Habitat, as many of you know, has enjoyed a great relationship with Georgia. We started in America's Georgia over 40 years ago. We are now headquartered in America's And Atlanta. And one of our most favorite volunteers is a well-known Georgia and former president, Jimmy Carter. In Georgia, we know that home ownership and stable housing leads to improved outcomes in education, in health, in well-being, and overall success. A recent study done in partnership with Georgia Tech and Kinesa State engaged the impact that home ownership has on the lives of Habitat homeowners in Georgia found that nearly 70% of homeowners come off of public assistance once they purchase their home. 70%. Here in Georgia, one in seven households spends more than half of their income on housing. Nationwide, more than 18 million people spend more than half of their income on housing. And we at Habitat say that that is unacceptable. Imagine spending more than half your income on housing. How much of your money is then left for all of the other costs that are necessary to thrive and to live in our great country? Through Habitat's cost of home campaign, we are engaging housing advocates, volunteer supporters, and legislators around the country. Habitat for Humanity is grateful for the general assembly's attention to housing affordability and for legislation providing for tax exemptions on property owned by nonprofit organizations such as ours. Thank you for your support, for your attention, and we look forward to... We are now going on to the rules calendar. We're going on to the rules calendar. Let's have some order now. Members that are in the chamber, please take your seats. Please take your seats. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 935. House Resolution 935, members of the Tanner of the 9th and others, a resolution creating the Georgia Commission on freight and logistics. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Transportation that Committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, chairman Tanner, to present the resolution. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Most of the members here should recall last session we created the Freight Logistics Commission that's made up of members of this body experts from the private sector and members of the Senate. The members were appointed by the Speaker and the Lieutenant Governor. We've met over the course of several months over the summer and fall, taking on an issue that we've recognized the amount of freight coming into this state is going to double between now and 2040. The amount of freight coming into the port at Savannah continues to increase at a very rapid rate, which is going to tax the ability for our road infrastructure to be able to keep up. So we over the course of the meetings, traveling the state, we've identified several key problems and concerns that the Committee recognized. And now the next part of our work would be to identify solutions to those issues. So this resolution before you today does nothing but simply extend the Freight Logistics Commission's work for another year for the purpose of identifying solutions to the problems we've identified. The Freight Logistics report has been made part of our joint transportation committee records and is available online for you to view. That's all this resolution does. It's just extend the commission for one more year. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions. You have no questions? The Speaker, I yield the well and ask for favorable consideration for House Resolution 935. Gentlemen, has yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Resolution 935. The eyes are 169. The nays are zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 326.

This resolution have been referred to the committee on state properties that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Hauston to present the resolution. Thank you Mr. Speaker. On behalf of Clay Perrick or Representative Sam White's and I myself I bring you House Resolution 326. This resolution honors a man who has dedicated his life to making life better for others and also for building and construction of roads, buildings and helping the infrastructure all over South Georgia. Roder-Dill began his career in the Department of Transportation and after that he went to work making life better as I said before and working on the infrastructure and the roads of all over South Georgia. He also was instrumental in building I-75. Mr. Yolk, I don't know if Yolk can even remember before we didn't have I-75 but Mr. Dill was there and he is still working right now with building a new patty cake house with patty cake house for abuse-wimming and he is instrumental in getting that done and his help build the track the tiffed area high school stadium it goes on and on and on the things that Roger Dill has done for our county and for our South Georgia people and I hope you were joined me in passing this resolution naming the new Department of Transportation building after Roger Dill. Thank you and I would appreciate your vote on this resolution if there are no questions I yield the well. You have no questions. Thank you.

Pickard's telling you yes sir chairman of the administration just out of curiosity isn't it true that overwhelmingly the people of the state of Georgia voted for this constitutional amendment overwhelmingly Georgian supported the creation of this court yes sir and just taking that out this is a supposition on my part but don't you think that the people if they voted to fund this position also expect this judgment to have retirement benefits and have trusted us with the with the aspect of the committee coming together and taking care of that matter well I take the gentleman's point maybe take it a step further this was contemplated discussed and debated in the enabling legislation that this body considered last year and passed and it would be a failure to follow through with the objective and intent of the general assembly from the enabling legislation were we not to pass this bill so I agree with the gentleman's question okay and as a follow-up to that is it not true we make tremendous rise of the judicial system during the course of the last couple of administrations and this is just one more piece of the puzzle that fits in yes sir thank you for the question thank you you do not have any further questions well yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration thank you gentlemen as yielded the well is thereanny objection to the previous question being ordered the chair heirs none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute the chair heirs none the committee substitute is abundant is there any objection to agree to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair heirs none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 663 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 663. The eyes are 164. The nays are seven. House Bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House will come to order. We still got one piece of business to take care of. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Resolution 712. Senate Resolution 712 by Senate Adougan, 30th, and 40th. Kennedy, 18th, and Walker, 20th. Resolution relative to meetings in the Germans of the General Assembly and for other purposes. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House to explain the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Clerk, could you put the resolution for the members? Thank you, sir. This scheduling resolution takes us a little further down the road so we can plan our work and continue our deliberative process when it comes to the budget. The first I'd like to say thank you to Chairman Terry England and his help with negotiating this schedule. And certainly our speaker, Speaker Ralston, his great leadership helped us to come to this scheduling agreement. And certainly majority leader Mike Dugan over in the Senate. As always, we consider our scheduling resolutions in this House. First and foremost, it's certainly for us to be able to come here and continue our work and do our work in a manner that we're expected to do, but also the needs for our families and our work schedule back home because we all do have another life as we all know. And certainly we're very respectful of that and that's the speaker's instructions to make sure we do that was best for our members and for their families. But as we work this year to take care of our constitutional mandate that we must accomplish doing this session is past that balanced budget. We have to have time for that deliberative process. We need to be prudent to allow Chairman England and the members of the committee that many of you sit on, perform that work and have the information to perform that work and consider the proposals that impact the people of this state in the 2020 amended budget and in the 2021 big budget. So I will you see and I won't read it all out to you. I think y'all can understand what we see here that takes us out tomorrow and then we'll be back in for day 13 on March. Excuse me. February the 8th, February the 18th would be day 13 and you can see it takes us out the cross over day. I'm sure you have some questions about next week. Next week will be budget week. The appropriations committee will be meeting and on your desk the speaker has put out an instruction memo that explains how the week will go down as far as the appropriations committee meeting but allowing each member of this body to participate in those meetings if they so choose or to be present. So if you have any questions, if you've looked at the memo, it's been on your desk. If you have questions about the schedule, I'll be glad to try to ask them for you at this time, Ms. Speaker. You do not appear to have any questions. Well thank you, Ms. Speaker. Again for your leadership, members, I hope this works for all of you. It's the best we can do to make sure we can do our work in a prudent manner and I'll ask for your approval of Senate resolution 712 and I yield the will, Ms. Speaker. Before we vote, Mr. Leader, I want to thank you for your hard work. The majority of the leader has worked on this resolution for a couple of three weeks now, I guess. You know, everybody starts speculating back and on as early as October when you're all going to get out. That's the biggest question we get asked when you get now. Well this year I think the biggest question is where do we cut? We were sent here to do a job and we're going to do it and we're going to do it together. So because we're the decisions that are made on the budget touch the lives of every Georgia citizen, man, woman and child. And I don't believe that it behooves us as a body to come down here and speed through spending $28 billion of taxpayer money just to go home before somebody's lease runs out or go home to run in a reelection. I was going to allow other committees to meet next week but Chairman England tells me he's going to need all week for the appropriations committee and you have all week and tomorrow. You might want to take Valentine's Day off, just say it. But this will get us through to an amended budget and get us up to crossover and then we'll see where we go from there. So all those in favor of the adoption of Senate resolution 712 will vote I. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of Senate resolution 712. The eyes are 170. The nays are one. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted for what purpose does representative Skoggen's rise? To work in them? Trying to get you my turn down representative. I need to make a motion. State your motion. I move that House Bill 865 be moved from the committee on co-provision to the committee on judiciary. Love Chairman's do agree. Representative Skoggen's has moved that House Bill 865 be withdrawn from the code revision committee and committed to the judiciary committee. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 865, representative Skoggen's the 14th and others to be titled an act to men title 53, the fiscal to Georgia and Teter, relating to wills, trusts and administrations of the states. All the gentlemen's motion that House Bill 865 be moved from the code revision committee to the judiciary committee is their objection. Is their objection the chair here is none and it is so ordered.

But I did want to make one announcement prior to talking about the appropriations hearings. The 4-8 stay at the Capitol that was scheduled for tomorrow will be still here tomorrow. Most of their activities will be down at the depot. I think they will be up here for a little bit as well, but you will have constituents from all over the state.

So we can be ready to roll that then when we come back into session week after next. Appreciate the patients, appreciate the prayers. Many of you have come by and tapped me on the shoulder and just want to let you know that we appreciate that because there is nothing. There's certainly nothing easy in a year when we have money to make decisions of how to spread it around to help folks. But it's certainly much more difficult in a year when we're having to go in and look to make cuts. So thank you for that. And we look forward to seeing you all here today and tomorrow.
