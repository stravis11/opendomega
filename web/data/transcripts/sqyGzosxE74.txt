TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. I'm Harold Jones the Second Senate Democratic Leader out of Augusta
Georgia. My colleagues right now are fighting for democracy, fighting for our
democratic values as we fight against Senate resolution 563. Not only are we
fighting for our values as a democracy, we're also fighting to make
family our life more affordable. Working families have been and continue to
struggle under Republican leadership. Under this leadership for 22 years, not working
families have seen their ways of stagnate. They have seen the fact that child care costs
have gone up. They have seen their health care costs go up. We may be the number one state
to do business, but we are not the number one state to raise a family. Instead of addressing
these issues, in this general assembly this year, the Republicans have decided to borrow
phrase from George Herbert Walker Bush to basically practice voodoo economics. And what
is that voodoo economics that we talk about? And that is this idea coming from the Senate
about eliminating all income taxes. Understand that this is not an elimination of taxes,
this is actually a tax hike. It will be one of the largest tax hikes in Georgia's history
and it would be permanent. Why is it a tax hike? Because once you eliminate those funds
over half of our budget-cultural income tax,
it has to be made up from some place.
And historically, where you've seen it be made up at
is through sales tax.
And sales tax is something that impacts working families.
We can see sales tax rise up to almost 15%.
That is something that would devastate working families
of Georgia.
And the fact is, Republicans know this.
And instead of being honest with the people of Georgia,
they refuse to actually come clean
and say the effects this would have.
But that's just the start.
We still refuse to actually address
the healthcare crisis in this state.
Under Republicans in the DC,
because of Republican in action,
the ACA's tax credits have basically expired.
And here in the state,
the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus,
last year with SB192,
under Senator Jason Esteves,
tried to address this issue.
We're back again to address it once more.
This year with SB 379 was Senator Josh McLean.
We have drafted legislation to create our own premium tax credit.
We have done this because as you know,
many persons are not able to afford on the open marketplace
without these particular tax credits.
What people are seeing and what they have seen
is that their premiums will go up almost double.
That would decimate a working family.
And so therefore, we have created our own tax credit
for the state to actually adopt through SB 379,
the continuation of last year SB 192.
We are continuing to lead on this issue.
But as you are aware, there are many people
who also cannot afford on the open marketplace.
And to address that, we still are pushing
from Medicaid expansion.
That is being pushed by Senator David Lucas
in the form of SB 380.
You will remember that just a couple of years ago,
Senator Lucas was able to get a hearing.
The first of his kind, we was able to get a hearing
to expand Medicaid.
We are still looking to push that over
The finish line, uncomplicated care is killing health care in Georgia, but there is more.
We have to do more, not only as far as health care is concerned, but as far as also child
care is concerned.
As you know, child care in Georgia is one of the highest within the nation.
We have to make sure that our families can afford child care.
Therefore, we will continue to push for an expansion of our child care tax credit to
make sure that families can actually afford it.
So instead of actually talking about issues such as that,
the Republicans are saying we should get rid of all tax credits,
including that would be the childcare tax credit.
But we can go further.
When we talk about housing affordability, for instance,
once again, the Republicans are not leading the Democrats are.
We need to make sure we can make housing more affordable.
We're going to look into the fact that we have too many private
equity firms that are basically gobbling up houses within Georgia.
Georgia leads the nation as far as that is concerned.
private equity is buying up these homes and they're not treating them as homes, but as basically rental properties with
exorbitant rents. The second thing we can look at is trying to make sure we actually change our zoning laws. Whether we're talking about
lot sizes or laws as far as only being used for commercial development, we can do better there. We have to build homes.
We have to get people within homes. And for those that cannot afford to actually be in a home and they are
actually Renton, we can do something about that too.
Therefore, we continue to support Senator Don Geller-James,
as she has actually presented legislation over the last two
years to talk about basically having some type of rent
control if counties deem that to be in their best interest.
This is not a mandate from the state.
It only says if counties think that they have to get some
control over their rents, they will have the eligibility
to do that.
As you know in Georgia, counties are precluded from even
thinking about the issue by law.
So we will continue to make sure that those who can not afford their own home or rental
homes, they can actually stay within those properties too, and we can make that affordable.
We have basically been leading on these issues.
We have continued to lead on the issue of education.
One of the things that we have to do, we are going to be supporting Senator Freddie
Powell Sims, as she makes sure we continue to publicly fund education, public education.
And she has drafted legislation and will continue to draft this legislation, which will actually
curtail vouchers as we basically give away taxpayer money to private systems.
We have to make sure that we correctly fund public education.
As pursuant to that, when we talk about funding public education, as far as funding, as far
as the QBE formula is concerned, we're going to continue to support Senator Rashan Kemp.
As one of the things that he would be presenting is to make sure that we weigh poverty within
the QBE formula as he continues to fight for opportunity weights to make sure it could
correctly fund public education.
These are things that Democrats have led on and we will continue to lead on.
But it does not end there because the fact of the matter is as we talk about affordability,
one of the big issues that is out there today, of course, is data centers.
And that is why the Democrats actually have completely led on this issue through Senator
Nanorock with SB 408 where we actually decided to sunset the tax exemption not from 2032 but
actually 2027 and that is led by Democrats and when you see that particular legislation
you will see that she actually has Republican signers but why is that because we led on
the issue there are other bills that came after ours but we were the first we were the first
to stand up address this issue respond to our constituents and realize that this is a major
issue affecting Georgia. And so we are there for that also. Other issues that we
also will be tackling is continue to look at food insecurity. That is a major
issue that myself have worked on in others. We will continue to look at that
particular issue too to try to make sure that food insecurity goes away in
Georgia. But whenever you talk about affordability, whether we're talking about
housing costs, childcare costs, healthcare costs, or data centers, you can't have
affordability if you don't have the opportunity to actually vote or you don't
the opportunity to actually make sure that your voice is heard and that is why
Senator Atlanta parent will be drafted and has drafted legislation dealing
with mid-cycle redistricting. That is not constitutional and is not right when
we should not do it and so we're going to make sure that we kind of put a stop
to that if Republicans are thinking about actually engaging in that process
too. So what you find is a whole list of process within this party within
our priorities. There are priorities that affect Georgia's and as I said
said earlier, one of our priorities also has to be to make sure that we still have a democracy
to live in.
And that's why we have so many of our colleagues right now fighting to make sure that takes
place after what just happened last night in Fulton County.
So our priorities are make sure we fight for you, fight for the people of Georgia, make
sure it's affordable, make sure it's a great place to live.
We have been the number one state to do business for many years, but we've never been the number
one state for people to actually live and work and raise the family.
That is the goal of the Democratic Caucus, that is the goal of the Democratic Party, and
that is the goal of all Georgia's.
With that, I'll take any questions.
Thank you.
Right, once again, as we talked about, eliminating the income taxes, as I said, is basically
would be disastrous our working families.
And the fact of the matter is, that's not just coming
from leader Harold Jones.
We know that the House does come from Kip's on economists,
who basically said, I believe it's 2018,
that any kind of proposal like that
was based from somebody who is not serious.
It is an unserious proposal.
The only way to actually make up that money
is to go to a, basically, a sales tax.
That decimates our families.
That's the only way to do it.
The idea that you're gonna eliminate
every single tax exemption.
One of the talking points that Republicans
to use it about eliminating your tax exemptions
is that it only goes to corporations.
And so therefore, we should be in favor of that.
Two points to that.
First of all, that's not true.
Many of our tax exemptions, in fact,
the majority of them actually go to individuals.
Remember, we don't have taxes on groceries,
prescription drugs, for instance.
And then when we also talk about
some of these tax exemptions and corporations,
Georgia many years ago decided our economic interest
was gonna be through the use of exemptions
and through tax credits.
To now say you're gonna take away all of that,
that actually make people lose jobs
and we'll lose momentum as far as the economy is concerned.
So it's an idea that is not serious.
I concur with Governor Kim's economist said,
it's an unserious idea.
But it is an idea that's dangerous,
and it is one that would actually raise taxes
on working families,
because the only way you get in that money back
is through raising sales tax.
Second aspect of that, as you mentioned,
property tax too, basically the same answer to that.
There are other alternatives to those particular ideas
that we can explore.
One is what's called a circuit breaker property tax break
that you possibly could actually look at,
which puts ceilings on how much you actually pay
on your property taxes.
Those are things that you possibly can look at,
but to say that you're gonna get rid of the home set,
the exemption tax is, once again, not a serious idea.
Our counties would suffer.
Countess today don't want to raise taxes as it is.
They would also be forced to raise their local taxes,
and they then also would have to be forced
to be fined other avenues or make cuts
within their budgets.
What is it, what is it, what is that tax fund?
It funds your schools and it funds your police.
That's what it funds.
And that's exactly what you would be defunding quite frankly
if you actually went for either one of these proposals.
These are election year stunts,
but they're very dangerous stunts if they were to pass.
And so that's why we're here to fight against them.
Any others?
Thank you, that's for coming out.
Thank you so much, appreciate it.
Thank you.
Pizzley?
Yeah.
It's a big deal.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Okay, man.
Everybody show them.
Okay.
