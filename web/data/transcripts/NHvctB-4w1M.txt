Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 127th House District Representative Brian Prince. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. It is an honor to introduce and share my pastor. And Dr. Charles E. Goodman Jr. Dr. Goodman serves as a senior pastor and teacher of the historic Tabernacle Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia. But he doesn't serve alone. Please help me recognize the team that he's brought with him and that supports the church, the Charlene Patterson, Ms. Joyce Freeman, Ms. Zebra Jefferson, and Mr. Kendrick Lamar. Also one of our colleagues serves as one of his deacons, Representative Wayne Howard. Yes, it has been said that those that require a long introduction probably don't deserve them and those that deserve a long introduction don't require one. Therefore I'd like to thank the doorkeepers for placing Pastor Goodman's body on your desk so now I can get out of the way and let God use him. Here yee him. Good morning. Thank you again to our speaker and to all those who serve in this August body, to Representative Prince and Howard. Thank you again for your service and to all those who are representing us today in what is a wonderful day for us here at the Capitol Augusta Day. I hope that you enjoy your hats and we always represent 706 very well and it is a joy and a privilege to be able to stay in and share with you because you have important business to do. I also understand not only should the intro be brief but my message should be brief as well. Grateful for the staff that has traveled with us but I want to share today just simply something that hopefully will guide us. This body has come together whatever demographic and constituents that you represent. You have a lot of responsibility. As a text I want to lift up today found in Matthew chapter 12 verse 25 reading from the good news translation and this is what it says. Jesus knew what they were thinking so he said to them, many country that divides itself into groups which fight each other will not last very long. And any town or family that divides itself into groups which fight each other will fall apart. People want to think for us today I want to talk about this keep it together. As we are in a very interesting time not just nationally with a lot of things happening in politics but also even within our state. This great state that all of us love regardless of which banner you tend to lean to your side. But yet we understand that with trying times comes difficulties and difficulties often times can raise up disagreements. I want to submit for us today that just because there are disagreements disagreements does not mean there needs to be division. There is a way to disagree there is a way to work through things. And yet we begin to understand that somehow in our land that we love this place that has become a great place for us for great memories that somehow we have leaned instead of for disagreements into restoration we have leaned to disagreement and to division. Jesus and our text today was facing that. It was a lot going on in his time as he was sharing and trying to bring about the kingdom of God. Bible says know that the establishment was trying to put a fence if you will around his ministry and his message. And so they were trying to figure out what makes him so special. So others were pagan and said well he is doing this because he is working for the wrong team. He is doing this because he is working against himself in essence. Or maybe he is not as good as he should be. That is why this text is so powerful because it is a response that Jesus gives to them about the reality of the vision. He literally says to them I hear your thoughts but I want you to understand that we are really on the same team. Even the antagonist that Jesus had to flow against were people of the religious order. He wanted them to know in this simple little word he said in the country that divides or is not with itself will not last long and any town that is against itself will not stand. Those two thoughts are powerful. It simply says that division has these two destructive things that it has no long tenure and it has no foundation. For us who share in this burden of leading is oftentimes hard to try to navigate that fine line. What I simply want to challenge you with today is no matter how much we may disagree and we will disagree. My prayer is that we will move not from disagreement to division but disagreement to restoration because we are warned according to the words of Jesus that if we are spent in division we will not last long neither will we stand long. It is my prayer that our country, the state, this August body last long and stand strong and that only happens when we are unified even in the midst of disagreement. Let us pray. God we thank you again for the opportunity to serve and all of us here regardless of our political agenda and our political party affiliation. We come with one on a realizing that you are the one that leads us and guides us. So what we pray is that we continue to give strength and guidance to this body. We thank you for the leadership and we thank you for all who are here representing their different places in this wonderful state called Georgia. And just as we have been challenged today it is our prayer and the midst of our policies and the midst of us going back together. We would ask God help us that no matter what we do to keep it all together we want to last long and stand strong. So be with us. That is the only way we can do this. That is the lead us in your way and help us so that we can be a better state, a better country for the glory of God. This is our prayer. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the fact of the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands one nation under God in this as well with liberty and trust as a scroll. More keepers will unlock the doors. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. Chairman Hogan. Yes sir. Is that the official report you just gave us or one that you pulled out of your coat pocket?

Today he came here thinking we were recognizing former Representative Amy Carter, so as this is a surprise to him. Dr. Spurgeon William Clark as a third generation ophthalmologist from Wakecross, Georgia. Dr. Clark has a true servant spirit and has been serving his entire life. Admittedly, Dr. Clark's strong service spirit was inspired by his fathers advocating and leading in the community.

We appreciate as physicians the opportunity to work with you to better our patients, your constituents care. And I thank you so much for this recognition and you guys owe you one very soon. Clark, I rate the caption to House Resolution 899. House Resolution 899, I remember I've done it with 30th bar, and the 130th, Dublin, with 29th, Hawkins, the 27th, and Hatch, the 150th and others, a resolution congratulating commanding the Georgia Beekeepers Association on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. Chair recognizes Representative Dunahoo for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I come to you today thanking you again for two years ago. We passed a B tag and this B tag is already making a difference in our state. Georgia is number three in the country in selling and growing bees. We stay between eight and ten in selling honey. But this group next to me are the people that are really responsible in growing and educating Georgians. So I look at this as I introduce each person and I think this is 100 year anniversary. We have up here Miss Linda Tillman, President of GBA, Gina Galucci, Vice President, Gail Dean, Dan Lone. And we have a lady up here in Virginia, Webb. Her honey has won the world champion honey contest for five years. That's five times. That's pretty impressive honey. And if you need some, I think Al needs to give this to the speaker. But I would like to introduce this time Miss Linda Tillman and thank you, Ms. Speaker. I appreciate it. You talk about this good honey and you don't bring me any? I'll take it. I won't get you so much. Thank you everybody. We're very excited about the license plate and want to thank you first for passing it so that we can have it on the road. The license plate contributes to the education of beekeepers and to the education of the public about the bees. And we are very proud to support our bees because bees are crucial to the agricultural industry in Georgia. Bees pollinate soybeans, they pollinate cotton, they pollinate a lot of the fruits and vegetables that we eat. In addition, our beekeepers send bees to California to pollinate the almond, our beekeepers in Georgia send the bees to do that. They send bees to Michigan to pollinate blueberries there. And they send bees all over the country. In addition to that, we sell bees. The actual bee, the little buzzing insect to beekeepers all over the country and Georgia is one of the top states doing that as well. So we are thrilled to be celebrating our 100th anniversary and look forward to 100 more years. And thank you all for your support. Miss. Speaker. Now, we would like to give this resolution to the beekeepers. Thank you again and I always appreciate that opportunity. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. House resolution 1065, I'm your to the 150 second. Grinnell, 151st, Berkall, 155th McCall 33rd, and Corv. 174th, a resolution commanding Sam X White, the Southern Sky Center for diverse arts and culture in its village community garden of Sylvester, Georgia and for other purposes. Chair recognizes representative Yerda for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, it's my great pleasure to recognize an individual that has made a great difference in our community. He has come up with something that was outstanding. About 15 years ago, excuse me, about five years ago in 2015, Sam approached a city of Sylvester about a community garden and we could not have imagined what that would have become. Sam has really become a, he's actually an artist by trade. He's very talented individual. The community garden at this time has welcomed over 2000 local, national and international guests. It has actually become a model for other communities who replicate his garden. They provide food for the needy and provide fresh vegetables and produce for folks in our community that would not have access to that also. They have also implemented aeroponic growing towers, which are really, really cutting-edge technology. This year, the garden is partnering with the Work County School system and over 4000 students will come to the garden for education on gardening and cultivating crops. The garden has proven to be an excellent gathering place for children, youth and community members to work and learn together about cultivation and farming practices. I would like to recognize some of the guests we have. Add Commissioner Gary Black. Commissioner Black is a big fan of the community garden. He has been down there a number of times. I think Sam has you on speed, Diodate. We also have Stacy Barber. She's with Phoebe Worth Hospital. Phoebe Worth's a great partner with the community garden. We also have Janaya Green. You can see the Green Coat. She's a 4-H Club member and actually Janaya recently achieved the National Youth Action Award for her work at the garden. That's something to be commended. Last but not least, Edna Garcia-Sam's wife, who allows him to do all this for the community. Let's give Sam a big hand. Good afternoon. I want to thank Chris Evall because I was told I only had one minute. Chris Evall, I want to thank the love of my life, my beautiful wife, Edna Garcia. Thank you, baby, for like Mr. Yurtset giving me the opportunity to allow me to work for my beautiful community of Sylvester, Georgia. We have a project called the Village Community Garden and my farm manager is no other than Janaya Green. Let's give her a hand, please. Janaya Green is 16 years old. She's been with me ever since she was 11. I absolutely have to thank all of these beautiful people here from Worth County. Will you guys please stand? I want to recognize, thank you very much. They had to get up at 4 o'clock this morning to make it here. Especially the students from Worth County, I want to thank Miss Tiffany, Savannah, Xavier, Miss Pam, and also, what's the other... Oh yeah, Miss Edward, please, thank you. Miss Edward, I want to thank you guys for all the work you're doing at the Village Community Garden. If you ever down south, please visit the Village Community Garden. And Mr. Yurtset, thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. We are now going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 758. House Bill 758, there's an appallant of 30 seconds and others to be titled back to men part one of Article 3, Chapter 1 of Title 40, if it's going to George Annotated relating the Georgia Motor Carrier Act of 2012, so as to prohibit the consideration of the deployment of motor carrier safety improvements. This bill I refer to the Committee on Motor Vehicles, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you this morning HB 758. Very simple bill in its entirety only does one thing, but it has a very important impact. This bill is brought to you by the Georgia Motor Carrier Association. And what this bill does is that because of experiences across the nation, a lot of these motor carriers today are a lot more concerned about safety, whether it's requiring their drivers to take safety courses or new safety courses or to use certain new specialty safety equipment on their vehicles. And what they found is what's happening in some states is being discouraging to those independent companies is when they hire independent contractors to under their contractor to drive for them under the flag of that particular company, some of these independent contractors saying, well, if you want us to go to school or take these extra courses or whatever or put this safety equipment on our vehicles while we're driving for your company and under the flag of your company, well, that makes me an employee. And this basically clarifies that the requirement of a motor carrier, that if any of their independent contractors are contracted to drive for them, that if they say that we want you to take these particular safety courses or use this type of safety equipment, that that can't be used as a condition of employment. That ladies and gentlemen is what it does and it's kind of simple. Big glad to stand for any questions and if there are none, I'll be glad to yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. You have no questions. Gentlemen has yielded the well. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House, leader Trammell, to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, with all deference to the chairman who presented the bill, if you want to do something sneaky, you use a word that everybody feels good about. And in this case, the word is safety. We want to feel good about safety. We want to feel like that things are safe on the road. But what this bill is really about is whether truckers are classified as 1099 independent contractors or W2 employees. The basic test is pretty simple. If somebody can tell you and control how you do your job, then you're an employee. If you have the right to do it, any way you want to do it, you're a 1099 independent contractor. Now if this bill was just about taking safety courses, that might be one thing. And I want to look at the definition in line 13 about what motor, starting in line 12, about what constitutes motor carrier safety improvement. And look at this list. Any device, equipment, software, technology. So when the rubber hits the road, what this is about is being able to tell a trucker that they have to install monitoring equipment, which could be used for a whole lot of things, including the route that you take, the hours that you're on the road, exactly how you do your job, where you are looking in, supervision at all times. Does that sound like you've got the right to do whatever you want to do, the way you want to do it? No. And if you look at line 14, it says, intended and primarily used. Primarily used. But in that word, choice, it means that what about the other uses that aren't the primary use? And I would submit to you that that's what's really going on here. Because if this was about safety, we don't need a bill about safety. You know, in 2015, the issue of misclassification was something that was taken up in a subcommittee study over across the hall in the Senate. And I want to just read a few pieces of the committee findings from, and you can pull it up. It's online. It's a Senate subcommittee on employee misclassification from 2015. And part of their findings are sometimes referred to as the underground economy. Employee misclassification is the practice of designating workers as independent contractors when they should be treated as employees and afforded all the rights and benefits of an employee. And how does that intersect what we do? Well, when there is a misclassification issue, we lose out on a lot of taxes that we're supposed to be able to receive from companies who are violating the law. And characterizing people at 1099 when they should be characterized as employees. And I want to read this part of the paragraph of the next paragraph. Although the abuse is particularly prevalent in the construction and trucking industries, due to the inherent danger of the work and high cost of providing workers compensation coverage. Now this isn't an indictment of all trucking companies. The reality is a lot of them do it the right way. But when we pass legislation that puts a thumb on the scale and says that courts cannot consider whether a company installs software or a piece of equipment to tell these truckers how they can do their jobs, that that can't be considered in the determination of whether somebody is an independent contractor versus an employee. What we've done is we've put the thumb on the scale in favor of companies that are presently violating the law. And we're about to vote on a bunch of supplemental budgets that's short. And in part, one of the reasons that's short is because we have people who are misclassifying workers. That's the stakes. Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to answer any questions. You have some questions if you care to yield. I will yield. Chair recognizes representative Ridley to your right for a question. Mr. General, I yield. I've got a question on this. You talk about electronic devices. Is it not federal law that all truck drivers are required to use electronic logging device to calculate their time? If the gentleman in gentlemen states, yes, sir, it does. That's what law does. All truck drivers have to use those, whether or not driving overtime is a safety issue. That's what that's talking about in that bill. Does gentleman's father yield? I will. I think you were in the committee that had this, and I don't remember you vote no on it. When everybody voted no. Is that also correct? The gentleman is right. This was in committee. And at the time, I asked a question about what the purpose of the bill was. And reading the bill and reading what all is permitted as a motor carrier safety improvement. And my judgment this bill is about tipping the scale in favor of being able to classify individuals who are really employees as 1099 independent contractors. Well, I disagree with the gentleman. That's a reason to call him independent drivers. Thank you. Gentlemen, further you. I will. Chair recognizes the Chair of the regulated industries committee. Chairman Powell, do you write for a question? I will yield to my friend, Mr. Speaker. I will yield. You yield for his question. I do. I was trying to get a microphone that's operative. Chairman Powell probably don't need a microphone, but. There you go. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, gentlemen, he'll. I yield. I listened to you and I do appreciate your observations. I thought it was a little disingenuous to say sneaky when your next comment was that you read lines 12 and 13 that spelled out the definitions of these type of actions. But is it not true that it as you had spoke that a 1099 is clearly an independent contractor and a W2 as an employee? Is that not true? A 1099 is an independent contractor, a W2 employee as an employee. Further yield. Is it not true that if a motor trucking company, if they sign a contract with a driver as an independent contractor, but if they ask that contractor as terms of that contract, that they take specific enhanced safety motor trucking safety courses or if they put on the equipment that you referred to on lines 12 and 13, is that out of the ordinary specifications for a contract? It may be in contracts, every contract is different, but it may be an existing contracts. But what this legislation does that changes that is to say that even if you have a contract that has onerous provisions in there, that state that you have to put all kinds of equipment and there's all kinds of monitoring that the company can do of the driver.

Iber, it cannot be considered in the determination of whether someone is an independent contractor versus a W2 employee and that's a change in the law. That's what this bill reports to do. The gentleman further yield. I will. So as a distinguished attorney and you know contracts probably a lot better than most of us do or maybe not. But in the terms of a contract with an independent contractor, if the requirements is safety, and for the safety of not only the public but for the safety of that vehicle and the carrier themselves and if they require that, should that not be a term of the contract without being determined to be an employee? Well to the gentleman's question, whether or not there is a contract between a driver and a trucking company is a factor that can be considered into whether someone is a 1099 versus an employee but it's not determinative of that. So you could have a contract but you could still be an employee under the law. That's a determination when they go through the control test and they evaluate the present factors under the law, they make that determination. But this is saying is you can't consider anything in the contract as it pertains to this motor carrier safety improvement. What I'm saying is there is no reason why those factors shouldn't be considered. Further yield? I will. All right. According to your definition, and as a little look at lines 12, 3, 14, this specifies that motor carrier safety improvements, which is devices, equipment, software, technology, procedures, training, policies, programs or operational practices intended to primarily be used to improving facilitate compliance with traffic safety and motor carrier safety laws. That's generally the most important thing that any truck driver uses whether they are W2 or 1099. And if they sign a contract, which they would sign a contract to be a driver for these companies, are you saying that these basics of truck safety should not be considered as part of that contract, but in terms should be saying that they are an employee if they so wish? Well, Mr. Speaker to the gentleman's question, the parties are perfectly able to contract for whatever terms they desire. What I'm saying is the issue in this isn't really the fact that these terms exist in a contract, the issue is in the sub part B that you can't consider those at all when determining whether someone is a 1099 contractor versus a W2 employee. That's the part that doesn't make sense. And when we were talking about the definition being broad, it's literally so broad you could drive a truck through it. You're in inquiry. No pun intended of driving a truck through it. But if I might ask one last question though. I'll give one last time, Mr. Speaker. So you're saying that as an independent contractor that you freely sign an agreement stating that I'll take safety courses or I'll learn the programs or I'll use the devices or the equipment that makes my rig a better and a safer rig. And I've signed that contract freely of saying I'm an independent contractor. But if somewhere down the road it becomes convenient for me to hire an attorney to say, oh, well, I'm sorry. I didn't sign that contract to be in a 1099, but I want to be an employee now in soup for benefits. So are you saying this is really what this is about? Mr. Speaker, what I'm saying is that this is an issue that the General Assembly does not need to put the thumb on the scale and say that we cannot consider this issue of motor carrier safety improvement as it's defined, which is a very broad definition in whether someone is a 1099 independent contractor versus a W and 2 employee. There is already in place law that makes this determination. What this bill is is a preemption of the ability to consider relevant facts to that determination. And even though something may be intended or primarily used for facilitating traffic safety, it does not mean that it cannot also be used for determining the conditions of what is getting done and how it's getting done. And that is the fundamental question of 1099 versus W2. Mr. Speaker. I think that this is a matter that each and every member will have to decide for himself for herself and I would yield the well at the time. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 758 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Walensky rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that the concern is that 1099 employees can sign up in any way they choose. However, the treatment of them by the employer is the issue here and the court should have every evidence available in order to make the decision on if they are an employee or a 1099. I'm sure the gentleman believes his statement to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 758. The eyes are 99. The nays are 68. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 765. House Bill 765 by the represent of Skoggins. The 14th and others to be titled an act to amend. No 15 is official to George Annett's, either relating to courts, so is the revival of an increase in the minimum compensation for chief magistrates. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Skoggins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I bring to you House Bill 765 for your consideration. This bill will amend title 15 relating to courts. Last year the Senate and the House passed Senate Bill 171. There was also sponsored in the House by Representative Knight. This bill related to constitutional officers. This bill pertains to the Chief Magistrate judges across the state. House Bill 765 mirrors Senate Bill 171 from last year, which would adjust the minimum compensation for the chief magistrate judges. On your desk passed out a bracket. This bracket in the first column would show the population that sets the salaries for the magistrate judges and constitutional officers. The second bracket is what the salary was in 2006. The middle or the third line is what the salary is today. And the line on the right is what the proposal is for the 5% raise. So I'll ask for your favorable consideration to the bill and I will answer any questions that you may have. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Dutnik to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative, on the back row. I got you. Well, the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Two quick questions for you. One is this funded by the local municipalities or is this state funding? It's funded by local money. By local money. Yes. Okay. The second question, if you'll further yield. Yes, sir. You mentioned that this applies to the chief magistrate judges. Yes, sir. The other magistrate judges. The bill also makes reference to associate magistrate judges. Across the state, there are some probate judges that also serve as magistrate judges in the smaller counties. So this relates to all of the magistrate court judges. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You have no further questions? I yield a well. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 765, will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 765. The eyes are 142. The knees are 25. This bill, having received, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 7, I'm sorry, House Bill 292 will be postponed until the next legislative day. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 792. House Bill 792, by Mr. Ralston, the seventh and others to be entitled to amend an act, making it providing appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019 and ending June 30, 2020, known as the General Appropriations Act. This bill will ever refer the committee on appropriations. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a committee of the whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 792, the supplemental appropriations bill. The chair appoints the gentleman from the 159th District, the majority leader of the House, leader burns as chairman to preside over the committee of the whole House. Good morning, colleagues. We are in the last minute of morning and headed into the afternoon and I realize that just a little bit after the action we take, everybody will be going to lunch. So we will try to keep this as brief as possible but at the same time it is one of the most important things that we do so we want to make sure that all your questions are answered and all the information that is deliverable can be delivered as well. As we start looking at the document today you will see two different packets on your desk. One is the actual bill, one is the tracking sheet and what we will be working from is the tracking sheet itself. We also have a packet of highlights for the amended FY 2020 budget on your desk as well. But first I want to start off by thanking all of you for your time, your input, your effort and all the work that you have put into pulling this budget together as we have worked through this over the last couple of weeks. Thank you to our speaker and our House leadership for listening to our need for taking a pause to take a deeper dive and look at things more in depth. Thank you to our subcommittee chairs and the subcommittee members and the committee members as a whole for the hours of selfless service. But especially thank you to these ladies and gentlemen setting up here on the front row our staff for the House budget research office. They stay here long after we are going many days continuing to look at numbers and try to put different scenarios together and they deserve a big hand from everybody. So let's do that. Thank you all. Also thank you to Governor Kemp, his chief of staff Tim Fleming and director Kelly Farve for the help that they were to us over the last week and a half on opening the lines of communications. Not only with OPP but with agency heads and again thank you to the agency heads. Not only for their help and getting a sent information that we needed but for the job that they and their agencies do every day of the year for our great state. You know this budget is unusual in many ways from what we have had the good fortune of dealing with over the last several years. As you know the Governor had ordered a 4% reduction for the current fiscal year exempting primarily enrollment driven programs such as QBE, Medicaid and many other things that are program driven and that went into effect in some cases in October. Naturally new funding for positions or policy initiatives were the easiest things to withhold going into that scenario. However these reductions are not enough to stay within the parameters of our collections which have grown just slightly or at about 1.5% or about 203 million above where we were this time last year. We must maintain the pace we've seen from December and January in order to continue to meet where we thought we would be for the rest of the year. The slowing growth has resulted in a decrease in the revenue estimate from 27.5 billion to 27.3 billion. The gap would be even wider without the infusion of 255.7 million for the K-12 education mid-year adjustment. While the mid-year adjustment is housed in the revenue shortfall reserve program or pot it shouldn't be confused with the rainy day funds and no rainy day funds are being used in this budget. To make ends meet state funds were reduced by about 159 million or about negative 6 tenths of 1% to match the slow revenue collections. The governor's determination that the revenue estimate needs to be adjusted is the prudent thing to do. Although we found maybe the method and the messaging for executing it might have needed just a little bit of clarification as I said we have gotten that through this last couple of weeks of work. You see it needs to be pointed out and be very clear that every year we comb this budget looking for efficiencies and every year we resolve programs that are inefficient and redirect those funds to other meaningful activities or more powerful policies. And in 2018 we gave 500 million of those dollars back to the hardworking Georgia tax figures through a tax cut. Cuts are constant in good fiscal management. We don't just talk about them. They're not headline grabbers. Not nearly as uplifting as say fully funding QBE which we're doing again this year. But you know the little things that matter. We actually cut last year about 4 million dollars in property tax liability is just one thing as an example of those things that we go in and look at and cut every year. For those of you that have not experienced a cut budget you need to know that there are reductions when there are reductions that there are required that we need to find the inefficiencies but that is not the only place that we get our half to look. And that's why this process has been so intense this year. To suggest that the impact of 159 million reduction in state funds and 1255 vacant positions being eliminated or held in this budget would not be felt disingenuous. And it takes time to fully vet the long term impacts of these reductions and the competing needs. In addition to the time it takes us to do our due diligence, timing of the bill's passage is also a decision making factor in the amended budgets review. By the time the amended budget completes its legislative process and reaches the conference agreement and is then sent to the governor's assigned there is typically only one quarter of the fiscal year left to enact those changes. With nearly all agencies braced for 4% or greater reduction since October some programming and positions cannot be resurrected in time to be effective or efficient. However, greater scrutiny will be given to a wider scope of adjustments in the FY21 budget that we'll be taking up starting this afternoon. And this budget is symbolic with the FY21 because nearly every one of the reductions is repeated in the next fiscal year budget and it's incumbent for us to deliberate and be very practical about what can be reworked or restored. We're all working within the confines of a conservative revenue estimate established by our governor and we will continue to fund priorities that are directly respond to our constituents needs and demands. For us to have a solid return on their taxpayer dollars being invested in our state. Your subcommittee chairs now look forward to working with the Senate and the governor for the successful execution of these shared funding priorities and our common goals. So if you would now take your tracking sheets and we will step through the changes from the governor's recommendation on the amended budget. So in section one the Georgia Senate there are no changes there. Section two the Georgia House representatives. We will be participating in the 4% reduction plan so you'll see that reduction of $7991 there. Section three the joint offices of the General Assembly. You'll see a couple of adjustments there. One of those is dealing with the Department of Administrative Services for Insurance Premiums. Just understand that that is present throughout the budget numerous agencies so we will not call attention to that every time it shows. And you'll also 3.1.2 seen addition for Georgia to host the 2020 National Black Caucus of State Legislature's Lake Tours here in Georgia sometime this summer. Section four Department of Audits and Accounts. You'll see some true adjustments there at DOAS and then a capture of a state of some savings at 4.5.1 for a vacant position. Court of Appeals section five. And once you'll find here throughout the judiciary there are several reductions and chairman Welch and Courtney George and Brian Grume are our analysts team there, policy analysts team there and and budget analysts team there have done a great job of going through and coming through. Just as we always do through the judicial agencies is they front load their budget the Governor can't make an adjustment there so it turns to the General Assembly to make those adjustments. And so you'll see that many things that they've asked for we have said no to to look forward to potentially doing in FY21. So those things in section five the Court of Appeals including dealing and related to the statewide business court are true up to meet the actual needs there. Judicial Council under section six against some true ups for actual needs at 6.4.2 and 6.4.3. And I will note on the civil legal services while the reduction is about 275,000 there remains 475,000 in the base for that program. Section seven juvenile courts again just some true ups on that. Section eight the prosecuting attorneys and chairman Welch made this comment I think it was yesterday morning it seems like this has already been about a week and a half long in the last two days but he did make a point I would like to also give kudos to the prosecuting attorneys for coming to the table when it looked like that the public defenders were going to need to take a cut. The DA's came to the table and offered up some additional help to kind of restore the balance to the system. And chairman Welch over the years that I've served with him in the years that he's chaired the subcommittees been very good at making sure that we try to get as good a balance as we can between the prosecutors and the defenders. And again that is something that you see here. Also taking the savings from a position that was not field and then adding back for a courtier funding for a juvenile court assistant district attorney there. Section nine superior courts again some adjustments and true ups at 9.3.2 and 9.3.3. In court you'll see one change there dealing with doas as I mentioned earlier those statewide changing changes. Section 11 state accounting office one of the attached agencies there that the Georgia government transparency and campaign finance commission you'll see their restoration of funds for personal services at 11.5.2. Chairman Watson his committee felt like that it was important to restore that operating money there and then take the agree to the cut at 11.5.3 on some contracts. Section 12 DOAS no changes. Section 13 Department of Agriculture. Charity housed in her committee went through her her in lots and lots of testimony on some of the effects that some of the proposed cuts to the Department of Ag would have and you'll see at 13.2.3 they have restored effective April 1 and again I'd point back to my comments originally by the time the budget is signed by the governor there's truly only going to be about three months effective time that an agency can spool up and so that's why you'll see many of these restoration start on April 1. But they have restored funding for five food safety inspectors and two animal industry inspectors there at 13.2.3. 13.2.5 the funding to get the Georgia Hemp program started from House Bill 213 from last year under marketing and promotion at 13.4.2 reducing the cut there to allow the department to still have international trade representative on staff come April 1 and 13.4.3 restore funding for marketing materials and the Georgia Grown website development. Feel that it is important as we continue to pull out of the trough of Hurricane Michael depressed commodity prices and what we've seen with some of the trade wars going on that is important to continue to support our number one industry in this state and that being agriculture under attached agencies at 13.7.3.4 and 5 you'll see some adjustments and trough ups there under the state's soil and water conservation commission. Section 14 banking and finance no changes there. Section 15 DBH DD behavioral health cheerleading Katie Dempsey and her team have done an outstanding job on listening to you and listening to the advocates and listening to those individuals that are impacted by these programs that that DBH DD and others offer throughout our state and have gone through meticulously and made some restorations again keeping in mind that by the time everything signed we only have a short period of time for some of these things to be enacted so you'll see a restoration of about $760,000 at 15.1.2 see a restoration of a half million dollars or $500,000 at 15.2.2 as it relates to the Bobby Dodd Institute to continue to be able to serve their caseload. Moving on to section 15.4.5 you'll see a reduction in the cut there as it relates to training of our mental health workforce across the state. Many of the things that is happening, many of the programs that are being put in place by this training impact all of Georgia but especially impact rural Georgia she and her committee felt very very passionate that these things needed to be kind of put back in place. You'll also see at 15.4.6 and 4.7 additions there, $2.5 million on one line and $2.8 million on another as it relates to direct services to individuals in our state that are suffering

and different types of developmental disabilities or behavioral health issues. Moving down to 15.6.2, restoration of $750,000 there in that contract with the Marcus Autism Center. Unfortunately, that cut of 750 actually translates into a one and a half million dollar cut to Marcus because it is a one to one federal match and that would effectively limit considerably the number of individuals that they would be able to see and serve over the remainder of the year. 15.11.2, you'll see a slight reduction there on the one time funds used for curriculum development. It will have absolutely no effect or impact on the program. The curriculum has been developed, we were just able to take a savings there from the development cost. Also at 15.12.1, just the restoration of the ag career summer camp for youth with disabilities. And so we put that back in place. Section 16, Department of Community Affairs. If you look under coordinating planning at 16.2.3, that position had been vacant since April. Excuse me, August 1st of 2018, so we've taken that savings. 16.3.3, you'll see there that we've made a restoration because as it panned out through testimony and everyone, we found that there is actually no duplication of services and that that should be restored. 16.6.1, chair lady Howston felt that at this point, we didn't need to purchase the three vehicles that were being recommended there, so we've pulled that back. Under Special Housing Initiatives at 16.9.1, that contract for the most part gone out the door, so it was necessary to restore that. 16.10.3, that position has listed as vacant, but it's not vacant. The gentleman is the day we check was sitting there in his office doing his work, so that position will be vacated as of July the 1st as our understanding. A slight restoration of a small cut under the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust is 16.12.1. And then the last change under DCA is 16.16. Just noting that the one Georgia authority is the mechanism or will be the one responsible for paying the Georgia assessment for the Appalachian Regional Commission Assessment. That commission services about 37 counties in Georgia and I wish I could tell you what the return on that investment is, but it is so scattered, there are so many things that is so much good that comes out of that, it would be hard to put a dollar value on what that value would be. Under DCH, section 17, 17.4.2, we've seen the restoration of a cut of 463,000 to the Royal Health Systems Innovation Center. That program is one that this General Assembly started last year, it's housed at Mercer, and that entity is also charged with doing the hospital board training as we discussed a couple of years ago. It was necessary that many of our small rural hospitals, we have incredible folks serving on the boards there, but many times they're just not fully aware of what their fiduciary responsibilities are, and the center has taken up that and has been doing that now most of last summer and into the fall, and has been very effective in that program. Moving on to still under DCH, at 17.13, we have restored the cut that was proposed to the Mercer School of Medicine Grant, we've also restored the cut that was proposed to the Morehouse School of Medicine Grant at 17.4.1, made a partial restoration at 17.5.1 on the loan repayment program, and then also a slight reduction in the cut at 17.15.2, that deals with malpractice insurance for those docs that are practicing one in a county that we started a couple of years ago as well. Then moving on to 17.16.1, dealing with the competition payments to Emory University, Mercer, Morehouse, and PCOM, just a restoration of that competition rate where we had said it in the budget as we voted last March, and as we were leaving town. Section 18, Department of Community Supervision, there are no changes. Section 19, Department of Corrections, only a couple of changes there. If you'll look at 19.5.5 and 19.5.6, it relates to some savings we've captured where they have not yet implemented their electronic health records program, and they've encountered some of those funds not being used yet for the project. So at this point as we were cutting, we felt that it was necessary to go in and take a portion of those funds as well. 19.8.16, adjustment there on the per item pricing in the commissaries, just telling them to go to a 5 cent per item increase starting April 1st. That still leaves those items that are first selling commissaries at more than a 30% less rate than what the actual retail value out on the street is. So it's still well under the market value of what those items would be out in the public. Section 20, Department of Defense, no changes. Section 21, Department of Driver Services. You'll see one change at 21.1.5 that correlates to 21.2.7, just moving which program that those cars are in, Chairman Watson, and his committee had heard from the agency, and they felt that it'd be a little more flexible for them if they could have that within the administration programs, all of their employees would be available to use those vehicles. 21.2.3, restoring some of the cut on the security equipment that had been proposed, but it will allow camera systems for seven additional locations to be installed as a safety issue for our individuals there on the front lines issuing driver's license and IDs. Under decal at Section 22, at 22.3.5, just telling decal to use utilized existing funds to do their portion of their partnership with the Georgia Family Connection Partnership there. Section 23, Economic Development. At 23.1.3, you'll see a slight reduction for a vacant position. It's been opened since the first of January, or excuse me, first of February. Under global commerce, you'll see a partial restoration of the cut there as it relates to marketing. As I said yesterday, it's always important to market your brand and we feel very strongly about that. You'll see that evident again under 23.9.3 under tourism to allow for some marketing to continue there. We have less than that cut, but we also captured some savings from a vacant position at 23.9.4. Section 24 to the Department of Education. You'll see a small ad of 177,600 at 24.1.300 Ag Education. We need to replace some bunk beds for the camping facilities at the FFA and FCCLA camps at Covington and at Camp John Hope down outside of Fort Valley. It has become a safety issue. And unfortunately, the beds that are there are so old they're not retrofitable to allow for safety apparatus to be put on there. So we need to replace those beds. Moving on to 24.13, a capturing of vacant position at 24.13.2. Under school nutrition at 24.14.2, we're saying no to the reduction in travel funds under school nutrition. They have been doing our school nutrition folks and our counties and at DOE have been working great with the Department of Agriculture over the last couple of years. I'm doing the farm to table programs in the schools and we just don't wanna do anything to tap the brakes on that. Moving on to 24.19. It's kind of funny once we adopt a budget in committee, then there are a lot of room meals that get started quite often about things that are either in the budget, not in the budget. They've heard about being in the budget. They've heard about not being in the budget. Yada yada yada. Well, an interesting thing started popping up last night saying that we had not fully funded QBE in this budget that the cuts or the adjustments that were made under QBE under this section here meant that we were pulling back from our commitment to fully fund QBE, but I stand here today to tell you that is not the case whatsoever. As you all have been here in previous years, you've seen as the budget process started as kind of a moving target as data continues to come in, formulas continue to be run. You see the adjustment in these numbers. They kinda ebb and flow from time to time, but understand this budget fully funds QBE. Don't let anyone tell you any different. But I would also tell you again that by the time it comes back from the Senate, there may be another adjustment or two. But again, it's kinda like taking a snapshot in time today, and we'll take another snapshot in time when we get a little bit closer to the end. But understand what I'm telling you today, these adjustments still fully fund QBE. And so that's what those numbers are under 24.19 are the adjustments and true ups there. 24.20.2, I see a restoration of some of the cuts that were proposed for our recess that doing outstanding job across this state. 24.22.1, just a reduction in funds personal services to reflect a kind of a change in and reord there. 24.23.2 are state schools. I think we all understand what the schools for deaf and blind do for our children in our state. And we felt at this point that it was not the correct time to be making any reductions in their operating expenses there since we basically are their school board as the general assembly. We felt that if we're not making reductions in other instruction, we should not be making reductions there for their instruction either. Section 25, ERS, employee retirement system, no changes. Section 26, state forestry commission. You'll see some adjustments there as we've gone through and worked with director Williams and his team and trying to make sure that the things we're doing do not take them away from the frontline duties that they have. You'll see some changes, you'll see some cuts that are a little bit deeper, but you'll also see some cuts that are not quite as deep because those show us true ups. But also you'll see at 26.2.3, the restoration of some of the regular operating expenses for some of the needed maintenance that they have issues with. You'll also see some restoration at 26.3.3, also at 26.3.4, just saying to go on and make those equipment replacements because as we know, as their frontline and firefighting situation, which today, this week, last week, they're not going to be more than likely, but as we all know, as late as last October, we were still in a drought in much of this state, so at any point in time, that can change very quickly. Moving on to section 27, office of the governor. You'll see a reduction, but it's not an elimination of funds. It is a move of funds from 27.1.1 on the governor's emergency fund, taking $2.5 million from there and moving over to the Department of Law, as it relates to some pending litigation, and an example of that would be the ongoing water wars with the state of Florida. And just saying that let's put the money where we know that it's going to go, just for greater transparency and easier tracking, as we go through. Section 28, Department of Human Services. At 28.3.2, just the recognition of where some of the children's trust fund funds are being used and how they're collected. At 28.4.3, a reduction in the cut on those vacant positions, but again, running about a three-year average of 72 vacant season, just trying to true up to that actual number. 28.5.8, the restoration of 500,000 to the multi-agency alliance for children, which helps individuals, helps children that are in foster care situations, they're in the school system, be able to kind of maintain some similarity of normal life. Unfortunately, some of the cuts that were taken early on meant that Mack had to pull out of helping some of those kids about halfway through the semester. This will put them back in to help them finish out the school year. Then you'll see a reduction in kind of a true up at 28.5.11 for some vacancies. And again, true up for vacancies at 28.5.12, and then 28.5.13, it is looking now that it's going to be about July the 1st before that program will be ready to be up and running, so we've just pulled those funds back from the base. They will be in the base going forward, however. And at 28.7.5, the restoration of something, that many of us in this room is very important to us, the Georgia Memorandette Program. As you notice, I've got my purple tie on today for Alzheimer's. Sorry. That program's important to me. It's important to most of you in this room. And I'm just telling you today that if you have not dealt with dementia or Alzheimer's, yet, get ready. You will. And you're family and those that are close to you. Georgia Memorandette has done an outstanding job of getting a program set up around the state and collaboration with Emory University to help people get early identification, dementia issues, and Alzheimer's issues, because we all know that early diagnosis is the only hope that many of these patients have to live any kind of normal life for many years going forward. We still don't have a cure, but in talking with my friends at Emory, we're getting pretty close. We're getting incredibly close to having a cure. Moving on in section 28 at 28.10.4, just capturing some savings for some marketing funds that are not usable by the end of the year. 28.19.1, again, restoring our state's portion of our contribution to family connection. For every dollar in state funds, we put into it. They leverage that to bring down about $4.10 for every dollar that we put into it, into our local communities and a collaboration effort that is second to none. Section 29 Department of Insurance, you'll see in a slight savings at 29.3.4, just reflecting a change in some start dates there. Section 30, GBI, at 30.1.3, you'll see a true up there for vacancies, 30.2.3, again, a true up in the number there. Then at 30.3.2, you'll see where we're restating that these scientists and lab technician positions are to be filled and to be filled ready and ready to go April 1st. So you'll see a reduction in that cut. You'll also see an added 30.3.3 for technicians, and lab scientists at the coastal, medical examiner office down there, to get everything up and rolling there between 30.3 and 30.3.4. Under regional investigative services, see a reduction in the cut, just slightly there, as it deals with a forensic auditor position. And then a true up on the actual cost at 30.4.5, far the gang task force that has been rolled out as we speak. Under 30.5 at criminal justice coordinating council, true up on 30.5.1, at 30.5.3, as it deals with juvenile justice and centimgrants to local governments, restored that, or brought that cut down to a 4% cut instead of a 5% cut. At 30.5.5, you'll see the restoration of funds far the supplemental grants to the local accountability courts, the subcommittee, and most of you that I've talked to have felt that that was something very important for us to do, so we have done that as well. And then 30.5.6, some of the funds that are used for technical assistance provided by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities to these courts as well, it's an integral piece that is much needed. Under juvenile justice, moving down to 31.1.5, just to true up on numbers there as it relates to the youth competency beds. Then at 31.1.6, one of, hit the polls button here for just a second too. The commercial sexual exploitation of children's center opened up yesterday, it's a great thing. This is something that DJJ and the state have been working on for quite a while to implement. The idea has been around for several years. Unfortunately, it's taken quite a bit of time to get this and bring this totally to fruition. So what you'll see there, we've taken some savings, but the savings we have taken only takes the seven months from July 1, which was in the base up until January 31. So that program is fully funded for February 1, going forward to the end of the fiscal year, and it remains in the base for the next fiscal year as well. So it leaves about 167, 168,000 in the base. And then when we get back to the FY21 budget, that sets there at about $40,000, $3,000 then in base for that program. It's just one of those areas that we were going through trying to make restorations like those to the accountability courts and others that it was a place that we could capture a little bit of savings that doesn't hurt anyone and doesn't delay any type of services either. Section 32, Department of Labor, no changes. Department of Law, 33.1.3. Restoring a couple of the two critical attorney positions for the elections section that they have to make sure that they're up to speed and ready to go. Just to capture some savings in the human trafficking unit from a hiring delay. And then you'll see it 33.1.5, the two and a half million moved from the governor's emergency find over far defense in the water wars and any other pending litigation. Section 34 under Department of Natural Resources. You know, these guys, we talk about state troopers, we talk about our police, sheriff deputies and others. But a lot of times our DNR law enforcement folks get a little bit overlooked. You know, they've got blue lights on their vehicles too. And I'll just tell you, somebody told me one time, don't be fooled. They can pull you over and give you a speeding ticket too. So just be mindful of that. They're probably not going to, but just be mindful that they can. So don't be acting the fool out there. But under 34.7.3, we have restored a reduction that was proposed in their operating expenses, dealing with some replacement equipment and travel. And again, under Parks and Recs, you'll see a couple of three changes there as it relates to the Parks and Recreation Historic Sites. Understand that these are the things that we as Georgians get to enjoy. Those things that we get to go see and take our families to allow our kids to play or grandkids to play, just to take a little bit of time and relaxation. But the other cool point about it is, these are money makers for this state. This is economic development for this state. And in many places where the state parks are, or these activities are, those are things, those are big, big deals for as it relates to economic development in rural Georgia and other parts of this state. So it's important that we continue to maintain those sites and we continue to maintain them in a way that make them attractive to individuals wanting to come there. So you'll see some reduction of the cuts at 38 point, excuse me, 34.8.3 and 34.8.4. And then you'll see some one time funds at 34.8.8. If y'all didn't know, and I knew but I guess I'd forgotten at one point, we actually own a tourist railroad here in the state of Georgia's called the Sam Shortline. Runs around Cordille and America's and down and about that way. This is a state-owned rail line that we have rail banked through the years but continue to use is basically a rolling state park. Unfortunately, we have been a little short-sighted in providing some maintenance funds. They have quite a bit of deferred maintenance on that line. So it's become a safety issue. And so we're saying to put 250,000 in to help on some of that deferred maintenance. It has about 22,000 visitors down there every year and has about 25 employees. But the economic impact, about $2 million to that local area for that program and what it's doing there. Under wildlife resources 34.10. You'll see again some restoration of funds dealing with maintenance and operating. Again, the same issue on those things to keep these facilities safe and attractive for our families to go to. Section 35 under Parnson Paroles. You'll see three items there that again are merely true ups as it relates to those. Section 36 State Properties Commission no changes. Section 37 coming to the public defenders. You'll see some reduction. The reduction in the cut at 37.1.3. A true up of a cut at 37.1.4. The elimination of a couple of cuts that were suggested dealing with training at 37.1.5 and 37.1.6. And then as it deals with our PDs at 37.2.3, we're saying no to freezing those vacant positions. And also at 37.2.4, we're saying no to reducing the contracted rates that are used for contract attorneys doing public defense work. They're already on a very low pay scale and going in and making reduction there would make it either unattainable for us to get attorneys to do that work and incredibly unattractive for anyone wishing to do that work as well. Section 38 Department of Public Health. See a partial restoration at 38.1.3 to the Sickle South Foundation of Georgia. This will allow for the continued telehealth portion of the mobile testing unit as well as some additional training and educational materials and allow for them to be able to continue to maintain some case management on quite a few individuals around the state suffering from that horrible disease. 38.3.3 under Department of Administration. You'll see a true up there and you'll see that number reflected at 38.12.3 as it relates to the Fulton County Board of Health. Epidemiology 38.5. We're saying no to the cut to the Georgia Poison Control Center. However, there is a contract, planning contract that could be captured there. So at 38.5.4, just reducing that contract, but we're saying no to reducing any services rendered through the Poison Control Center. 38.12.2. Again, one of those things we heard from many of you about where the proposed reductions to the County Board of Health. So what your committee has done is restored 2.6 million to those proposed cuts. And then you'll see at 38.12.3, the move that I mentioned previously dealing with Fulton County there. At 38.12.2, we basically restored it to what remains being a 3% cut instead of the original 5% proposed cut. Georgia Tromacare Commission at 38.15. At 38.15.2, just a acknowledgement of the actual super speeder fees that are coming into the state there. It doesn't affect the bottom line. It's just the recognition of those dollars. Under public safety section 39.39.4.3 and 39.4.4, recognizing the unfortunate termination of 30 state troopers due to that scandal with the testing. So we're able to increase that reduction there and capture savings. And also capture some savings as it relates to the trooper schools and the attrition that happens through them as they go through the school. Under Firefighters Standards Training Council, you'll see just an adjustment there at 39.7.2, related to actual higher dates. And then at 39.7.4, the purchase of two vehicles that are extremely high mileage and have been letting, kind of letting folks down on the side of the road. 39.8.3, just a true up there on the vacant position at 39.8.4, the restoration of the funds in the contract and the Georgia Sheriff's Association and the police chiefs for the training that coordination that goes on there. And then under Office Highway Safety, it's kind of a clarification of use of funds at 39.10.3 and then the capturing of some vacant positions at 39.10.4. Public Service Commission Section 40, PSE took quite a number of reductions during the recession. And just as we have done through all of our state agencies, we have managed very tightly on allowing restoration of funds to many agencies. And PSE has been one of those that we've been very tight on allowing expansion of funds on. So when they were asked to participate in the 4% cuts, it became very problematic to the point that it would mean furlough days for many of their staff, including some of the public service commissioners themselves. And so what we've done there is said, you know, you've done a good job of managing your money through the years. We've kept you very lean, very tight and understand that any further reductions at this point with all the work that you have going on as it relates to vote will 3 and 4 and other things that are pending before them that those cuts needed to be restored. Section 41 Board of Regents. I'm trying to simplify this as best I can. Under Ag Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service, what Chairman Knight and his committee have done there are basically go back to the College of Agricultural Environmental Sciences and ask them for their original 4% reduction plan, the 4% cut plan. And so what we've done there is go back in and restore those areas under those two programs back to what the actual agency's submission was. Because if we were doing kind of the back of the envelope math, it was showing that these reductions were more like an 8% or 9% reduction to state funds. And it was unsustainable for those two entities. So that's what those numbers are there. Treating Farster Cooperative Extension and Farster Research, basically the same at 41.5 and 41.6. Then under Georgia Archives, taking a slight reduction, but not everything that they had offered up, not reducing funds for the operating expenses, but also under the maintenance contracts, just telling them to make sure they keep up the building. But if the grass needs to go two or three weeks about being moved, then it just needs to go two or three weeks without being moved. I know that's a simplification, but that's kind of what we're saying. Under the CyberCenter at 41.8, just to true up of some numbers.

there. Then moving on to marine resources extension, you'll see a restoration to the 4% cut plan. At 41.13.1, not sure where wires got crossed there. Those reductions were not actually to the teaching program. That was actually the money that was going out the door for the medical residence. So we've said no to that reduction there. Again, staying true to what we've been saying throughout the budget. As the importance that we place on medical education across the state. 41.14.500 public libraries restoring the per capita proposed reduction there. Getting back to or maintaining the 35 cents per capita spending level there. 41.15.3, the restoration of the cut proposed for the Georgia Youth Science and Technology Center. And then a true up at 41.15.6 as it relates to the family academy based on a later hiring date. Under skit away, just a little bit of a true up there, but also trying to lessen the cuts again in those areas of of experiment and outreach. And again under vet med at 41.19 as well. Then under GPT at 41.23, just restoring some of the operating expense cuts there. They have had a boiler. That facility is built, I think, in the early 90s. Not many upgrades have been done to the facility since then. Had one of their borrowers go out. So we're just saying that we'll restore some of the operating expense to allow them to be able to make that restoration and replacement of that board that went down a couple of months ago. Department of Revenue, if you'll look over under section 42.8.6, you'll see a restoration of some of the contractual services proposed cut there. We do a very good job in the state of Georgia collecting things that are owed to this state and trying to make the tax burden to all of our citizens fair and equitable. But unfortunately we do have individuals that try to get by would not pay what they're supposed to be paying. And we found that it's a very efficient way to go about collecting many of these debts owed to the state by using private contractors. And those that are able to do data mining and be able to look at data and understand where some shortcomings are. And in this particular cut item, it bothered our subcommittee and several of our subcommittee chairs that have been working with the Department of Revenue for several years. But I would like to tell you that for every dollar we spend here, the average return on that dollar is $12.90 for every dollar we spend using some of these private collection partners. So we made a restoration on some of that contracted funding there. Secretary of State, you'll see under 43.8 under the Access to Medical Cannabis Commission, truing up actually an addition of some funds there to get that commission established and up and running per House Bill 324 from last year. Student Finance Commission Section 44, no changes. Section 45, TRS, no changes. Section 46, TCS, G, the Technical College System. You'll see one slight adjustment at 46.6.3 under Technical Education. We had added three aviation technician positions last year, but they have staggered their start dates. So there were some savings that we could capture there. Section 47, DOT under Intermodal at 47.6.1. You just see where we're using existing funds, utilizing existing funds of $3 million under the Intermodal Program for some work at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport. They're needing to expand the runway there in pretty quick fashion, have a major economic development partner looking to come in, but they've got to have a little bit more room to land. And also, Robyn's Air Force Base, of course, is pretty much out of room for expansion. And so they're starting to send out or contract some of that work out to offsite locations, and this allows that to happen there. Department of Veterans Services Section 48, no changes. Workers comp, Section 49, no changes. Then Section 50, something that you seldom ever see us do in an amended budget deals with a bond. And I will just tell you that at 50.1.3 and 50.1.4, we've got some information and we're still trying to sort through what's going on there with that particular project. But initially, two years ago, we'd placed a bond in the budget to build a facility, a regional youth detention center, Inglonette County. There's been some concern and some consternation, maybe, on getting a site established for that to happen. The bonds were sold. We've already gone into what is called arbitrage. So there's certain spend down targets to have to be hit. It was recommended initially by OPB that the Georgia State Propagies Commission vote to redirect that bond to some different projects with NDJJ. But we've felt and feel very strongly that a bond that size, that many dollars in a project like that deserves the scrutiny to come back before this general assembly. It's at least be seen as a proposal is done. And I know and working with Chairman Eftration, and I know he's been on the phone over the last day or so with his folks in Glonette County. Hopefully we're kind of breaking the log jam or the ice layer of ice or whatever it's been and making some headway on actually getting that center built in Glonette County. But we felt that it was important to put it on the table here so that everybody understood we were discussing it and it was important to this general assembly to have that discussion. So that, Mr. Chairman, that concludes the walk through the tracking sheet. I'll be glad to attempt to answer any questions anyone may have. Well, Mr. Chairman, it's usual that was pretty exhaustive. But very thorough. Yes, I am. Very thorough. And for you new members, how many bottles of that take there, Mr. Chairman? That's the first sip I'm having. Wow, I thought you were holding your breath and going on. I will. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, just a comment, then a question. As always, thank you to your staff, a very professional job, and to the members of the subcommittees and all the committees of appropriations. Thank you for your work on this bill. And Mr. Chairman, I can always and all of your stewardship of the people of this state's hard earned money. The treasure, Mr. Chairman, as you addressed needs this state just a, can you continue to thank you for your work on that issue? Thank you. The question I would have, Mr. Chairman, is that we've heard lots of discussion about this budgetary process that we've begun with this amended budget. But is this much different, if you will, in the ab and flow of information and the process between the House and the Senate and the Governor's Office of Executive Branches you've dealt with over the years? So is this pretty much some different, but pretty much in line? That's pretty much in line. I mean, every administration is going to be a little different and want to handle things a little bit different. And I respect that. And I think we all do. You have teething pains sometimes, and we may have had a few of those. But, you know, for the most part, our Governor said in the Senate, the Governor said over there as a member of the Senate and voted on several budgets during that time. So he understands the process and understand that, you know, different administrations have different ideas on how things work or how they want to make things work. And I understand that and respect that as well. Well, Mr. Chairman, I can tell you, I appreciate how you're working with everyone and all concerned parties on this budget for your work with people this state. Mr. Chairman, did you say you would take a couple of questions? Yes, sir. So this time the chair would recognize the gentleman from the 17th representative Montaghan. For our question. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for all the incredible work on this budget. You know, I know that hours and the totaling that you all have gone over this, and so I appreciate that. But I didn't want to ask you a quick question. That was, it had come to my attention late yesterday that the funding for the CSEC, which is a commercial sexual exploitation center known as the receiving code in my district, just had how they ribbon cutting as you had defined earlier had been removed. But after hearing your description and reviewing your prepared budget online 31.1.6, it seems that the center is funded appropriately from its opening through the end of the fiscal year. Isn't that true? Yes, sir. It is. So if it wants to, this budget continues to go through the process, we find out information to the contrary. We'll be sure to adjust for that and make adjustments in necessary. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for all your hard work. I know that you've got to watch while this, and there's no much rest more than you on these issues. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, to your left, Chairman, illustration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for your presentation, Chairman England, and your hard work, the tireless work of your staff to present the budget here today. Isn't it true that the transfer provisions and the general obligation bonds are really a transparency measure to show transfers that are to be made that are recommended, but that this house and you and your committee understand the critical need for an RYDC in Gwinnett County, and we intend to continue to work in the state senate through the conference process and the budget process to ensure that that need is met. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, the general lady from the 139th District representative mentally has a question. Mr. gentlemen, you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work on this budget. My question is relating to family connection. Can you share with me again what exactly was done relating to family connection? I kind of missed that. The restoration of the proposed cuts, there were two different places where that was proposed. One is in decal and the other one helped me out, but anyway, both of those restorations were made. Okay. Yes. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you for the question and thank you for the answer. Mr. Chairman, a question from the House District 56 representative Thomas. Representative Thomas to your left. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the details of the budget. I just want to be clear, and I do thank you for family connection being restored as well, because I know about that agency. But what I want to know is that in the beginning, you said that the DAs got together and in some other words, what my concern is is whether or not the cuts that were made to the public defenders council, how much was put back in if there was some change in that particular line? They were restored. Those cuts to the public defenders were restored. And what I was saying, the folks on the prosecution side realized that without the defense side being there, they can't move cases. And so Chairman Weitz, I came to Chairman Weitz and his committee and said, we need to we need to help write the ship or balance up. So we're willing to take some cuts and take some hits here in order to help over here, because if we don't have folks standing on the other side of the desk in a courtroom, then we can't move cases at all. But those restorations were made. Okay, thank you. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Chairman, that was a great adjustment. Mr. Chairman, believe it or not, you don't have any more questions. So I think you, I think you, that lunch bill is ringing louder or you did a very fine job as I know you did of explaining your work and the committee's work. Well, no further questions. Understanding that, I figured probably everybody's more hungry than anything. I doubt my ability to explain and sometimes the stomach overrides the ability to listen. So I will hush and get out of the well and ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you all. Thank you for your attentiveness last week and the latter part of the week before on being these hearings, whether you're on the committee or not. Thank you for being a part of this process. I think I've had many of you come up to me and tell me just how much that even though you've been on the committee for years, how much more you see and understand about what many of our agencies do around the state and the dedication of employees that we have in our agencies. And so thank you for being a part of that process. And thank you for allowing us to be a part of this process as well. You're the well. The gentleman has yielded well. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. We're all indebted to you for your thorough work and your willingness to speak to each one of us on issues and impact the people of Georgia. The chair at this time would recognize Chairman England for a motion. Mr. Chairman, I move that the House Bill 792 do pass by committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The motion's been made that House Bill 792 pass do pass by committee substitute is their second. Recognize the gentleman from the 33rd Chairman McCall for a second. Mr. Chairman to reiterate what you have said previously each and every one of us in this House needs to be appreciative of the appropriations committee, especially those of us from rural Georgia and especially to the House budget staff. So I would gladly second the motion of my seatmate, Chairman England. Mr. Chairman, I know you've heard a couple of these budgets over your year's history. Thank you for that second and your acknowledgement of a job well done. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this time we'll call the question on House Bill 792. All in favor we'll say aye. All opposed, no. No doubt the ayes have it. House Bill 792 passes by committee substitute. All in favor recognize the gentleman from the 116th Chairman England. Mr. Chairman, there we go. Mr. Chairman of the whole House, you're instructed to report the action of the Committee of the whole House to the House. The chair recognizes majority leader Burns. Mr. Speaker, the Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 792. He has instructed me as its chairman to report the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 792 do pass by committee substitute. The report of the chairman of the Committee of the whole House has received. The Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 792 and has reported the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 792 do pass by committee substitute. The Committee of the whole House is hereby dissolved. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I'm very cognizant that everyone has been patient and sat through a great presentation and that lunch approaches. But I would be remiss if I let this opportunity pass without asking this question. Because in a day where unemployment is at record lows and the economy is doing very well, we are about to vote on an amended budget where we are cutting Georgia's budget. How do we get here? You know, publicly traded companies periodically on a quarterly basis do things they call earnings calls. And they do forecasts about projections about what they're going to make. And on those calls sometimes they have to report that things didn't come in the way that they expected or anticipate. And that's called an earnings miss. And investors are very, very unhappy when there's an earnings miss because something is a muck in the company when that happens. So the headline coming out of this budget vote in part should be that we had a revenue miss for fiscal year 2020. And that should concern each and every member of this house because revenue misses are a big deal. And the $159 million that we are about to cut in this supplemental budget aren't just dollars and cents. They have names and they live in each and every one of our districts. And if we haven't heard from those constituents yet, you can bet in the next year we'll hear from them. And the question will be why did we have to cut when times were so good? And if you're prepared to answer that question and you've got a good explanation, then you can vote green and your conscience can be clear. But if you don't have a good explanation, I would recommend that we as a house have to look at the structural debt and the tab that we are paying for improved choices that we have made as a body in recent years. The state economist told us at the beginning of the budget process, the appropriations process that as a consequence of a tax cut in 2018, we are now $500 million lighter in state revenues as a result. And what we are about to pass on is paying the tab on that tax cut. And in the general appropriations for fiscal year 2021, we'll have to pay a second tab. The choices we are making in this budget and we'll make with 2021's fiscal budget are choices that we're supposed to have to make when times are tough. And when times are tough, belt tightening is expected and everyone anticipates it. But the bad news is that we're having to cut when times are good. And you know what, when times get tough, we'll have to cut again. And one of that I will struck with is the testimony in subcommittee hearing after subcommittee hearing heard words like safety net and heard citizens coming and advocacy groups saying, please don't cut, please restore the funding. And the other thing that troubles my heart today is that we have a rainy day fund of nearly $3 billion. Capital that we have set aside. And you know, we call it the rainy day fund, but you know what it's called in statute, is defined in statute at OCGA 45-12-93, the revenue shortfall reserve. And that's what we got, a revenue shortfall. So when we vote on this budget, we'll have to be able to explain the constituents, how did we get in this situation? And why are we making cuts when we have capital that could be deployed sitting on the side for rainy day? And there may be members in this body that say, oh Mr. Leader, it's not raining. But I'm going to tell you something, the roof is leaking. So it is our constitutional duty to pass a budget and to pass on the amended budget. But that is the necessary condition. Is it sufficient? Is this the best budget we can do for Georgia? We can do better. Georgia's deserve better. Mr. Speaker, I yield well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on House Bill 792? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 792 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 792. The eyes are 126. The nays are 46 and this House has passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 20. Let me add, before we start scattering here a little bit, regardless of how you voted and how you feel about the budget, I don't think I've ever been prouder of an appropriations committee in the years that I've been honored to serve in this position. They worked extremely hard. What purpose does Chairman Hawkins rise? Stature motion. Chairman Hawkins has moved that House Bill 88 be recommitted to the special committee on quality health care, clerk will read the caption. House Bill 88 per version of Hawkins, the 27th and others to be entitled to amend, title 33, the Fiscal Year of Georgia, annotated relating new insurance, so to provide for certain consumer protections against surprise billing. On the gentleman's motion that House Bill 88 be recommitted to the special committee on quality health care, is there objection? Is there objection that Chair here is none? And it is so ordered. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.
