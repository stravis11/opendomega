TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome. We are going to go ahead and get started.
Thank you all so much for coming out today. I'm Darcy Robb. I am the Executive Director of the
Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities. We are here, myself and this staresful of advocates
because right now, today, it is legal to pay some hard-working Georgians less than minimum wage.
That is legal in our state as of today. Now, I want to point out, there are no private companies
in Georgia. No private companies are doing this. No. We have eight disability service providers
that have a special certificate from the federal government known as 14C.
14C allows those providers to employ Georgians with disabilities, but they're paid less than
minimum wage. Now that is made possible by an antiquated federal law known from the federal
Fair Labor Standards Act. Not every state does this. Right now 13 other states have stopped
allowing sub minimum wages to be paid. Georgia is going to be the next one. But
right now we still have 14 C. And so that means right now about 250
Georgians with disabilities are being paid below minimum wage. There is no
low limit. There's no there's no floor unless y'all. There's no bottom on what
you can pay someone. And so there are documented cases of people being paid as
low is $0.22 an hour. You heard that right. $0.22 an hour. So on one hand, you have that.
On the other hand, you have other Georgians with disabilities all over the state who are
building careers and pursuing education. And many of those are the folks standing right
behind me. Yes, please give them a round of applause. We have advocates across
Georgia. You're going to hear from the sister of one of them later today who
were being paid sub minimum wage because someone had told them you can't do
any better. That is a lie. That is a lie. The young man that you're going to
here about today has been working in a competitively paid job for some time now.
And there are people all across Georgia doing the same.
We know it is possible for everybody to be in the right job with the right support.
You have people like our inclusive post-secondary education students, many of whom are here today.
They attend college along with their peers.
They have internships.
They participate in social life.
And when they complete their education, these young people will go on to build careers at
fair wages as they should, because we are living in a world in a state where we know that
education and careers are possible for all people.
And to help make that promise a reality for all Georgians, I'd like to introduce Senator
Billy Hickman to speak about his legislation.
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being here.
What a great crowd.
I'm proud to stand here with over 200, I think it's more than 200, advocates to introduce
a bill called the Dignity and Pay Act, which will help ensure that every work in Georgia
earns a fair wage for the work they do.
Right now, a law called Section 14C,
which I was not aware of until we got involved with this.
14C, as the Fair Labor Standards Act,
allows community rehab providers to pay workers
with disabilities less than minimum wage rates.
Sometimes it's little is just a few cents an hour.
This law is outdated and unfair.
It seems a wrong message about what people with disabilities can achieve and the value
of their contribution to our economy and our communities.
Last year, along with a lot of people, I worked very hard to pass the Georgia as a model
employer act, coming in front of the game bill, which made our state a leader in hiring
people with disabilities for state jobs.
legislature show what people, what's possible,
what we invest in talent, break down barriers,
and focus on competitive jobs for people with disabilities.
In fact, in the Senate, we have a lady named Martha
that started last week for last, who works in our refreshments.
That's a part of this game bill.
The game bill, what we said was we could not expect people in Georgia
independent business in Georgia,
hire people with disabilities
if the state of Georgia was not willing to hire people.
And that's what the game bill is.
Now it's time to take the next step.
They make sure no work in Georgia
regardless of disability is paid less than they deserve.
The dignity and pay act
were in the use of sub-minimal wages
by community rehab programs in Georgia by 2027.
We know this can work. Only eight of the hundreds of community rehab programs in Georgia still
pay less than minimum wage. And all traditional business here in Georgia, the higher people
with disabilities, pay them fair wages. It's not right. These companies prove every day
that inclusion is not just the right thing to do. It's good for business also. Our bill
is about fairness. It's clean and it's simple. It's about giving everyone the chance to
earn a living wage and showing that we value the work and contributions of every Georgian.
I'm very grateful to the advocates, to the families, and many organizations who push
for this change for years. Your voices have made this possible. Your determination has made
possible. Together we're keeping Georgia the best place to work, live, and do
businesses for all people. Thank you and I look forward to working with my
colleagues in the Senate in the House to pass the Dignity and Pay Act this
session. Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I'm going to try to get through this without crying, but it's probably not going to happen.
This is my brother, Trey, St. Pierre.
He's 36 years old, and I'm his sister, Crystal, St. Pierre Stackpole, here on behalf of him.
he couldn't be here today. Why you might ask? Because he's at work.
This is a picture of him at Zach's piece in our local area in Ringel, Georgia. He's
been there for five years. He works as a team member about eight hours a week, getting
can pay competitive pay rate just like his other employees.
When trade first graduated Lafette High School in 2011, the only option that we were given
is for him to attend a supported workshop, where he worked on sifting through garbage,
pulling out recycling, and a warehouse that was not heated or cooled.
My brother's pay rate, we did not know at the time because my mother and I didn't understand
what that meant, was that his pay would be based on how fast he could sit through the
garbage and pick out certain pieces of recycling.
Sometimes his pay rate would be as high as maybe $1.5 an hour and it was even as low as
two cents per hour and could change twice a year based on that time test.
Tray was not given the opportunity to know
when that time test was.
His supervisors would just observe him, collect the data,
and then alter his pay without informing him.
After my brother was working at this sheltered workshop,
it had been about three or four weeks.
My mother and I had realized that he hadn't brought
a paycheck home for a while.
And then when we talked to his job coach
at the sheltered workshop,
They said he threw it in the trash.
And he threw it in the trash because for two weeks pay,
he brought home two pennies.
After sitting down with my brother
and understanding what happened,
he told me he wanted to quit
and that he wanted to get a job like Sissy had.
So he sat down at the kitchen table
and we made a list of five different places he wanted to work.
One of those places was a minor league baseball team
called the Chattanooga Lookouts
because we live in Northwest Georgia.
Funny enough that job fair was the weekend
prior to the time that we sat down to make that list.
And so we went to the job interview
and they hired him on the spot.
No need for support, no need for coaches.
They were just happy to have trade there.
He worked there for five seasons
and then after five seasons, COVID hit.
So then trade came to me and said,
I wanna job, I can have year around
because as we know, baseball is seasonal.
So we utilize vocational rehab
where he got a job at Zach Spees
and he's been there for five years
working competitive, right.
Trey feels like he's a part of his community.
He calls his Zach Spees co-workers,
his Zach Spees family,
and he looks forward to going to work every day.
It is his favorite day of the week
when he gets to go on Wednesdays and Fridays.
Getting that paycheck for two cents,
really hit tray, even though he wasn't able to verbalize to me what it was, but I could
tell that it reflected his value.
And he knew that he was worth more than two cents per hour, and now he comes home with
only working the eight hours a week, but he comes home with $180 every two weeks.
As my brother was here, he would introduce himself to you, just like he does his co-workers
and the customers that come into Zaxby's, and he'd tell them, hi, my name is Trey.
I have Down syndrome.
Don't limit me.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Hey, my name is Quinn Jackson. I live in Tilton, Georgia.
I believe every citizen in Georgia has the right to work at a job.
They want to be paid a living wage that mean people should be valued for the work they do and should be paid at least minimum wage and
Certainly not self minimum wage. I have a job that pays be 15 hours 15 dollars an hour and fiscal hours
Because they could trick the value of me my skills. It doesn't make any sense to me
That when people put their time into working employers think it's okay to pay
them less than minimum wage. I believe that it is dispatched from
incredibly to me because other jobs like McDonald's, Burger King,
South Wave, Wendy's, ZXPs, and other restaurants are making $12
a hour or more. What's best for self-elkies and other people like us
is to insult minimum wage. It's time for us people with disabilities
have equal access, representation, and opportunities.
We can do better just like people who fought for our worker rights
In the 1800s, worker protested for higher wage,
safer working conditions, and reduced hours.
Then again, a 40-hour shift on weekends was virtually
unheard of in the US until people stood up for worker rights.
Now in Georgia, in Florida, could teach paid workers
with disability, a sub-minimal wage,
at less than 22 cents per hour,
most than less than the current federal rate, minimum wage,
$7.25.
As nearly, 2023, 80% of disabled Americans over the age of 16
were unemployed and partly due to the pay of difference.
On behalf of all self-evils and representatives
of the United for Change, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm asking for you to listen to your heart and soul
in both years on HB 1125.
And let's get rid of self-minimum wage.
Thank you.
that we can't do this.
Well good afternoon, yeah let's try that again let's see if y'all can
and respond back, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Yeah, so listen, I'm looking at all of you,
I know who have poured so much of yourself into this work
and to helping people with disabilities,
whether it is to help them get an education,
or to be employed, or just to take the next step.
And I wanna say thank you.
Your work matters, your voice is matter here
at our state capital, but who I really wanna talk to,
Are these people right up here?
I'm gonna see if I can move this a little bit
where I can see y'all.
So let me ask you something.
Raise your hand if you're in college.
Come on now, come on now.
How incredible Georgia leads the way right now in that.
An inclusive post-secondary education.
Many of you who are parents may have never thought
that was a possibility.
It's a reality.
And these young people up here,
they are knocking the top off of every roof
in every school they go to.
Let's give them a hand.
Woo!
Woo!
For those of you who are in the program,
and those of you who are peers and supports,
and who help others be in the program,
it is so important.
That education is one of the pathways
to Senator Hickman's bill as well.
It all works together.
So to each of you, I want to encourage you.
I want to tell you how special you are behind me
because you've taken hard steps to get to this day,
but your independence, your perseverance matter so very much.
So thank you for coming to make others aware of what you're doing and how much more we can help you continue to do it and even bigger and greater ways.
Persevere.
I don't necessarily want to hold it.
That'll work.
Good afternoon.
Let's do that again.
I feel so powerful.
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for being here.
My name is Wendy Dean and I'm honored to speak about
Why Georgia is uniquely positioned to phase out Section 14C of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
This provision allows the payment, as we've already heard, of sub-minimal wages to people with disabilities.
First, let's acknowledge the incredible infrastructure Georgia already has.
Our state has a strong developmental disabilities network.
Our D.D. Network, which is made up of Georgia Advocacy Office, the Georgia Council for Developmental Disabilities,
the Center for Leadership and Disabilities at Georgia State University and the Institute on Human Development
and Disabilities at the University of Georgia are impeccable.
These entities work collaboratively to promote the inclusion, independence, and rights of people with disabilities.
This network fully supports the transition from sub-minimum wage practices toward competitive
integrated employment for all Georgians.
Today there are still 714 C certificate holders in Georgia paying approximately 250 people
with disabilities at wages far below the federal minimum. Let's be clear, sub-minimum wages
are a relic of the past. They perpetuate low expectations and reinforce segregation,
leaving workers undervalued, excluded, and without real opportunities for advancement.
It's time for this to change.
Thank you. Our state's history reminds us why this issue is so urgent.
Georgia has, Georgia was the birthplace
of the landmark Supreme Court case,
homestead versus LC,
which affirmed the right of people with disabilities
to live and work in the most integrated setting,
appropriate to their needs.
Continuing to allow sub-minimum wages under Section 14C
undermines this principle,
keeping people with disabilities in segregated,
sheltered workshops instead of empowering them
to pursue competitive integrated employment.
Federal policy has already begun shifting in the right direction.
The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act
establishes competitive integrated employment
as the gold standard for people with disabilities.
As the Department of Labor's recent notice
a proposed rule making highlights,
The employment landscape has improved dramatically since 1989 when these regulations were last
updated.
Today, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is at a historic low and the
number of workers under 14 C certificates has plummeted.
From over 420,000 in 2001 to fewer than 45,000 in 2024, this shows us that we really don't
need sub minimum wage and that people can work being paid fair wages.
As the state, Georgia is already for this transition, the tools and expertise already exist
to support employers and individuals in moving to a model of competitive integrated employment.
Many states, it was mentioned earlier, 13, in fact, have enacted legislation to phase
out 14C, demonstrating that not only is it possible, but it's successful. These states
have shown that with the right support in place, individuals with disabilities can thrive
in meaningful, well-paid employment. Finally, I want to emphasize that the U.S. Department
of Labor's proposed three-year phase out period is more than sufficient. The conversation
around ending 14C has been ongoing for years and many employers have already begun adapting
to this inevitable change. With the support of Georgia's DD network and the resources
available through state and national incentives, we can ensure a smooth and successful transition.
In closing, I urge all of us to embrace this opportunity to create a more equitable workforce.
A phasing out sub minimum wages, Georgia can honor its commitment to inclusion, independence,
and equal opportunity for people with disabilities.
Together, we can ensure that every Georgian has the chance to work, contribute, and earn
fair wages.
Thank you.
All right. That comes to the end of our featured speakers. Thank you all so much. We want to open it up now and see if there are any questions.
Okay, well that's a great question, what would be our message to other lawmakers about
coming to the table and supporting this legislation? Senator Hickman, do you want me to take
a stab at that or do you want to take that one?
So her question was what would be the message to other lawmakers about why they need to come
the table and support the legislation.
I really don't think, be honest with you, I don't think we're going to have an issue.
You know, the second signer on this bill with me was Senator Drew Eccles.
And Senator Eccles has got an autistic son, so I think that when people, when we learn
more and more, and I really don't foresee it as an issue.
I'm really excited about it, we're going to push it hard, and I really don't see it
issue. Yeah. I don't. I don't. You never know what's going to pop up, but I don't. Thank
you for the question. Any others? We must have made ourselves crystal clear. Everyone
understands about the importance of getting rid of sub-minimum wage. Okay. All right.
Okay. I'm sorry. Can you repeat it one more time?
So the question was how do we make sure that these types of pay disparities don't happen
in the future?
I think the legislation is really the cornerstone of that because right now, you know, minimum
wage has been the law in this country for a long time.
This is a law from the 1930s, a federal law that carved out specific groups of people.
So once it's illegal here in Georgia, like it is in 13 other states, that last little
handful of providers who are currently paying people below minimum wage, they're going
to stop doing it because it's going to be against the law.
Now I think what people go to after that is, and we have this happening already, y'all,
We know now how to support people in competitive integrated employment.
There is a gentleman, and I have permission to share his story by the name of Chad Roberts
up in North Georgia.
Significant impact of multiple disabilities doesn't speak very much in words.
Everybody in this young man's life thought he would go to a sheltered workshop or an
adult daycare for the rest of his life.
His mother did not.
He has worked ever since he's gotten out of high school.
And it turns out that when you are meticulous and you like to work with your hands, that
is a very big advantage when it comes to working in an organic greenhouse.
He also works for multiple law firms shredding their documents.
We know you just have to be creative.
We know that you can design a career for everyone.
There is entrepreneurship.
The biggest business incubator for people with disabilities in the country is located
right here in Georgia.
It's called Synergy's Works.
We have all these options.
There are no more excuses for people not to all be able to build individual careers.
That was a long answer.
I had a lot of thoughts.
That's a good question.
How do we ensure people have access to all these services and supports?
We keep advocating and we keep trying to inform people of what's available.
We make sure that people know their rights when it comes to asking for what support they
need in schools, IEPs, 504s.
We make sure people know about inclusive post-secondary education.
We encourage people to go to Georgia's technical schools, universities, internships.
We make sure people know to connect with the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency
and advocate for their needs, for their jobs, to connect with DBHDD, and to get waivers
or to get family supports.
I think it's just educate, advocate, advocate.
All right, y'all, unless any other speakers would like to wrap us up with some inspiration,
I think we will close that on today.
I hope you all see what's possible,
and please keep talking to your elected officials.
Let them know what the community needs.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
