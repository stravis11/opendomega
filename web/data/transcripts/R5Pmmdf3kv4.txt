All right, we're about to have the morning roll call.
We are about to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines nor keepers will
please close the doors and keep them closed.
Well, good morning.
Hope everybody is happy and healthy today.
We will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the Chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 134th House District,
the chairman of the House Rules Committee, chairman Richard Smith, chairman Smith.
Thank you, Speaker. I told somebody other day that my pastor was going to be here today and
And they looked at me and said, well, you know, we didn't think you had a heart.
But now we know, you know, it's even worse now that we think you have a pastor.
So it's, uh, it's kind of, if you, I talked to the little lady yesterday,
who had, uh, came in with her father, a pastor, and I asked her, I said, you know,
what my favorite word is? She said, no, I said, it's no.
And her dad said, well, that's my favorite word too.
And she said, yeah, that's right.
You know, I know everybody in here has heard the story of the turtle sitting on top of
a fence post and that they always had to have somebody help them get there.
And I think everyone in this room can identify folks in their life who met that criteria
of helping you get to where you are now.
And I dare say that, of course, now I'm a little older than most of you, our Williams.
But I can list four or five people that were instrumental in my life to bring me here
and to help me in a whole lot of other ways.
been very fortunate and I want to tell you about two groups. One group is a group that
helps me professionally and the other group is the one that helps me with my faith and
it's a unique opportunity when you have one person who fits in both categories and my
Pastor Jimmy Older is that individual? I'm on the sit-down for you know I
hear to listen to me. Jimmy Older pastor first bad discharge in Columbus he
told me just just introduce me here's Jimmy so here's Jimmy.
Mr. Speaker, you're a friend to Muscogee County.
Thank you so much.
Chairman Smith, members of the House of Representatives,
friends, it is my distinct honor to be here.
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
This is a place of history, a place that has inspired
my life, all of my life.
Those who sat at these desks are the ones that
have touched my life in a very special way.
of my host, Richard Smith, I'd say he is my friend,
he is my parishioner, and he's a statesman
that I respect and deeply love.
He's made an indelible mark on our community,
both as citizen and representative.
He is largely responsible for the Chattahoochi Valley
Community Foundation.
He also is largely responsible for the Mercer
school of medicine, location there, and you have been so generous to fund it, and we're
so grateful for that. Thank you so much for that.
Richard epitomizes servant leadership. And, you know, from my childhood, I've loved
government, I've loved the governance system, I've loved being involved in any way I possibly
could, wanted to be as close to it as I possibly could. To the point that as a little kid,
I wanted to grow up in the governor of Georgia.
I really did.
And it was an aspiration, a desire of my heart
that's been there all of my life.
I followed the work of government so closely
that I've been privileged to know or to meet
10 of the 13 people who served as governor of this state
in my lifetime.
I mean, I work to do that.
I've known representatives, I've known senators,
I've known national people in Senate and House.
I've known a couple of presidents.
I've had an opportunity to do this,
but that's the passion of my life.
I enjoy this.
It's been important to me.
It was not a matter of power as a kid.
I looked at it as a way to really help people,
a place where you can go and serve
and you can make a difference
and you can change people's lives.
It's a wonderful kind of experience.
One day somebody who, recently, who knew of that,
desired my heart and had known me for many years,
came up and said, well, you know, you're getting older,
said, when you retire, you're going to run for office
somewhere.
And I heard myself say the unthinkable.
I said, no, I said, the dream is gone.
I said, my childhood dream, that which I had hoped for,
is really gone now.
And it caught me off guard to hear myself say that,
Because over the past years, it has been dreamed out of me
in some way or another by so many things that have happened
and so much of the pressure that's been out there
and the literal and things that have been in place.
I found myself saying I wanted to go from it
rather than toward it, but the thing that disturbed me more
than anything else was the feeling that I had
that if it could do that to a dream I'd had all my life,
what is it doing to other people?
So I went and I read from a favorite passage of scripture and it's way too long for me
to share with you today the whole passage, but let me just capsule it for you.
The story is of Eli who is the judge in Chalo, the high priest at Chalo.
He also was the second to the last judge before Israel had kings.
As a judge, as the priest, he was kind of the seat of not only government, but also the
seat of religious influence within that place.
He was the kind of man who had served with distinction and was a person that people honored,
but he had kids who were not committed and were not called to the task.
They began to take power and try to seize it and use it for themselves.
They began to cause conflict and problems.
this mix add that there was a couple who wanted to have a baby. They wanted to have a boy.
And so Elkina and Hannah begged the Lord to please give them a son. And Hannah said,
if you give me a son, I'll dedicate him to the Lord. I'll always dedicate him to the
Lord. And for the Lord's service. And Samuel was born. And when Samuel was born, she did
exactly what she said, she took him to the high place, to Eli, to be a servant there,
and to grow up under his tutelage, to grow up under his influence, and with idealism,
and with call, and with purpose, Samuel went to that place, and really wanted to serve.
It wasn't power, it was service.
saddest part of the scripture though is it says that in those days the voice of
the Lord was silent and there were no visions. It wasn't because the Lord wasn't
speaking, it was because nobody was listening. It wasn't because God didn't want
to give visions, it was because no one paid attention to them. And here was
Samuel who was in the mix, he were Eli's sons who were causing all sorts of
problem and he was Eli caught right in the middle of it all. And so one night
Samuel was asleep and the Lord called him Samuel Samuel and Samuel thought it
was Eli so he got up and he went to Eli and he said here I am what can I do for
you? Eager to serve. And Eli said I didn't call you. So go back to bed and again it
happened and again it happened the third time that voice came and Eli and Samuel
got up, went to Eli and said, here I am, you called me and then Eli heard it in his
own heart. I'm the priest. I should have known this. This should have been my first
thought. Samuel, that's the Lord speaking to you. When you go back and lie down, if he
comes to you again, simply say, well, this is what he said. The Lord came and stood there
calling as at other times Samuel, Samuel.
And then Samuel said, what Eli told him to?
Speak, Lord, your servant is listening.
In short, two things had to happen to change the path
down which Israel was going.
Eli, who was birded over his sons,
knew that something had to happen with them,
but he hadn't been powerful enough or strong enough
to do anything about him.
And Samuel had to be inspired.
inspired to take that idealism and those ideas and to bring them to a place where he could
influence others. So when he went back to bed, Eli was essentially turning it over to Samuel.
Don't ask me, tell the Lord you're ready to listen to him. He lay down, the Lord spoke,
and Samuel responded, speak Lord, your servant is listening, and when he did, the Lord
kind of unloaded at that point. The Lord spoke again. The vision was there.
Eli was judged, so were his sons. Eli was a pivotal part of this, though,
because he had to inspire Samuel to do the right thing. Find the call, follow it.
Each of you here serve people of Georgia, but I believe there's an underlying and more
important call for you and for me. Instead of allowing the dream and idealism of people
to be crushed by the atmosphere that has developed in the political arena all across the spectrum.
We need to rise to a level of inspiring young people to service, encouraging their idealism,
grooming them for service, for generations to come. We need to be a voice of inspiration that tells
them, have them go and say, speak, we're listening, there's something we can do, those simple words,
Speak, Lord, for your servant hears you.
Become the cry of hope for the future.
That's all God wants.
He wants to hear us, hear Him.
He wants us to call to Him,
and He wants us to sit and listen when He speaks.
It's time for the silence to be broken.
We need to dream again.
We need to believe again.
We need to step up and serve again
to offer ourselves in service again.
Not just for the purpose of politics,
for offering God faithful integrity-based committed public service. If we don't, we leave the leadership
to the sons of Eli, the ones who don't hear the voice of God. If we do, we inspire the
Samuels to come forth. Do you know what Samuel ended up doing? He was the last judge,
the last one to serve in that position. He anointed two kings of Israel.
He's considered the first of the prophets. He was a priest. He's remembered for his prayers,
and he laid the groundwork for the later priesthood. What would have happened if he hadn't been
inspired? What if his dream had been drained out of him? What if he had lost that passion,
that desire to do something and to listen? But Eli inspired him. Speak, Lord, your servant is
hearing. That's what God is calling out from our midst. He's calling you whom we
have placed in service to always consider your place in inspiring others to
serve. Never doing anything or conducting yourselves in any manner that would
destroy the innocence of young people or run them from the dream of public
service. We need them on the local, state, federal, international level serving.
No matter what they're doing, they can serve and you inspire us because of the
quality of your lives because of the wisdom and because of your dedication here.
My dad was fond of an old poem and I'll share it with you. An old man going alone highway
came at evening cold and gray to a chasm vast deep and wide, through which was flowing a sullen tide.
The old man crossed in the twilight. Damn, the sullen stream had no fear for him,
but he turned when safe on the other side and built a bridge to span the tide.
Oh, man, set a fellow pilgrim near, you're wasting your strength building here.
Your journey will end with the ending day, you'll never pass again this way.
You've crossed the chasm deep and wide.
Why are you building this bridge at evening tide?"
The builder lifted his old grey head, good friend in the path I've come, he said.
Their followeth after me today, a youth whose feet must pass this way.
This chasm which has been not to me, to the fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.
too must cross in the twilight, damn good friend, and building the bridge for him.
You know, your highest calling of service is more than planning budgets and passing laws
and building infrastructure.
You're building a spiritual infrastructure, a bridge that you can entice, inspire a new
generation of people to rise up and do the right thing and do it well just like you have.
be the kind of people that will serve. That bridge will take them across the
canyons of hopelessness and anger and truly help them dream of a stronger
better tomorrow and make it happen. As for me, I want my dream and passion back. I'm
listening. Who knows what God may call me to do to fulfill the dream at some
point, if not, I may be called to encourage and pave the path for others. With
a simple words, remember to say, speak word. Your servant is listening. Speak
Lord, your servant, your servants are listening. Amen. Will you battle with me as we pray?
Spirit of God, in a moment that honors us to be able to serve, we pray the most important
prayer of all, thy will be done. On earth as it is in heaven, through my life, as
through others, in the government of this community, of this state, of this
nation, of this world, and in it all will you plant the seed, speak the voice,
break the silence, and inspire others to come toward this and to see the
ability of the service and to follow the good examples that we set in your precious
name we offer our prayer. We join me for the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge
allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Chair recognizes representative Mac Jackson for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker.
Today I rise for a black history moment.
Willie Duckworth was born in Sandersville, Georgia.
He was working in a sawmill when he was drafted during World War II.
He was assigned to a provisional training center at Fort Sloker, New York.
As a young soldier at Fort Slocum in May 1944,
private ductwork noticed that his unit was dragging
a feet while marching.
To help them up, he began calling the chant
to help the man keep in step.
The chant was an instant hit on base.
The next year, the Army work were recording engineers
to make a V-disk, a special recording distributed
during World War II to aid morale.
It was known as the Duckworth chant on bass,
but it was recorded as sound off.
The original cadence had a lead chant and response.
Sound off, one, two, sound off, three, four.
With these words and others,
willily Duckworth, unknowingly,
cemented his plays in US military history.
Mr. Duckworth said the chant came from calling hogs back home.
Thank you.
I yield a well.
Chair recognizes for a morning order.
Chairman Bershitt.
Chairman Corbett.
Representative LeHood.

assistance have been very helpful in getting those to you. So we just want to thank you.
We want to thank about Austin Laos County for coming up today and next time you drive
to Florida, you'll probably drive right through and stop and buy something and say hello.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes representative Bennett for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I was born by the river in a little tent and just like that river, I've been running ever since.
It's been a long, long time running, and I know a change has come.
Oh, yes, it is.
If Dexter were here, I would have him sing that, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, members of the House and Mr. Speaker.
This morning, I rise for my Black History moment to recognize two of my own
sorority sisters who have earned honors of distinction and are living the
the change that Sam Cook sang about back in the 60s.
Now serving as the highest ranking female
in the House Minority Caucus,
having served as the Minority Whip,
and now as the longest serving African-American female
in the house today, I rise to recognize
Representative Carolyn Hugley
as one of my black history moment honorees.
It's been a long, long time coming, and I know my second change agent was inaugurated
on January 20th, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was born to immigrant parents, graduated
from our alma mater, Howard University.

Representative Karen Hughgley, Carolyn Hughgley, and our Vice President, Kamala Harris.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Lot for a morning order.
Good morning, colleagues.
This morning I rise to give thanks to the law enforcement officers throughout our state.
I know that many of us remember between May and November of last year, Atlanta had an increased need because of the protest that occurred.
Hold this for a minute, Representative.
I can't even hear you up here.
This house will be at order.
If you're busy and don't have time to listen, then please step out into the any room or the hallway.
Lady May proceed.
Mr. Speaker, I was giving just a reminder here that it was May through November of last
year that our law enforcement officers around the state of Georgia were called to come
to the state capital here and to help with protests, some which turned violent, including
the fact that we had the Molotov cocktails thrown into our own Georgia state patrol headquarters.
And so I rise to say thank you and that we recognize here the importance of the role
that they play throughout our state and protecting us.
I also, as a reminder, to some and to inform some of our new
members, it was in 2018 that Georgia passed one of our bills
that created the Office of Public Safety Support.
That office was a unanimous vote here in the House.
And that office is a peer-driven program to assist officers
with mental health, any mental health needs.
because of the role that they play in protecting
and sometimes they are not treated in the kindest of ways
and I know that there's an effect on that.
So there's a program here now in the state,
the Office of Public Safety Support,
it's a division of public safety,
it's available to all law enforcement
and all first responders in Georgia,
including our EMTs and our dispatchers
and our firefighters,
so that if they have a need,
they can call on the help of their peers
to help get them through these times of trouble.
So again, as our governor said in his state of the state,
he said, Georgia backs the blue.
And Georgia does back the blue,
and I'd like to thank all of our law enforcement officers
throughout the state of Georgia.
Chair recognizes representative Maynard for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker Rothsen, for the opportunity to take a moment to recognize survivors of gun violence.
This week is National Gun Violence Survivors Week, which is intended to raise awareness
for common sense gun safety measures that save lives.
An honor of Officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed senselessly at the State Capitol, is
lying in rest in the U.S. Rotunda this morning until his body is taken to Arlington National
Cemetery.
Senseless violence is not tolerated in Georgia or America.
I encourage each of you to visit the moments that survive digital storytelling website
where Americans across the country share details of their gun violence experiences.
The story shared are from those affected by gun violence through homicides, suicides,
domestic violence, and stalking crimes involving guns, unintentional shootings, and even the
threats of being harmed by a gun.
Survivors include caregivers for those wounded, those injured by guns, loved ones who lost
someone from gun suicide, or those that just witnessed gun violence, who may be affected
by a lifetime of post-traumatic stress, survivor-suffer emotional, medical, financial, and legal
hardship for themselves and their communities.
I encourage each of you to visit the Everytown for Gun Safety website, which is the largest
gun violence prevention organization in the country.
Their mission is to educate and help us make sound policies.
week increase awareness by doing a hashtag GV Survivors Week. Thank you
Speaker Austin.
