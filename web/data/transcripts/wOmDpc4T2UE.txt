TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for being here we'll call this meeting
to order members of the subcommittee if you will follow along we will move quickly.
We'll start in section 24 24 dot 1 dot 3 through 24 dot 1 dot 9 this is our ag ed adds.
start with a number of items here. Number 24.1.3, we are not reducing those funds. 24.1.4.
We're annualizing the salary increase that was given. As you will see, this will impact
about 600 staff for a total of $94,000. 24.1.5. This is a $100,000 ad for 84 employees to
to impact the per-member per month rate
on the health insurance increase.
24.1.6, $110,000 to fund 10 new ag ed programs,
which we do each year, 24.1.7 to add $100,000
for a young farmer position in Bibb County.
And then 24.1.8 and .9 are adding program specific staff
for a total of about $400,000 there.
You'll turn it over to 24.3.4 to add
half a million dollars for our STEM software,
via gamification program.
24.5.2 a quarter million dollars to increase our
support for communities and schools,
which I think this committee has been very diligent,
very focused on supporting over the past.
I do want to draw your attention to 24.6.4 this is a two and a half million dollar ad
To fund those PSAT and AP exams that that we have paid for
We seem tremendous growth in this as well as very high demand in in these two tests
And so this is something that we're going to focus on funding in the base
Moving forward, but we're talking about you know quite a few exams quite a few exams
If you'll flip over to 24.7 and curriculum development, you're going to see that we're
going to make a number of transfers here in just a few minutes throughout this document
as they relate to literacy and where we're putting those items.
So when I reference a number of transfers out, you will see them transferring in in a
few minutes.
24.9.9.4. This is a formula true up 24.12. The literacy coach initiative. So this is the first place where you'll see dollars there from a literacy standpoint. This continues our focus on those resub based literacy coaches in our K5 system. This is adding 116 coaches bring that total to 116 coaches that 18.5 million dollars that you'll see there.
24.3.7 is a formula true up 24.13.8 this continues Chairman Dickey our focus on
character education programming that we've seen great success across the
state with 24.13.9 is a formula true up 24.13.10 again this is a transfer as it
relates the universal reading screener which you'll see coming back in just a
few minutes. 24, 13, 11, this $150,000 ad for our feminine hygiene grants due to our inflation
and increase in enrollments in those economically disadvantaged for those economically disadvantaged
students and grades five through 12. Last year we passed Senate Bill 464, which called
for a $15 million infusion of cash to provide,
stipend the $100 supply amount,
stipend to each teacher.
So we're funding $7.5 million, our half there.
2414.3 continued focus of this house
and this committee as school nutrition,
we're simply adding hold harmless language there
to continue and maintain the current funding.
We know that while the number of students
needing those meals may have gone down.
Anybody has bought eggs lately or anything else for that matter.
You know the rising cost of meals has offset that.
24.16.2.
We have a new federal bus driver training requirement and mandate.
And this is the first year cost.
Here if you'll see the $158,000 to pay for that for about 20,000 users across the state.
that cost will be cut in half next year.
We'll move quickly through a whole bunch of formula true ups.
Here we go, 24-17-1, 24-18-1, 24-19-2, 24-19-3, 24-19-4,
all formula true ups where you see different amounts.
We'll continue with 24.20.3.
And then 24-22, our school nurses, this is that same calculation
in comment that I made just a minute ago about school nutrition. We have a
whole harmless language there, even though there is a decline in elementary
school enrollment. 24.23.2, we're adding $150,000. This is an agency request to
fund a position to oversee all of those school safety dollars, those safety
grants, that $109 million that's in the budget plus the infusion that the
governor provided additional $50 million. That person who was overseeing that
funding was paid through a federal grant. Since that grant's ending we want to
make sure we have a dedicated person who can oversee a whole lot of a whole lot
of dollars to make sure they go where they're supposed to. 24.23.3 this is a
$25 million ad to focus on school safety. These are the start-up funds for the
first year of the database ongoing funds for the BTAM teams, we've all voted on that bill
and we know where those priorities are. 24.24.1, this is a $715,000 adjustment based on
the governor's recommendation. This is going by the House Bill 318 that was about charter
school commission compliance last year but specifically these new positions are to provide
support to schools that are trying to become locally approved charter schools 24
24 4 is a formula true up you'll go with me to 24.26 our student support
services these these are some pretty major investments that we as a
committee and and we as a house are making here to further support our
students the first 20 million dollar ad targets 20 thousand dollars per
middle and per high school for 979 schools across the state to provide them
with a mental health provider whether that's their telehealth hiring in
school staff really concentrating on continuing our focus on mental health.
24-26-2 to find an additional $5 million for social workers this is to target
those 75 schools that have no form of social workers so that we can put
someone there, give them access, give those students access to much needed resources 24-26-3.
This is our, if any of you are familiar with the concept, the boost and the boost program
and the reference to boost 2.0, this is a $10 million ad to continue to support our out
of school and after school as I would say initiatives and then lastly in that same section
24.26.4, 28 million dollar ad to create a poverty weight inside our QBE formula, we can talk
offline about who is eligible and how that can be calculated. 24.27.1 is a formula true
up. If you've been around the last couple of years, 24.27.6 will make a lot of sense
to you where we've worked on those heavy equipment simulators. We've seen great success
across the state side note if y'all haven't been in one of those heavy equipment
simulators please contact me let me show you how to get in touch with those
guys and go sit one of those simulators and see what we're teaching high school
kids how to do it's it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing you've never
moved dirt and filled up a dump truck this this is something you need to partake
in for sure very happy to to support that 24.27.7 is just annualizing that
raise. We have a new as as for leader Gamble knows and has been a great advocate for our Georgia
Center for Civic engagement. They finally became a career and tech student organization and so on
24.27.8 program I'm very proud to support and they overseer youth assembly if anybody's been
here for that so we're adding $100,000 to that we will flip over to almost done 25.4.2 and ERS
we're simply adding $23 million to what's already in the base for a total of
$50 million so that we can add an increase our one-time payment to our retirees
and let's wrap up with our literacy initiatives. I guess we've got one quick
item before we get there. 27.10.3. Y'all are our PSE and our ethics
investigators are handling 20,000 cases a year. They've gone the last nine years without
having additional headcount staff, but that workload has increased 210%. So we're adding
two full-time investigators for the 222,000 you see there. Another literacy transfer there,
but lastly, if you'll pull over to 27.14 in Gosa, you will see where we begin to add more
dollars here for literacy for our coaches for our universal reading screener if you'll
see on 2714.3 this this coincidentally you know we did the blind I call it the blind tasting
of the screeners that were available and this is the one that was chosen it's actually the lowest
cost screener so great to know that it's the best and and the lowest cost 27.14.14 quarter
million dollar ad for that literacy coach coordinator position and then we really want
in 27.14.5 want to supplement what we're doing from a literacy standpoint with those
competency-based research-based facts and figures and so you will see that there.
That's all I have or there are any questions from the committee here none wants a little
committee. We have a motion to second any further discussion. You're going on all those
in favor, please say aye. Any opposed, like, sign? Thank you. We stand adjourned.
