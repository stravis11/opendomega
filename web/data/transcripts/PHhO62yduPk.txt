TRANSCRIPT
----------
I want to thank everybody for coming as we attempt to bring your attention to the
actions regarding the First Amendment by President Trump and a lack of action
quite frankly of our Senate Republican colleagues and the blatant effort to
destroy freedom of speech in this nation. Although the FCC attack on Jimmy
Kimmel has brought to light many of these efforts in a more mainstream manner,
we have to kind of put these efforts into its proper contacts. It actually
It started when the administration reopened complaints against major networks involving
the 2024 and 2020 election.
But the former FCC heads who actually dismissed those complaints said that this was an opportunity
unfortunately to weaponize the FCC against the First Amendment.
And that's why she dismissed them.
But that's exactly why they were re-broad open as to use the FCC as a weaponization project
against the First Amendment.
But it continued when President Trump actually brought suits against law firms, actually told
law firms that they would be punished for who they actually had been suing or what causes
they had actually undertaken.
It actually continued, of course, with the defunding of the corporate corporation for public
broadcasting.
It also continued, but the fact that we now basically cannot discuss one of America's
original sense, slavery within the United States.
We continue, of course, when we have students who have been picked up and imprisoned for
nothing more than exercising their freedom of speech.
All of these things have been built up to what we came with far as Jimmy Kimmel's concern.
So although that is the mainstream kind of thing that took place as far as bringing President
Trump's assault on First Amendment really to the forefront for many Americans, this assault
has been going on fully and forthrightly since he has been re-elected.
So the Senate Democratic Caucus, partners with groups around the state, around the nation
quite frankly, to stand against this blatant tyrannical power grab by the administration,
and stand also against the silence and capitulation by the Republican Party in general, but specifically
by the state Republican Party of Georgia.
And with this understanding of solidarity, and we're now turning the microphone over
to Asuka Mahmoud, who will also discuss these particular issues.
It's Mahmoud.
Good morning.
Good morning.
My name is Asuka Mahmoud and I represent the Georgia Chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations.
Since assuming office in January 2025, President Trump and his admin have launched a dangerous and unprecedented attack
on our right to free speech.
And in just the past nine months, we have seen a dramatic increase in viewpoint discrimination,
media censorship, and attacks on groups and individuals that the U.S. government disagrees
with.
In March 2025, two activists that spoke out against the Palestinian genocide were abducted
by unidentified ICE officers under the Trump admins' directives.
While Mahmoud Khalil and Rumezao's torque have since been released, several other anti-genocide
activists and other activists and immigrants remain detained simply because of their
stances on Palestine or immigration status.
This is a glaring example of the Trump Admin's wide-ranging attacks on free speech and clear
viewpoint discrimination.
The arrests of these activists are one link in the chain of suppression of society wide
free speech.
The Trump Admin has barred media outlets from the White House, handed over social media
channels to favored owners, so information can be manipulated, forced media personalities
off air for their views, weaponized our immigration system to target dissent, and threatened
to use the IRS to shut down organizations that strengthen our communities.
As an American Muslim, I remind Americans that minority groups are the canary in the
coal mine, that our collective silence when Palestine activists were being targeted is
what led us to this moment and we can protect free speech for all Americans only if we stick
to our values and protect the right to free speech for all Americans and causes.
I hope that my words today are not just seen as an alarm bell for the growing fascism
this admin is ushering in but also as a call to action for all of us to stand together
and protect each other in our neighbors so that history remembers us as united against
repression and fascism and not divided
along political lines.
Thank you.
Good morning, everybody.
My name is Josh McLaren.
I serve in the state Senate and proud to stand
with Senate Democrats today to talk about
the importance of protecting free speech in this country.
My colleagues have ably summed up the main situation,
but I want to be very clear about contrast.
you're probably gonna hear from the administration
or the GOP that, well, government censorship
happened under Biden, or they'll claim
that both sides are doing this.
Let's be very clear about the contrast
between what we've seen over the last few years
and what we're seeing now.
In the last few years, there were a couple incidents,
this discussion of cancel culture,
where people brought their dollars
or voted with their feet to support entities
and businesses that align with their values.
When the private sector engages in free speech
or disassociation based on values,
that's not government repression.
When voters and consumers make choices
about who they want to support,
that's not government repression.
Neither was when the Biden administration
simply requested or asked social media companies
to take down COVID misinformation
in the pursuit of the public good.
You'll hear conservatives cite to that example
as all the other side did repression as well.
Those were requests.
They were voluntary requests
that the Biden administration did.
And contrast that with what we're seeing now.
Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC,
went on a podcast the Wednesday after the Monday
when Jimmy Kimmel first made remarks.
And on that podcast on a Wednesday,
Brendan Carr said, we can either do this the easy way
or we can do this the hard way.
And basically said explicitly that the ABC affiliates
under his regulation needed to take, quote, action on Kimmel.
He said his name.
Within hours of that podcast, that Wednesday,
next star and other ABC affiliates
had refused to air Kimmel, and then ABC globally
followed suit by suspending him for some period of time.
Now we've seen that ABC has reversed
the Kimmel suspension at the top level.
That's tremendous news for democracy.
Jimmy Kimmel got record ratings in the millions
when he made his speech, defending free speech,
and he got those ratings even though
a large number of affiliates had continued to cancel
his show and i think that just goes to show
the american people
value free speech
the american people want
voices like him all to be able to keep speaking out even if not everybody
agrees
with every word that jimmy kimmel says
and i'm tremendously
uh... given optimism by this i have a lot of optimism uh... that i take from this
because
what it means is at the end of the day we still have a robust culture free speech
in this country
americans are not going to take
this repression by the Trump administration lying down.
And we here at the Senate Democrats and our allies here
in Georgia, we stand with all protectors and defenders
of free speech, and we will do everything
in our power at the state government level
to ensure that people still have the right
to speak, to express themselves, and to be heard.
What is really troubling to echo our leaders' comments
is that Senate Republicans have continued to fall in line
behind Donald Trump and all of his authoritarian whims.
And it's telling that even people like Brendan Carr,
just a few years ago, were espousing the importance
of free speech before now turning their backs on it
and following the whims of Donald Trump wherever he may go.
So we hope, but we haven't seen much evidence of it yet,
that Senate Republicans here in Georgia will stand up,
will show some courage during one of the darkest moments
for free speech in this country's history
and stand up to the authoritarian influences of Trump.
But we're not going to hold our breath
because thus far, through their legislation
and through their actions and words,
the Senate Republicans have continued to tow the line
to try to be as mega as possible
and do whatever it is that Trump wants
based on his ego.
Thank you for your time.
Good morning.
I'm Nan Orock, a member of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
I represent the households in Senate District 36 across Atlanta in the Tri-Cities area around
the airport.
I'm happy to raise my voice alongside my fellow speakers here standing up for free speech
and headlining the fact that we hear silence from Republicans on this question, silence
here under the gold dome, silence across our city and state, and silence in the highest
reaches of federal government in Washington, our congressional delegation from Georgia,
the GOP congressional delegation standing silent in the wake of this odious attack on free
speech that we as a nation have witnessed.
And I will say to you following the remarks that have already been delivered that a whole
new section of Americans woke up this week when they realized, wait a minute, that guy
in the White House is going to say who I can watch on TV,
and what committee I can tune in for late night humor
before I go to bed.
And that's why you saw across this country
a whole new level of pushback against this administration
and against this effort to stifle free speech.
We're going to see more of that as more Americans take note.
Oh, this is going to impact my life, my day-to-day activities,
and who I care to listen to, and who I care to life at,
and who I care to vote for.
That, to me, is a lesson that's going to play out.
And we will all stand witness to it
as the movement against the repressive Trump regime,
which is absolutely taking the fascist pathway.
The resistance to that is growing by the hour.
Thank you so much.
Good afternoon, everybody.
My name is Bentley Huggins.
I use they-them pronouns
and I'm the Georgia State Director
of the Human Rights Campaign.
We are the country's largest LGBTQ plus civil rights organization.
Today, I join you with my colleagues to stand in full support of the First Amendment
and in full support of free speech.
Right now, LGBTQ plus people across the country, especially trans people, are under attack.
our lives, our families, our friends, our communities,
our being threatened just because of who we are,
just because of what we say,
and just because of how we wanna live.
People across the country see us in a lot of different ways.
But what I want you to know is that we are your friends,
we are neighbors, we're people with families, we have pets,
We have community gardens, we work in restaurants,
we live down the street from you,
we're just like everybody else.
And the decision to cancel Jimmy Kimmel's show
and bring it back is frightening.
The fact that the president feels like he can silence
or censor someone just because he doesn't like
how they report on what he says,
or the fact that he feels like he can control
what is a pinnacle of the American society, free speech.
That should wake up everyone.
That should shock your conscience
and to believing that we are in the reality that we sit in.
That free speech is under attack.
That everyday people are being used as scapegoats
rather than being seen as the human beings for who we are.
So I thank you for coming today
and I beg you to please support queer people,
support LGBTQ plus Georgians and support free speech.
Thank you.
Thank you so much and with that we'll be glad to open up for any questions.
And let me also bring one thing to everyone's attention, this is a reminder.
We actually do have a free speech bill, an anti-free speech bill that exists right now.
That's of course the DEI bill that's pending in the House to pass the Senate that says
colleges can lose funding if they basically have solidarity towards certain groups.
And we already know that Republicans have already stated that they are against speech.
Let's don't forget that.
Remember we battled that bill all night almost in the state Senate and Republicans voted
for that bill.
It is now sitting in the Georgia House as far as colleges could actually lose funding
as far as DEI's concern.
So we already know kind of like we're Republican stand on the issue of free speech.
And so I did want to kind of bring that out to everyone's attention as a reminder that
that bill is sitting there.
So when we start talking about what position that we're going to have in Georgia as far as
free speech is concerned that bill needs to be defeated and so that's actually
now in the Republican led House of Representatives we'll see what they do
with it we know how Democrats stand we voted against it we know how
Republicans in the Senate stood they voted for it was now found out how
Republicans in the House stand for free speech without open up for any
questions but I know you do have one off topic which is perfectly fine
The fact that the pathways has been extended, we have a, what we've been describing so far
with how many months now we are into this administration, failed administration, supporting
the failed policy quite frankly.
That's basically the way you should look at it.
has become woefully and adequately improved and be woefully
and adequately as far as ensuring Georgia's.
We still have over 400,000 Georgians
that would not be insured because we refuse
to do Medicaid expansion.
To what we're basically looking at, as I said,
failed president supporting and failed policy.
So it's no real surprise there to continue promoting
these particular policies that will not work for Georgia's.
And so on one level, we were glad that a few people
that get coverage through that is great,
but on this more substantive level, quite frankly,
it is woefully and adequate.
We've been saying that for years,
and I will repeat that again.
Fail presidency actually represented a failed policy.
Yeah, what happened?
Absolutely, yeah.
I'll just add briefly, there was recent reporting
that the pathways program is costing more
in administrative costs than the actual amount of dollars
that is being doled out for care.
So when you look at the historic cost ratios of programs
like the Social Security Administration, for example,
historically, gives out its benefits
for less than a dollar overhead out of 100 bucks.
This is a woeful comparison where you have even more on overhead than the actual cost
of care itself.
I mean, that's a totally remarkable stat that everybody should hear about.
And I think that it's telling that these are not unconnected conversations.
I'm going to make the argument that's not off topic because a lot of the drama that's
happening at the federal level with this, these attacks on free speech, these culture
wars, we just, there's breaking news that the DOJ is now pushing to investigate the
Soros Foundation, which essentially is taking orders from Trump and Vance, who have identified
Soros and Ford as enemies.
That type of culture war is meant to distract from policy failures.
It sounds like a talking point, but truly think about the air time that gets sucked up
on these culture wars and these attacks on basic constitutional rights.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Georgians don't have health care, and the lackluster
program that Brian Kemp has put together and swore to everybody would be just as good
as Medicaid expansion is spending more on overhead than on people.
So I beg to differ, I appreciate the respect of saying off topic, but these are all one
conversation, which is that we have failures in government at the state and federal level
that would be authoritarian leaders are trying to cover over with shock and awe to attack
their political enemies.
with that. Any other further questions? Absolutely. Come forward.
Thank you, Leader Jones. Let us not forget that on the federal level, as we speak,
Obamacare covered 20 million additional people with health insurance and access to health care.
Extending that beyond its present time has been canceled out with the GOP in Congress
in the House blocking that money.
So we will see devastation, devastation on every side to our health care systems across
across the country and to the health of our folks here in Georgia and around the country.
And two hospitals announced down in Evans, Georgia and up in North Georgia, teetering on
the brink will not be able to survive the cuts that are coming from the GOP's federal
action.
All of this run at flowing downhill from a Trump administration that is showing us loud
and clear, anti-free speech, anti-health care, anti-hospitals, and the list goes on.
So America was waking up, Georgia is waking up.
And with that I want to thank everyone for coming out.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
