----------
All members will report to their assigned seats in the House of Representatives. All members will report to their seats. All members will gather in. We're going to have the morning roll call here in a moment. All right, we're going to have the morning roll call. All members present. We'll please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Thank you. Have all members voted? Got a little low turnout today. I'm assuming though that they're all those that are not here are downstairs being tested. What do you think? Good time to remind you that testing will continue until 11 a.m. downstairs. If you have not tested, then now's the time to do that. All members voted. What you wish to speak representative Thomas during the roll call? All right, all members have voted. The clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will close the doors and keep them closed. Well, good morning. We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance. To the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 27th House District, Chairman Lee Hawkins. Chairman Hawkins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I have the pleasure of reintroducing Scott Hurne to you. Scott visited with us last year in January. Scott is, I think, one of the best ministers I've ever heard. I'm sincere about that. He brings a positive message and each Sunday when we go to church, always felt better leaving than I did getting there. He reminds me a lot of you. He represents the people that he serves. He represents his Lord. And he does it in a positive way. He focuses on solutions rather than on the problems. And he's a leader in the church and a leader in the community. And like many of you, he faces really tough times and tough decisions and finds a way that we all come together at the end. It's not the chicken or the egg but more is it Kentucky fried or bow jungles. So he gets to the point quickly. He is no longer in Gainesville. He is now in Augusta. But I ask Scott to come up here as my minister because he will always be my minister. Scott Hurne. Speaker Rausten and representative and friend, Lee Hawkins and distinguished members of this body. Thank you so much for this high honor. And I just want to make sure that representative Hawkins' words just then didn't come out of my time. Hey, listen, I want to say also this. Just as a lifelong resident of this great state, I really appreciate that people like me get to come and stand at this place. That means something to me and I want to thank you for that. So what I want to share this morning is an observation that I don't think I'm the only one that shares it. And that is this. That God has slowly being removed from our national and political dialogue. And my fear also is what also is at risk is the protection of faith convictions also being removed. Now this hasn't always been the case in a moment. I want to share a powerful example of when God was placed front and center by a sitting president and it really wasn't that long ago. So why is God at risk of being removed? I mean, is God be as offensive or judgmental or not fair because we've gotten so smart? I think it's something else. And I think we begin to find that in the Proverbs writer who writes in Proverbs 30, 89, keep falsehoods and lie far from me. Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you God and say, who is the Lord? And I think that's where we as a nation are saying today, where is the Lord? And I don't think it's because we're so smarter, we're trying to be so politically correct. I think it's because we have become so affluent. Affluent and humility don't complement each other. And the more affluent we become, the less dependent we become. And the less dependent as a nation, the more arrogant. I mean, isn't it ironic that we have moved away from the God who has blessed us so much because he's blessed us so much? So in Deuteronomy chapter 8, Moses has led this crazy group of wild people for 40 years across the wilderness and they finally come to the Jordan River. And he's about to release them into the control and authority and responsibility of Joshua, but he says this, he has a little speech before he steps away and he says this in verse 6, observe the commands of the Lord your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him. So two things that we read in this is law and reverence and awe. And when you read the founding fathers of this country, there is no mention of a king. There are two things, law and remaining in awe of God. Verse 10, when you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you. And so Moses is saying, listen, be grateful. Be grateful. Moses knew us in our human nature that we are so prone to move very quickly to my hands, did this. And Moses knew that prosperity and humility don't go together. And it's not just individuals, it's nations also. You lose your humility, you lose your dependence and you end up asking who is the Lord. Verse 12, 11, be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied and when you build find houses and settle down and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied, then your heart will become proud. And you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, for 17, you may say to yourself, my power and the strength of my hands has produced this wealth for me. And when you think about, and when you think that what we have done is we've done our own that we're no longer accountable to anyone else. And when we lose a sense of accountability, we become more unjust in our treatment of other people. And when we think that what we have is because of our hard work, we think it is all ours. And justice is out the window. Verse 18, but remember the Lord your God for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth and so confirms his covenant which he sworked here ancestors as it is today. If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship them about down to them, I testify against you this day that you will surely be destroyed. Like the nations the Lord destroyed before you so you will be destroyed for not obeying the Lord your God. Now just God destroyed the nations I'm not here to talk about that but here's something I think we all would agree on. But I know this and you know this arrogance, lack of humility and pride carry a judgment all their own. Leave God out of that. It hasn't always been that way. We knew we knew that we were going to be entering into World War II as a country. We didn't know when but we knew it was going to happen. And on June the 6th, 1944 Franklin Delar is about. Address the whole nation via radio. With a prayer. It's not that long ago. Almighty God our sons pride of our nations this day have set upon a mighty endeavor a struggle to preserve our Republic our religion and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity lead them straight and true give strength to their arms, stateness to their hearts, steadfast to their faith. They will need thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. Success may not come with rushing speed but we shall return again and again. And we know that by thy grace and by the righteousness of our cause our sons will triumph. For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace they fight not for the lust of conquest they fight to end conquest they fight to liberate they fight to let justice arise intolerance and good will. Among all thy people they yearn but for the end of the battle for their return to their haven of home some will never return embrace these father and receive them. And that's for us at home fathers, mothers, children's wives, sisters and brothers of brave men overseas who's thoughts and prayers are ever with them help us. Oh, my God to rededicate ourselves and renewed faith to thee in this hour of great sacrifice. Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single day of special prayer but because the road is long and the desire is great I ask that our people devote themselves in a continuance of prayer. As we rise each day and again as when each day is spent let words of prayer be on our lips invoking thy help to our efforts and oh Lord give us faith give us faith in thee faith in our sons and faith in each other thy will be done almighty God. Amen. You see we still do this that even with all of the development of our military not my we still need a God and we work too prideful to ask for it and now was there push back to this boy you better believe it but it was ignored. Listen the civil rights movement was led by a preacher. Aren't you glad someone ago hey hey wait wait wait wait we can't talk about God in connection with politics aren't you glad. We can afford to let God disappear from our national conversation because we will become accountable only to ourselves and when we are accountable only to ourselves we will become even more unjust. And to do so will cause our national conscience to erode even more and with it our sense of ought and ought not and we will have no one to be grateful to the most sensible thing to do is to keep God at the center of our national conversation and the beautiful thing about this country is is those who don't believe are free not to believe. What it be powerful. Well political official in the speech that yes they said God bless America but then they added this heartfelt plea to God to make America grateful than everyone would know that we really still are a nation under God and we are accountable. To God and we are grateful to God and that there is no doubt in our minds that we are who we are because of his grace. Lord we give thanks for all your many blessings pray blessings on this sustained body that you might continue to God and lead us and be our God and lead us gracefully and faithfully in Jesus name. Amen. And I would like to join me in the pledge. A pledge allegiance to the flag of United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. You You You Chair recognizes chairman Hogan the chair of the committee on information and audits.

Now led by new director Tim Lairmore, they're doing continue to do a great job.

There are 119 local forest units throughout this state, and they're down here quite often as you see the resolution on the board, down here celebrating with us the great work they do. We all know the importance for preventing forest fires in our state's forest and for the people of our state. Georgia Forest Commission does a wonderful job educating Georgians on the dangers of forest fires and how to prevent those dreadful calamities. Georgia is the number one state in the nation for forestry. Thanks to a healthy markets for our forestry, including paper, lumber, and over 5,000 life-sustaining products.

And Georgia College is one of the only six military colleges in the United States of nation. We should be all very proud of our University of System of Georgia. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Anola Witts for a morning order. Representative Anola Witts has been recognized for a morning order and her time is running. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is Junior League of Atlanta Day at the Capitol, like many other days that we've mentioned. It is being done virtually, but it is a very important day that Junior League was founded in 1916. There are Junior League's actually throughout the state of Georgia, and you hang around this place long enough. They're going to find you, and they will want you to support some legislation. So I urge you to call them back when they call you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Burnow for a morning order. Chair recognizes Representative Frazier for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is Sickle Cell Day at your State Capitol. I wanted to take a moment to ask you to join me in celebrating and commemorating our 50th year anniversary for the Sickle Cell Foundation for the State of Georgia. As many of you will know, I have been down here 15 years, and normally when I come to the well, it is usually about Sickle Cell. I would just like to thank my friends that are gathered here today with especially Representative Al Williams, Chairman Butch Perry, and Representative Carolyn Hugley, who have stood with me throughout this fight, and also to recognize Senator Lester Jackson, former State Senator Renee Oldman, and Senator Tanya Anderson, who fights for Sickle Cell in the Senate. We are here today to celebrate 50 years commemorating Sickle Cell Day at the Georgia State Capitol. 50 years, you need to understand, we have Sickle Cell patients that does not even live 50 years. The average age for a man is 42. The average age for a woman with Sickle Cell is 48. Many of you have passed that age right here, so we work very, very hard to ensure that we are coming to the state that we are continuing the fight to find a cure for Sickle Cell. So please join me today virtually from 2 to 4. The Zoom information is on your desk, and you have Sickle Cell people that are online right now, at Sickle Cell Foundation, at Chairman, Dale McClary is online with the Board of Directors and hundreds of Sickle Cell constituents throughout the state. So join me from 2 to 4 to hear the stories and to tell them how grateful you are as we celebrate 50 years the Sickle Cell Foundation. Thank you. Recognize this representative Maynard for a morning order? Thank you, Speaker. Last night, we lost a large community leader by the name of Haroon Waikiel. Haroon Waikiel was one of the founders of the street groomers. The street groomers, they advocated for the homeless. All day today, all last night, I have received calls from City Council leaders in Atlanta, state leaders. He has been here, actually, so many times protesting against people here at the Capitol, but at the end of the day, whether you're Republican, whether you're a Democrat, whatever your socioeconomic background is, he just wanted to fight for what was right. He's a very young man. He suffered from seizures. We're not sure what the cause of death is, but all day this morning, W-A-OK radio, people have been pouring in just saying how much they cared about him, WSB TV last night. So, let's please take a moment of silence for a giant that we lost last night, Mr. Haroon Waikiel. Thank you, Speaker. Morning, Order Time has expired. We're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 442. House Bill 442, the columns of the 68th B. Title IX, Title 19, the fiscal to Georgia, annotated, relating domestic relations, so as to provide for the management of social media in parenting plans, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Juvenile Justice, that Committee recommends the disbilled Dupasse. Chair recognizes the chairman of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee, Chairman Collins, to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring before you House Bill 442, it's a very simple bill dealing with domestic relations, specifically with parenting plans for children of parents who are going through a divorce. Currently in statute, a judge will award the oversight of four categories to warner both parents, the child's education, the child's health, the child's extracurricular activities, and the child's religious upbringing. I stand before you today because, like so many others, we see where young children are having cell phones and social media. This just simply adds the management of social media to our current statute, as we have evolved as a society, as a state. That's one of the issues that I think a lot of parents are dealing with, and this just makes it very clear and allows the judge and the parents to go through mediation and decide on who oversees the management of social media. Very simple bill, I'd ask for your favorable consideration. And if there's no questions, I'd like to yield the oil, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 442? Or vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? What purpose does the majority leader rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, I'd like for it to be recorded in the record that the gentleman, the chairman that just presented the bill, has done it the proper way. This is the first bill he has presented to this body in five years since he's been here. I think he was ready. I think he nailed it, sir. Congratulations to Chairman Collins. Thank you. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 442. The eyes are 154. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 63. House Bill 63, members. In black one in the 146 to be entitled next to amend chapter 5c of 40, Title 4080, the fish go to Georgia, and it's either relating to alternative ad, ballarm tax on motor vehicles. This bill having referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. There recognizes the chair of the Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Blackman to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're bringing before you House Bill 63. As many of you know, when we changed the title tax laws in our state, TABT, did double tax and impact our leases in a kind of a destructive way. When we fixed that, we did not exclude the fees and interest that go along with leases as the payments come in. This addresses that and fixes that moving forward. I've been working on it for a few years. Certainly appreciate all the sponsors and the work that's gone into it from the interested parties. And DOR, as you noticed, it asked us for an effective date of January 1st. So in section 2, you'll see that. I think really it's a consumer friendly piece and it reaffirms our commitment to the duty that lies near Mr. Speaker. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. I'd be happy to. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark up in the gallery to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it generally yield? Yes, ma'am. So based on this bill, does that mean that the fair market value of my vehicle is going to go up or go down after this, if this laws pass? There won't be any change to the fair market value of your vehicle. This simply impacts what is taxed on a lease for month to month. That's why we're going to have a question about the fair market value of your vehicle. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Clark. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favourable consideration. You'll be well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 63. The eyes are 166. The nays are zero. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 43. House Bill 43, by rep. Cantrell, the 22nd and others to be entitled, an act to amend Code Section 42, 26th of the fiscal to Georgia and Teta, ruling the form and contents of application for registration, heavy vehicle tax and satisfactory proof of insurance. This bill haven't referred to the committee on motor vehicles. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Cantrell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring to you today House Bill 43. It's a very simple bill. This bill was carried by Chairman McCall last year. And I co-sponsored it with him, then it died with COVID. And so I'm bringing it back today. What this bill does is very simple. It allows a car owner when they're registering their license plate. It gives them the option. It's at their option. It's not mandated. It's not an information if the driver of the vehicle might have a physical, mental or neurological condition, which might impede their ability to communicate with a law enforcement officer if they were to get pulled over. So basically what it would do is if the driver got pulled over, the officer would scan the tag and they'd be able to see, I might be talking to a person who has a communication challenge of some kind. Hopefully we can cut down on some of the miscommunications we've had between law enforcement and drivers of vehicles. The second thing that it does is it provides an alternative emergency number. So if the officer wants further clarification, they can call this number to find out exactly what condition the driver has at their bout to encounter. And that's the bill as a whole. That's all it does. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to yield the well because I know Chairman Nicks would like to speak to this bill. You had no questions and the chair recognizes Chairman Nicks to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be real brief. If you think this is not a big deal, I have a lady by the name of Serenity Graham and Lagrange. I'd like you to talk to. She called me last fall and was describing this bill and what she would like to see in it. She is the mother of a son who is about to turn 16, who is a diabetic. His name is Walker. Hits the name of this bill is Walker's Law. She was very concerned that he might be stopped. Be having some type of episode, not that would keep him from driving, but would keep him from communicating with the officer. She asked me to carry this bill and get this bill. I didn't think it was a big deal, but after talking to her for a while, I found out it was. I talked to Chairman Corbett. He told me that this bill had been there before. I actually drew a bill up. Then I found out that Representative Cantrell had already done this bill and we just added Walker's Law to it. I think it's great. It comes in handy to protect both the individual who may have the problem. I think it also helps protect our law enforcement. We've had so many situations where a traffic stop turned into a very serious situation. I think this will help alleviate some of that. Please join me in passing House Bill 43, which we're going to call Walker's Law in honor of this young man from Lagrange. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The Chair hears none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. The members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 43. The eyes are 169. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 86. I'm sorry, Mr. Spoke. House Bill 218. House Bill 218, members, and a balance of the 23rd to be entitled to an act to men code section 1611126, the fiscal of Georgia, and the committee are related to having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons. This bill having for the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security that the Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Ballinger to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring before you a very simple little housekeeping gun bill. The first bill would allow our Attorney General to enter into agreements with other states. This would allow permit carriers, permit holders here in the state of Georgia to carry out.

and approximately five other states as well as have those carriers come here and enjoy our wonderful state while they're enjoying their second amendment rights as well. The section two has to do with the powers of the governor and how they're related during an emergency order and it just puts some constraints and keeps from infringing on our second amendment rights. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I'll be more than happy to take any questions. You have a question if you care to yield. Oh yield. Chair recognizes representative Dunahoo to your right for a question. How are you doing today? I'm very well representative Dunahoo. How are you? I'm great. This is a friendly question. Could you just explain line 55 where it says pursuant to declared state of emergency shall through 60. I've been asked a question on that and I think I understand it pretty well, but if you could just explain the definition of that. Thank you. Okay. What is so I do apologize. Can you restate the question because I got it because you said the following lines. I'm not sure if it was over the specific word or the statement or the statement of 55 through 62 line. 55 through 62. Thank you. Okay. So color of law while acting during our pursuant to a declared state of emergency shall seize or authorize the seizure of any firearm ammunition or any component thereof ammunition relating equipment supplies or weapons. The possession of which was not prohibited by law at the time immediately prior to the declaration of the state of emergency and other than as provided by the criminal or for which are laws the state prohibit possession of any firearm. This is going into the emergency powers that the governor has and putting constraints on those powers so that he can in French upon our second and a member rights even during a declared state of emergency. Made me put my glasses back on. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. To recognize his representative Becky Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise in opposition to House Bill 2018. House Bill 2018 unnecessarily expands Georgia's concealed Gary Hengen reciprocity. This bill would allow people who have concealed gun permits from any other states to also carry their handguns here in Georgia. We do not need to expand concealed carry reciprocity in Georgia. Currently our law allows those who are licensed to carry in other states to also carry in Georgia only if the Georgia handgun carry license is also recognized in their resident state. Chairman Baliger told me that's called specific reciprocity. When we talked in committee about who we have specific reciprocity for we there they were unsure but I looked it up on the attorney general website. We have concealed care reciprocity with 32 states and the two states that were mentioned in committee are already on our list and for the record these are the states Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. So we have we have that reciprocity there. So the Chairman Baliger also made a point that this bill does not automatically provide reciprocity. It facilitates the process. It allows the attorney general to enter into an agreement that allows permit holders in those states to carry their allows our permit holders to carry here. I'm going to carry there. However, the language of this bill does not require reciprocity which the current law does. So I oppose this bill for several reasons. It's a dangerous threat to our law enforcement officers and our public safety. There's no assurance of discretionary provisions and no assurance of safety and no flexibility for judges during a state of emergency. This general expansion of carry reciprocity could force Georgia to recognize the concealed carry standards from the remaining 17 states where we don't have reciprocity, even the five that have dramatically weaker standards and those that don't require any permit at all. Law enforcement overwhelmingly opposes concealed carry reciprocity which would put police in danger for doing their jobs. On April 19, 2018, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, IACP, released a letter of opposition to the Federal Conceal Carry Reciprocity Act. This letter was signed by 473 law enforcement agencies from 39 states who joined together to oppose concealed carry reciprocity. Our own Lagrange Georgia Chief of Police, Lewis M. Deckmar, was IACP President at that time. And this is what he said. While I support Second Amendment rights for all law-biting citizens, I strongly oppose the concealed carry reciprocity act because it endangers the public and law enforcement. This legislation would override state laws that determine who is qualified to carry a concealed firearm, laws that take into account the distinctive circumstances and needs in each state. No state should be forced to accept a person carrying a concealed that does not meet the standards of the state of set for its own citizens. Conceal carry reciprocity severely interferes with local law enforcement's ability to prevent gun violence and safeguard the public. I reached out to my law enforcement officers late last night in researching this bill and I heard back from our sheriff and Deckab and from Michael O'Connor, the Deputy Chief of Police. This is not an official police position, but Michael O'Connor said, while I consider myself to be a supporter of Second Amendment rights in general, I am not a supporter of this bill as written. That is my personal opinion. My professional opinion is that this bill has nothing to increase the personal safety of Georgians. It might very well contribute to a spike in gun violence as seen throughout the state in 2020. I ask you, my esteemed colleagues, what does your law enforcement think about this bill? Do they support or do they oppose? It's hard to know if you wouldn't be able to have sent them the bill because it was changed twice, changed in committee with a sub, changed in rules with a sub. So you wouldn't have been able to send them the exact will to ask them that. So I ask that you check in with your law enforcement officers before you vote yes on this bill. Now we all know that police officers cannot stop and ask to see a permit for no reason. But if they are probable cause and that person has a weapon, Georgia police officers face an impossible task to verify if the out-of-state permit is valid, meaning that this job will make their job, excuse me, making this bill will make their job more difficult as they are unable to confirm if that person showing a concealed carry permit is a law abiding gun hunter. As Boston Commissioner William Evans said in April 2018 during traffic stops and other interactions with the public, our officers would have to be familiar with 50 different state laws on concealed carry permitting. Given the split second decisions, our officers frequently need to make this is nearly impossible and can forcibly lead to violent confrontations. The strongest component of Georgia's carry license is its discretionary provision, which allows a judge to deny a license to someone who is deemed not to be a good moral character. A handful of those states that do not have a discretionary provision in their handgun carry license, these states are Minnesota, New Mexico, Nebraska, Nevada, Arizona and Washington state. So this means that people who would not be given a concealed carry handgun license if they lived in Georgia, they will be free to carry their handguns on Georgia streets, which will create a significant public safety threat to all Georgia residents. I asked Chairman Ballinger about this and she said she doesn't see this as a problem. She thinks this is a state's rights issue. But I ask, what about Georgia's rights? Our responsible gun owners have met standards and they should rest assured that other gun owners have as well. And let's talk about safety in a time where gun sales and gun violence have risen dramatically across the country. This bill would allow 17 additional states to have handgun carrying privileges in Georgia without any consideration of how strong or well run their permitting systems are. Some of these additional states do not require safety training, meaning more and trained people in Georgia will be carrying loaded handguns in public and may not know how to properly and safely handle a handgun. The amendment to 218, expanding emergency powers related to guns unnecessarily ties the hands of judges and public health officials during the state of emergency. The chief judge of the Georgia Supreme Court declared a judicial emergency last spring and instructed courts to suspend all but essential functions in an effort to stem the spread of COVID-19 virus. The counsel of probate judges, excuse me, the counsel of probate court judges of Georgia issued a memo temporarily suspending license carry renewals and permit applications as a response to local law enforcement limiting finger printing. And fingerprinting which is a requirement to obtain a carry handgun license and which helps ensure people with dangerous histories don't carry guns in public. This dangerous amendment would not allow judges the flexibility to take a pause. This amendment would curtail judicial discretion and hamstring local law enforcement during a time when the focus should be on public safety, not the ability to carry loaded handguns in public. Increasingly the amount of people walking around in Georgia streets with loaded handguns from other states in addition to unnecessarily restricting the authority of judges and public health officials during a public health emergency is irresponsible and unsafe. And let's talk about the impact, the expansion of concealed carry reciprocity and emergency powers related to gun victims of domestic abuse. As we've said, the strongest component of Georgia's carry license is its discretionary provision which allows a judge to deny a license to someone who is not a good moral character. Someone such as a domestic abuser. Because a handful of states will now be allowed to carry in Georgia that do not have a discretionary provision in their handgun carry license and Georgia officers have no way to verify if an out of state permanent is valid. It is possible that those with dangerous histories will be allowed to cross state lines to carry in Georgia, including domestic violence offenders. Back in 2019, during a morning order, I shared with you that at my church, the third Sunday of every month during our confession, we prayed by reading aloud the names of the victims of gun violence for the previous month. The murders, the suicides, the accidents, about 50 a month, 600 a year. We view this as a confession because these are preventable deaths. And gun violence is a sickness in our society. It was during one of these readings that I felt called to run to work on issues in policies that can change these statistics, ending social isolation, increasing access to mental health care, moving towards a restorative model of criminal justice and ending systemic racial equality, and also reducing easy access to guns. For years, we tied a ribbon for each victim, green for adults, blue for children, out on a string on our church lawn bearing witness to their lives. We brought that to an end, and we sent all of you a letter in a ribbon asking you to work on policies that would honor the lives of these victims. This past year, we worked on soul boxes, three-inch paper boxes that show the photo and name and keywords about the life of Georgians, and assembled these into large panels. And I regret to inform you that we had 1200 victims of gun violence in Georgia in 2020. In December, we went from 50 up to, I mean, around, we'd been having 50 in 2019, we had 98 gun violence deaths in Georgia in December. Each one of these was killed by a bullet shot from the barrel of a gun. colleagues, House Bill 218 does nothing to protect Georgians. Let's work together to pass safe gun ownership laws. We don't need laws that weaken our public safety. I ask that you join me in voting no for House Bill 218. Speaker, I yield the well. Lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is now in the previous question is ordered. There is a minority report on the bill. What purpose does the minority caucus will rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I'd like to make a motion that will you waive the minority report? You withdrawing it. Which will, yeah, but you withdraw the minority report. Thank you. Okay. The representative Wilkerson has asked, has moved to be permitted to withdraw the minority report. Is there any objection? Any objection, chair here is none, and the minority report is withdrawn. Any objection to withdrawing the Committee substitute? The chair here's none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the Committee on Rules? The chair here is none. The Rules Committee substitute is adopted.

The purpose does chairman Petrie rise. He waves. What purpose does representative Anola would rise. Thank you sir isn't not true that there are many people in our judicial community including some private court judges who are not in favor of this legislation. I'm sure if I know the lady to be a person of integrity and wouldn't state that if it weren't true but I haven't heard from them. We've all members voted what purpose is representative Neal rise. I guess she waves. Parliamentary inquiries? State your inquiry. Is it not true that this type of rest prosperity bill that has failed the Republican led Congress in 2015 2017 and 2019. Did it fail didn't that Congress? I don't keep up with Congress too much. Thank you even less now. What purpose does chairman Sensler rise. Parliamentary commissioner. State your inquiry. Initry this bill provides common sense provisions to protect firearm owners during states of emergency and that's very often the case. It's those most severe circumstances some folks might even own firearms so this is it is it is the chairman's chairman. It's a common sense bill that protects everyday people. If the gentleman so states I know he believes that to be true. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 218 the eyes are 103 the nays are 69 this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 34 House Bill 34 by Representative Belton of the 112th and others to be titled act to amend chapter 44 title 43 the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the speech and language pathologist and audiologist so it was to revise licensing provisions this bill I'm referred to the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Belton to present the bill. Thank you miss Speaker I rise to talk about House Bill 34 House Bill 34 is another compact again the I have a very nice letter from the Georgia Chamber who is supporting this and the reason I'm bringing this bill is because the Pentagon has directly asked for this it increases telehealth in Georgia it's a bipartisan approach and we we pass the bill like this bill Bill work either just a few days ago in the hope you can support me again today on speech pathology and audiologist compact I yield for questions. You do have a question if you care to yield I yield sir. Chair recognizes representative Bennett to your left for a question. Thank you miss the speaker with the gentleman yield. Yes ma'am. Is it not true that currently in the state of Georgia there's such a shortage in speech and language pathologist particularly in the practice of pediatrics that this compact would help to serve the citizens of Georgia. I agree I actually had saw a speech pathologist when I was a really young child and I know it is a lot for me although I'm certain folks with disagree me. Thank you. Thank you. Chair you have another question if you care to you. I'll give one more sir. Chair recognizes representative Wolenski in the gal and I'm sorry he's in room 341. I don't see him. Thank you speaker here let me slide over. Can you see me here? There you are. Thank you speaker does the representative yield. Hi yield sir.

I'm sure that to be the case sir. I yield the well. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair hears none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 34 the eyes are 165 the nasal one this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House bill 86 will be postponed until the next legislative day. The clerk will read the caption to HR 119. House resolution 119 vote votes of the seventh and others recognizing the United States Senator Johnny Isaacson and dedicating a bridge in his honor this resolution haven't been referred to the committee on transportation that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. The chair recognizes Speaker Ralston to present the resolution. Thank you very much Madam Speaker. It's a real honor for me to present to you House resolution 119 a resolution which honors former United States Senator Johnny Isaacson by dedicating a bridge in Chattam County in his honor. I want to first thank Chairman Hitchens for being the second signer on this resolution and for allowing us the opportunity to name this particular bridge for Senator Isaacson I think it's in his district. I'd also like to thank several other members of the coastal delegation for joining me on the resolution Chairman Ron Stevens Chairman Jesse Petrie representative Carl Gudiard and majority leader Burns. This bridge which would become the Senator Johnny Isaacson bridge is on state route 307 and sits over a portion of the Garden City terminal at our Portus of Anna just outside the main gate. It carries much of the truck traffic into and out of the Portus of Anna and it overlooks the new Mason Mega Railyard currently under construction which will expand the Portus freight rail capacity. The Savannah Harbor expansion project and the Mason Mega Rail project both received substantial federal support thanks to Johnny Isaacson so it is fitting that this bridge that you can watch Georgia's economy expand because of and through our deep water ports. Johnny Isaacson was and is a champion for economic development and job creation a veteran who made his career in real estate. Senator Isaacson believes that the best way to help people to lift our state up is to expand opportunity for everyone. He served our state in this house and across the hall in our state Senate. He also served Georgia in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate until his retirement due to health reasons in 2019. Johnny Isaacson is a great leader and a dedicated public servant but just as importantly he is a good and decent man. He treats everyone with respect and with a civility that is becoming all too rare these days. Senator Isaacson only delineates people into one of two groups to which you group you belong has nothing to do with race, gender or even political party. Senator Isaacson only knows people as friends or future friends. Everyone can look to Senator Isaacson as an example of what one person can do when they just do the right thing. I am honored and humbled to call him my dear friend and if he is watching at home I want to offer my personal thanks to him for his service in the very high bar he has set for public service. His example is one we would do well to follow and it is for that reason that I ask you to join with me in naming this bridge this important bridge for Senator Johnny Isaacson. Thank you Madam Speaker I yield the will. Gentlemen as yielded the well the chair recognizes representative Meeks to speak to the bell. Thank you Madam Speaker. Good morning ladies and gentlemen I come to the well in support of this important measure. A true friend to Georgia, a true statesman who served Georgia that he loves so much. As it has been mentioned having served in the General Assembly we know Senator Isaacson to be a man who went to Washington to seek resolution to problems working across the aisle with anyone and everyone whom he encountered. He was not afraid to work for the benefit to solve solve problems for all of Georgia's. I got to know Senator Isaacson during my time in Washington as a staffer. I am grateful that I did. To him you see everyone in the room was important whether you opened the door whether you were a staffer or whether you were the CEO of a company everyone was important.
