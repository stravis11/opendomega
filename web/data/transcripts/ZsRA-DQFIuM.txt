TRANSCRIPT
----------
All members of the field come to the floor. Mr. Clerk, were you ring the bell, everybody? No, we were getting ready to get started. Okay, member, we'll get started. Mr. Clerk, we'll, um, with the show on the road with Senate Bill 233. Mr. Clerk, were you ring the cap to the Senate Bill 233? Senate Bill 233 by Senator Brass of the Sixth to be entitled to an act to amend an Article of Section 66, Chapter 1, on the title of 37. The official go to Georgia and annotate it related to behavioral health reform and innovation commission. So, is to revise the subcommittees, Ms. Bill Heaven. Ms. Bill Heaven been assigned to the committee and the public and community health committee recommends that this bill do pass. All right, members, if you'll all please take your seats and give the lady who's coming to the well, your attention is she presents Senate Bill 233, representing Sharon Cooper, if you recognize her, presents Senate Bill 233. Chair Lady Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House. I'm bringing Senate Bill 233. This was requested by Commissioner Tanner as he runs our Department of Behavioral Health and Disabilities. This is about a commission that is housed there under him, the Behavioral Health Reform and Innovation Commission. It has been made up of 24 members and he asked that be extended to 30. When he took over, the commission was made up of mainly of health professionals, psychiatrists, different kinds of doctors, forensic psychologists, licensed clinical behaviors. And what they found out, they were really lacking in people who had experienced mental health problems themselves or their family members or they had lost a family member due to fentanyl or drugs. And this bill corrects that. It adds six members and they are specifically listed as someone who has lived experience having survived the disease of addiction or someone who has lost a member of his or her immediate family to drug overdose or fentanyl poisoning. So I would ask for your favoral consideration. I believe that will make the commission more inclusive and it did extend it for a year. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will leave the well if there are no questions. You have one question, yes, ma'am. Representative Gamble, to your right, straight out in front of you. This is General Lady Eild. I do. Is it not true that Commissioner Tanner and the Georgia Council on Recovery have been very instrumental working with you and so many of us on this piece of legislation. This is good for all of those Georgians, over 900,000 Georgians that are in recovery and we certainly want to see that number increase and this will help to do that. I appreciate the question from the member. What you say is certainly true and Commissioner Tanner has been doing an excellent job. Not just about mental health issues but also with our disability community. So once again, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable vote. Thank you. Ladies, you are the well. We have a couple of speakers. I'm going to recognize Rimsley Park Cannon and Rimsley Mary Margaret Oliver. Rimsley Cannon, I gave Rimsley Oliver heads up about five minutes. Max, can you do it in that length of time? Go for it. Rimsley Park Cannon is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're excited about this bill. Really looking forward to having some more members who are able to help us on this innovative commission. I do think that it's important that we consider possibly in the future adding paranatal providers to it since we are dealing with mental health outbreaks of those who have recently been pregnant. But I am here in support of it. I have spent time with many individuals who unfortunately have battled addiction, who have experienced overdose, and who are impacted by the decision making here today because the challenges surrounding behavioral health are multifaceted. We must draw the insights of those who have navigated those challenges firsthand. Our discussions will enrich our lives and make our policies more compassionate. It's necessary to continue this important work towards meaningful behavioral health reform that we have started many years ago. Many of you will see this is not a sprint. This is a marathon. It requires our sustained efforts, our commitment, and our patience with these individuals. I think this legislation does have some structural changes, but it's really fostering a culture of support and understanding for those experiencing addiction. I'm just grateful for this bill and invite you to vote yes with me. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your comments. Ladies, you are the well-represident. Steve, Representative Mary Margaret Oliver is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in support of Senate Bill 233. I've had the privilege of serving on this commission for several years. For those of you that might be new to the House, I'd like to tell you why this particular effort has been uniquely successful with the support of the governor, with the support of the speaker, and with the support of the lieutenant governor. You may be aware, I think you are aware, that this effort began under David Ralston, who came forward and told us members that he was tired of not being able to help the folks in his district with serious mental illness. He always said the same thing. He always said he was tired of not being able to help people. He said that his wife always told him that you've got to help people and not only think about elections. He said we're going to pay for what we do as we go, and he said it's going to be bipartisan. He stuck by that. And others have stuck by that too. The reason this has been successful is that there was a unified effort of leadership. We have over the last four years contributed over half a billion dollars of new mental health monies that's prior to whatever will make some progress with, hopefully, in this fiscal year 26 budget. It also gives credit to the structure, which we're changing a little bit in this bill. A positive change. The structure was not based on political appointees. There are only one or two House members, only one or two Senate members that's not changing. It was the professionals in the field from your districts in different categories of caregivers. And the substantive work that's gone on through the subcommittee process has been extremely strong based on professional expertise and not political agendas. The additions to the commission is set forth in 233, recognizing the very strong contributions, necessary contributions from the addiction community across Georgia. This has always been a mental health and addiction commission effort. And the addition of additional addiction related professionals and addiction related family members is strong. We also have an ongoing discussion. This is coming out of Chowah. It's coming out of your health care providers. What's the difference between the developmentally disabled and the mentally ill? And that conflict in some cases that combined diagnosis in other cases has reached us and we are particularly with leadership that's coming in a wide variety of ways from the settlement of the civil rights case in relation to the services to the developmentally disabled. This is a strong addition to the very strong history and basis. We're extending the commission for one year. Many commissions have served on, I've only served one year, they may or not even met. But this commission is unique and I ask for your support. Particularly the support of Commissioner Kevin Tanner who has a good leader does many, many hours of work, if not most of the work on this commission. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies, you all did well. Thank you for your comments. That completes our discussion on Senate Bill 233. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill or the hearing none the report of committee has agreed to? Now this bill now pass on in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no in Mr. Clerk. Will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the pass just Senate Bill 233, the yeas are 164, the nays are two. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there four passed? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 9, SB 9? I was just sitting here a minute ago. The bill is the 56 and others to be tied up to a men's part. One of Article 3, Chapter 12, Title 16, the fish coded, Georgia annotated relating the general provisions relative to the Senate and related offenses. So as to repeal and replace code section 16, 12, 80, this bill has a member for the committee on technology and infrastructure innovation. That committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair recognizes, Ripley Brad Thomas to present the bill. Representative Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to present Senate Bill 9. This bill was passed through technology infrastructure innovation committee. It was a house priority last year as HB 986. Unfortunately, it didn't quite get across the line in the Senate. So let's start by discussing the crime that's listed in this bill. In order to be found guilty of fraudulent election interference, you have to do meet the following criteria and I'm going to talk through them by line items. Line items 38 for 43 defines who this applies to and is specific to political organizations. We've roughly estimated this actually would apply to somewhere between 2 and 4,000 people statewide. It has to be materially deceptive. In order to do that, one, it has to depict a real individual that speech or conduct that did not occur in reality and it has to appear to a reasonable observer to be authentic. Three, it has to be uploaded and disseminated with the knowledge of its falsity, which is one of the highest standards that you would have to prove in court. Again, it also has to be, in line 46, it has to be within 90 days of an election, which is really important, this is a piece of information that 90 days tightly prescribes it to the election process, which makes sure that it doesn't hit any constitutional issues. Say you do meet all those criteria. If you do, this is the major change from last year's bill as the first offense is a misdemeanor. The second offense is a felony. Last year, the first offense was a felony. So what's not covered as a crime in this bill? Line 55-57. First amendment protected speech is not. I want to make that very clear. First amendment protected speech such as satire and parody has listed on line 56, aka memes are explicitly written as not applying it into this bill. If you create any media and provide a disclosure of its generated, you can create an image or a video or deceptive media, but it's not considered deceptive if you just put a disclaimer on it that simply says it's AI generated and it defines what that is. So here's another one that I got. I hate to tell you all, but people like me might need a little bit of help looking good visually. Thank you. And we may use AI to make us look a little bit better in particular media. This is explicitly, once again, lines 134, 136, minor editing is excluded from this bill. And again, if you can create content 97 days out and it's not affected by this bill, and I want to make something else clear, this is about visual and audio files. So text that you create, say you use an AI and you create text, that is not included in this bill. It's just visual and audio. So let me boil this down for you. If you get a cues of a misdemeanor first defense in this, this is what you would have to do. You'd have to be one of around a couple thousand people in the state that are specifically tied to political action campaign or committees, political committees or as defined in the bill. You'd have to create an AI generated video audio and distribute it with the intent to deceive and throw an election. You'd have to upload it within 90 days of an election. You didn't put a simple disclaimer on it that said it was AI generated and it had to be the level of quality that it was to deceive other vote, to deceive electorate. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I feel like I've presented the bill and I'd be happy to take questions. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. Revenue, the least a camel to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Can you just verify first what LC number we're looking at? 492385S. No, it's this. I'm on it. Okay. I got the. It may be LC. I'm sorry. I know. I'd rather. It's a different. I think the represent Williams. Although I would tell you my bill number is correct that I presented. It's LC 560401S. Oh, when is. Yes. Okay. Thank you. And will you accept another question? Absolutely. So I just want to make sure I understand any and all use of AI and campaign materials regardless of the scope and span is allowable as long as there is disclosure. I would say it's even more tightly prescribed than that within 90 days of an election. It's completely fine. It's not deceptive if you put a label on it that says it's AI generated. So thank you. And then minor editing would something like if you are using AI on yourself or someone else say you edit a facial feature. Would that be considered minor editing or not? No, no, because it doesn't change the substance of the actual image in and of itself. And that is I can find the line item in here where it's explicitly written but it is explicitly excluded. Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify what I'm reading is line 140, part B, minor editing of a piece of existing audio or visual which is a little broad so I'm just trying to understand maybe in a practical example. I would say if you've seen some of my campaign mailers I need a little minor editing that doesn't substantially change the observer's understanding of such media. And that's the point of making sure that a lot of Photoshop is regularly used and I don't mean to use Photoshop but it does have an AI component in it now and it's make sure we don't inadvertently capture that. And would you allow just a tiny bit of further clarification on this? My question is really trying to understand in past campaigns we've seen in oppositional advertising changes to your opponents features, not your own, your opponents. Would that be considered minor? I wouldn't say that it substantially changes the observer's understanding of the media meaning like if they change it to the point where they've now have that individual committing some crime that they didn't commit then that would be a substantial change but minor image changes wouldn't apply to this bill. Thank you. Chairman, you are representing the rise to your left. I just recognize for a question. Thank you Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Is it not true that by defining and criminalizing the use of materially deceptive AI, generated media and campaign advertisements this bill helps protect the integrity of George's elections and insurers that voters receive accurate information? I would agree with that. You know, we talked a lot and what people don't realize is we spent a significant amount of time on this last session with regards to making sure that we did not feel in any way we have infringed on First Amendment rights. But if we have multiple videos of elected officials that have deceptive material in it and there's no possible way to identify who's actually I would ask you whose First Amendment rights have been taken away. If no one can believe what you see then whose First Amendment rights has actually been taken away. It's been the person that did something that was proper or operated within the balance of what the law is. This is just simply to say that it's the elect the electorate know that what they have is AI generated or it happened in reality and I think that that's an acceptable place to be in a First Amendment situation. Thank you for the question. Do you have one more question if you want to take it? Then we have some speakers on the bill. Yes, Mr. Speaker. I'd be happy to take any questions. Representative Jasmin Clark to your left. He's running an ask for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it gentlemen you? I do. All right. So we had this conversation a couple of times about the 90 days and I understand that the I guess explanation for why you would say if it's 91 days you can do all these things but as soon as you hit the 90 day threshold it doesn't. I understand that it's something about legally how you can tie it to an election but could you not tie it to elections based on the content of what is being presented and doesn't this 90 days really handcuffs from protecting people because we're already seeing ads for 2026 now and I'm just a little worried that this still allows that deceptive material into the frame. Are you? So it's a fair question. The 90 days has been something that we now have 21 states that have adopted some version of this bill. I would say that the 90 day rule typically is in there to tie it to make sure it's specific to election but it also gives within 90 days you know a lot of campaigns don't have a lot of money. They're not a US size race that have the campaign funds to be able to combat this type of false or deceptive media. So keeping it 90 days at least it gives an opportunity for time for the campaigns to come back and put something out instead of it just being a last minute thing two days before the election day and it throws an election and that's really what this is all about. So thank you. Digital Man Further You. I'll be a little more. Really? Your quick question. Absolutely. I understand that but I think what you just said is what my concern would be if a campaign that is very well funded has 300 days or whatever 365 minus 90 is I don't feel like doing math. So I think that's not many days to make deceptive materials about you and then it's just the 90 day moratorium. How do you undo that damage and a lot of times in the law we use the word reasonable and why couldn't we just say if it could be reasonably assumed I don't assume it's not the right word but you know a tie it to a reasonable expectation that this was about an election so therefore you cannot do it this way. I'm just wondering if there's a work around. We get into this really question about first amendment rights and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can and by tying it to an election of the date we did it only further titans the I guess guardrails to make sure that if it does go across to the judicial branch and they want to take a look at it it's very tightly prescribed we feel like it can survive and eventually we will get some more guidance from the judicial branch on what's acceptable and what's not but right now I have to tell you this is one of the most tightly prescribed bills in the United States so thank you for the question. Thank you. With that Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Gentlemen is yielded the well. That completes the initial comments on the bill we have some folks signed up in favor of and those are opposed. I'm going to recognize the represent Charlie Spurd to speak to the bill. Reps any bird? Give the lady your attention please. Good afternoon. Thank you Mr. Speaker. My fellow Patriots I rise in fierce opposition to Senate Bill 9. A bill straight out of governor of California's playbook designed to crush free speech and silence we the people. It isn't just bad policy it is anti-mega anti-America attack on our rights. Last year Georgian stopped HB 986. Now the radical left is back with SB 9 speaking it through procedural tricks because they know we would never accept this tyranny outright. Its California's liberal style censorship criticizing criminalizing deceptive media within 90 days of an election who decides who's deceptive when 90 days of the election who decides who's deceptive. A government board by the same establishments that's used to us before. This isn't freedom it's so yet style control. SB 9 could jail you for so called deception exposing corruption on felony charges up to five years. We already have deception laws for lies that harm. This is silencing dissent plain and simple. If it passes Georgia becomes like California dissenters in handcuffs to my Republican colleagues do you want to be the ones who brought California liberalism agenda here to Georgia. This is about liberty itself it is not moving voting no. I'm rejecting this unconstitutional assault on the first amendment with everything I've got. When we come for our first speech free speech I am never going to stop fighting. Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Ladies you are the well we have several other speakers on the issue. I recognize RIPs of the trend for comments on Senate bill nine. RIPs of the trend. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I rise today in favor of SB 9. And to clarify I may look like an AID fake of the minority whip and the only Filipino member of the House but I am indeed not an AID fake of these members. In not seriousness just a year ago we saw New Hampshire doing the New Hampshire presidential primary a voice. Robo call one out to Democratic voters that imitated President Joe Biden's voice until Democratic voters not to go out and vote. And that is the danger of AID that poses us today. As we are in an arms race within the election campaign season those with the best technology can generate AID at the fastest levels with the deepest of fakes with the most realistic renderings of ourselves. And one day we are going to reach a point where technologically AID can generate these deep fakes at a speed where in a microsecond they can generate 365 days worth of campaign material to be used against us or used to defend us. So we have to be concerned because I am concerned about the human element of our elections. The most important part of our elections.

We go out to voters and we shake their hands, we listen to their concerns, we meet with them one on one. But if we hit a point in which we base our elections and win our elections on AI technology, we will lose that human element. We will lose the most precious part of our democracy. And that is hearing from our constituents. So with that Mr. Speaker I yield the well and ask the members to vote in favor of this vote. In gentleman as you are the well, the Ripley Sanchez has recognized to speak to the bill, Ripley Sanchez. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise also to speak in favor of Senate Bill 9. I believe this is a great bill that helps ensure our elections are not riddled with misinformation distractions and interference. In fact, I was actually talking to my family just the other day about this, why we don't have labeling of AI when you see it on social media. And I'm glad that this bill has this measure in it to help with that. Because a lot of people struggle to the afraid trade between something that's AI and something that's real. And that can have a huge impact on not just in our elections, but on daily life in general. And so I'm glad to have this measure in the bill for our election process at the very least. I know some of my colleagues brought up legitimate concerns about the 90-day window and I do agree that it should be longer, but I do think we have to start this now because we are currently have elections right now. In my county we have a special election in less than a month, right? And so we need and we have elections this November as well. So we need to do something as soon as possible around this issue because it's a growing and intense city in danger. And just in general, in regards to artificial intelligence, we have to remember that there's a lot of great uses for this technology, medical uses, efficiency, and certain sectors, but we always have to make sure when new technology emerges that we balance with the good and the bad that comes with every new technology. We have to make sure that we keep Georgia safe and well informed, especially in the times that we're in right now. I believe we need to make sure we target our use of AI to only where it's truly needed because as many of you know, AI has become a huge drain on our energy and resources. It's specifically when it comes to electricity demand and water consumption. And so it is a great tool, but some studies have actually shown that just to train the model of these kind of technology like OpenAI is GBT-3, it consumed over 1200 megawatt hours of electricity, which is the equivalent of powering 120 homes in one year. A carbon dioxide emission of 552 tons. The study was funded by Google who is implementing their own AI program, so it might even be undercounted. Throughout our history, we have seen new technology emerge that makes life easier, but with every invention we must learn the consequences of unchecked, unregulated use. Our environment, our air, our water cannot be disregarded in the pursuit of turning our family photos into studio-gibbly characters. If you get that reference, you're a real one. Once again, I support this bill as a great first step in sending up guard rail for this important emerging technology. I hope we continue working on this issue to continue to ensure safety and well-being of Georgians, and I urge you to vote yes on SB9. Thank you. You're the well, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. The gentleman's you were the well, who represented Beckles. The ladies recognize the speak to Senate Bill 9. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise in support of Senate Bill 9 of common sense measure to protect our elections from AI manipulation. This bill does two simple things. First, it makes it illegal to knowingly publish fake AI-generated videos or audio that falsely show candidates saying things they never said. But only when done to deliberately deceive voters within 90 days of an election. Secondly, it creates clear rules for campaigns that want to use AI content. They can still use it, but must include a disclaimer that clearly identifies what is AI-generated. This isn't about restricting free speech, political satire, poverty, art, or journalism remains fully protected. As technology advances, our laws must keep pace. This targeted bill protects voters from deception, why preserving our fundamental freedoms. I urge your support. Mr. Speaker, if I may, for this disclaimer, I did ask my AI cousin, Claude, to generate a floor speech that you guys can understand. Thank you, AI-Luel. Thanks, Claude. Whoever Claude is, Representative Williams, you know who Claude is? How do you think you did? Chairman Todd Jones recognized the speak to the bill. Representative Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Vance, I have your blue sheet up here. I'll bring it back for you. This is a serious subject and a serious day. I'm just going to take a few minutes of your time, but there's been a couple of things lov here that need to be addressed. The fact is, is that we are responsible in so many different ways, the 10.7 million Georgians, to ensure that when they go into the election box, they can trust that the election box is in fact filled with 100 percent integrity. We always argue about whether or not there should be paper ballots, machine ballots, machine score. We talk about audits. We talk about everything about what the voting process is, but I would argue with you, the most important thing we can do for our constituencies is to ensure that when they go into that box, when they are saying themselves, I'm going to cast the ballot for this individual or for this referendum, the most important thing we can do for them is make sure that we have given them accurate information. We cannot live in a world where our constituents 10.7 million Georgians, almost 6 million voters are asking themselves, what I just saw, is it real, or is it not real? At that point, the integrity of the election, no matter if you fall on paper ballots, or machine ballot is gone, we have to be able to vote towards what we know to be right. And let's talk about American. We talk about the Constitution. The Constitution speaks to the idea that if an individual is charged with something, they will face a jury of their peers. This does that, but it does it in such a way that it has the most loftiest bar. They must do it with specific intent. It must be proven that they knew the falsacity of it. They must have taken the action to download that video or that image. And it must be done in such a way that a reasonable person, a reasonable individual would say, this is in fact something that would affect the election, or infect the integrity of the election or the administration of the election. So I ask you this, Alabama, our sister to the West, and 21 other states, but I'll focus on Alabama, have taken the exact same language and unanimously put it through both chambers and a Republican governor signed it. A previous speaker spoke to the idea of liberty. We can all go on and on, and I'm sure many of you have, in your election, in your town halls, in any comments that you make to your peers, and to your constituents, all about liberty, and the fact that you've been called to serve in this chamber. You were called because you believed in the Constitution and you believed in making sure that everyone has the opportunity to, in fact, pursue life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What this document does is ensure that everything that our constituency is, in fact, something they can, in fact, take to the bank. And I ask you to support this bill. I ask for your favor, consideration and Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. That completes our discussion on Senate Bill 9. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? Here in none, the committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Here in none, the committee, the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Okay. Have all members voted for it, atenção, within our writings. Parliament's read in private. Station, quyser. Is it not true that the last speaker wanted to make sure mentioned that left-leaning radical liberal state of Alabama passed this bill? That's what I heard him say. Thank you, sir. The gentleman's correct. He'll have to correct that in the media. I won't create it for him. Now we have great friends over there. Speaker Ledbetter's a fine man. And I'm certainly, he does a great job in that Alabama house. Have all members voted? How all members voted this soon? Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine? On the passage of Senate Bill 9, the yeas are a 152, the nays are 12. This bill, Henry Z. The requisite cost of majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to SB 69 Senate Bill 6-9? Senate Bill 6-9 by Senator Kennedy, 18, to be entitled an act to amend Title 7. An article 5 of Chapter 11 and Title 9 of the Fifth Go to George Annotator relating to banking and finance and depositions and discovery under the Georgia Civil Practice Act respectively. So it's a regulate third party litigation financing practices in this state. This bill haven't heard the committee on rules. That committee recommends that this bill pass by rules, the committee substitute LC 49 23 94 s. Representative James Birchett has recognized to present Senate Bill 6-9 representing Birchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. I rise to giving my support to ask for your vote on Senate Bill 6-9. Senate Bill 6-9 seeks to fill a hole in the code. Currently, there are no provisions whatsoever that outline regulations on litigation financing. No, we're in a code where you find it. So what this bill seeks to do is put some guardrails and regulation on the industry. For some of you that don't know, there are companies out there that will finance litigation, and they will seek a interest in any judgment that is had in that litigation. And there has been testimony that suggests that some of these litigation finance years will influence how a piece of litigation is litigated. And in my opinion, that is not correct, not right. The financier should not weigh in on the decisions that the lawyer and the client make. And so what this seeks to do here is put some guardrails up around this industry. And so I'm going to run through some of what the bill does here. First off, it defines what a litigation finance here is. Currently, there is no definition in code. And also defines what a litigation financial agreement is or financing agreement is. It also puts in what provisions are required in a litigation agreement, some of which are the recital of what I just said is that the litigation finance here cannot weigh in on the process of litigation. Cannot, for instance, cannot say, all right, if you guys are going to settle, I don't want you to settle. This is not enough to settle for. That's one of the claims that I heard in testimony. Some of the other provisions it requires in these litigation agreements is that there can be no amendment of the contract without written agreement. Obviously, the clear name and principal address of the finance here, and it recites that again, finance here cannot inject themselves into the decisions of the parties or the litigators. What the bill also does, it defines who can be a finance here, litigation finance here. And it's in line with our financing institutions. In fact, it's in the code section for banks and banking. And what it requires is that, for instance, if much like a bank or a financing institution, if you had a felony in the past 10 years, you cannot be a finance here under this bill. It's one of the other things, and I'm sure we'll hear about if you're a foreign adversary of the United States has dictated by the federal government, then you cannot also be a finance here. One of the largest provisions in the bill is that it requires registration of these financeeers with the Department of Banks and financing. And also gives the ability of the commissioner to deny a finance here if they don't meet the requirements of this code section. While at the same time allowing for some due process for that finance here, if they disagree to request and writing a hearing to make their case. It exempts, importantly, I think, an agreement that it's taking a case on contingency between a party and a litigator or a lawyer. So if I want to take a case, and essentially I'm financing my fees and my work throughout the case, then it exempts that sort of arrangement. And that arrangement is pretty customary in some of these civil cases. It's one of the provisions in here is that if the financing agreement or the finance here does not come in line or comport with the provisions in this bill, then that contract is void or non-actionable. And then lastly, it says that any of these agreements are discoverable in litigation. So as a defendant, if a plaintiff is utilizing financing, then they can discover both the terms of the contract and what the contract is. So if I'm litigating against the party as the plaintiff, then I could discover whether or not, excuse me, as a defendant, I can discover whether or not the plaintiff is utilizing the plaintiff. The plaintiff is utilizing a finance here and then how much that finance here is financing of this litigation. I think what this bill does is puts regulation and parameters around an industry that is frankly wide open at this point. I know there's been many hours of testimony and debate over this subject matter. I'm asking, excuse me, my colleagues to please favorably consider Senate Bill 69. And the LC I'm reading from is LC 492394S. And with that, I'm going to speak her out of your questions. Jim has a question. Reps. Remind. I'm right up the center out on your left. There's a gentleman yield to my friend. I do. What's with the face? It's a fine question, I promise. Just to confirm this will not apply to bail funds, nonprofits, things like that, correct? That's correct, yes. There is a provision that I just spoke with one of my colleagues about the exempt nonprofits that it's online. Line 372. Gentlemen, you have another question? Yes, sir, one more. Representative Rice to your left. Straight way to your left. Is recognize for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Is it not true that prohibiting entities with foreign affiliations from acting as litigation financiers, safeguards our judicial system from potential external influences? I can't agree more representative. I think this preserves the sanctity of our civil justice system as well as gives protections to consumers and litigants in the process. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the welcome. The gentleman is yielded the welcome. We do have one speaker signed up to speak to the bill. Mr. Chairman Todd Jones. Chairman Jones is recognized to speak to SB 69. Representative Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and my apologies to the body. I don't typically get up and speak and now twice in a row. But I thought this was so important because of the conversations that we've had over the last two years, about third party litigation funding. If you think about a phraseology that you hear from our constitutional officers consistently, is where number one business, I pardon me, the number one state to do business. You hear that over and over, that 11 straight years we've been the number one state to do business. I want to try and make an argument with you very quickly that what we should really be looking forward is to be the number one in innovation, the number one in thought leadership. Because here's a piece of data that I think should concern this entire body and our friends across the third floor. We are eighth in GDP. New Jersey is ninth. North Carolina is tenth. The challenges our growth rate is literally a third of North Carolina is in a half of New Jersey's. Which means by about 2030, we will drop to 10 and possibly by 2035 drop to 11. We have to be thinking of different ways to get more innovation into our economy, into our industries. One of the ways that we protect innovation is to ensure that bad actors don't capture trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property through bad actors and the litigation process. Third party litigation funding has a purpose and I agree with the whip. But it also could be used as a sword against our nanotechnology companies, our logistics technology companies, our cyber companies. How do we ensure that that doesn't occur? SB69 does that. So I ask for your favoral consideration for all the reasons that the majority whip laid out for you. But I would also ask you to add just one additional component. And that component is about the future of Georgia. It's not about 2025 or 2026. It's about 2030 and 2035 and 2040. We must protect the intellectual property of not just our large corporations, but what I hope to be the next apple, the next HP, the next Google inside of some garage here in Atlanta, or in North Georgia, or in South Georgia. Let's protect them. Let's protect the future and let's make sure that we keep Georgia on a pathway, not just to be eighth in the union in GDP, but hopefully one day, jumping up to number one and unseating that state that sits on the west coast. Thank you very much and I yield the well. Number one, I like the way that sounds. That completes our comments. So I'm going to ask you a question on Senate Bill 69. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. We do have a minority report up to minority report is waived. Thank you. Is there any of excuse me? Is there any objection to redrawing the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Here in none the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report of the committee's agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. Will yes, all those opposed? Will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate Bill 69, the yeas are a 98, the nays are a 69, this bill, Henry C. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate Bill 105, 105? Senate Bill 105 by Senator Anna de Barreta, 31st and others being titled an act to amend chapter 50 to title 43. The official code of Georgia annotated related to veterinarians and veterinary technicians, so it's authorized licensed. Licensed veterinarians and veterinary technicians to practice veterinary tele-advice, this bill having referred to committee on agriculture, consumer affairs that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Transportation chair, Jasper's recognize to present the bill, represent your Jasper's. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members. Senate Bill 105 is for the expansion and the use of telemedicine in the veterinary practice. I was asked to do this bill, I kind of went sentimental. I have two great veterinarians in my life that have taken care of my kids, animals, my foragers, my FFA kids, and our community, Mike Christopher and Dr. Mike Zager, and I hope they're listening. What this bill does is enforces the veterinary client-patient relationship that is the bedrock of a veterinary practice. This means practically for you that every veterinary practice will have to have a relationship with your animal before they can diagnose it using telemedicine. It's the same way they do it now. You've had many bills that over the past few years, these are telemedicine and medicine and dentistry and all sorts of things, and the veterinarians have worked hard on this. So if your vet offers telemedicine, you'll be able to use your phone, your iPad, to communicate with your veterinarian. Now this is really very important in large animal veterinary practices, where there's a shortage of big shortage of veterinarians and many miles between them and your care. This will help a lot in improving that care. In the bill you'll notice there's a lot of language that's got the use of telemedicine. These veterinarians are very thorough in writing a bill. Also in this bill you'll see teletriage and tele advice. Teletriage is used to determine whether or not immediate referral is needed to a licensed veterinarian. You'll be able to call and have that done. Now just like I said a moment ago since she don't have the veterinary client relationship, they cannot diagnose. Tele advice is what it says, it's like to say it's call event. You'll be able to ask general questions. The key thing in all three of these sections is that Georgia licensed veterinarians are doing the work and their associates and their offices. Someone asked me about pay a few minutes ago, this bill does not address pay. These are small businesses, they'll do pay as they choose. But it does create a very clear framework. In section four you're going to see House Bill 91 that was done by Chairman Cooper before crossover. So we've seen it and voted on it past it easily. This will allow those who have graduated from a foreign school, a veterinary medicine, a pathway to practice and most importantly teach in Georgia. And we are sort of the specialties across our state or in our state education. And they'll be able to do it, but they have to be licensed in Georgia. This gives them a pathway to do it. This legislation is the work of Georgia Veterinary Medical Association, the cattleman's association, pleasure animals, all the different ones that have their input in it. And Mr. Speaker and members, our veterinarians are very serious about the care pets. They're pleasure animals and are food animals. And they work very hard to improve the ability of care in the smarter and age. And I ask for your favor, consideration vote on this measure for our veterinarians. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. You have at least one representing Barnes to your left represent a mighty Barnes. Thank you for speaking. Those are gentlemen. Yes ma'am. You said we had a shortage of veterinarians. Do we also have a shortage of vet techs as well? Oh, absolutely. All right. Thank you. Well, I hope this helps out for our shortage in the state. Thank you. Yes ma'am. If I ask anyone else no further questions. Thank you, I sure will vote. Thank you. Thank you for presenting the bill. I know you know a lot about animal husbandry. That's where you came from. So thanks for your work and your career and thanks for bringing the bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill.

We were just talking to people who served in Heinzville ford Stewart area and Hata Army airfield But we welcome any veterans that would like to join us

Well, yesterday in, there were four military people missing in the Thuania when I was certain of their fate at this time, so we were asking this house to go in prayer for their safe discovery and they may be returned to their families safe and sound. We don't know what the outcome will be, but I do know that the factual prayers of the righteous availeth much. So prayer is needed now as these both that fight hard for their country, have left their families behind leaving Fort Stewart in the Third Infantry Division and were joined by former members of the Third Infantry Division and certainly veterans from this house. And we'd like to ask for your prayers for them and their families and hopefully we'll have good news to report and a dare to. May we? Amen. Thank you. Thank you. As members of your remains standing, we're going to recognize Representative Carpenter, Jason Ridley, Representative Jason Ridley and Chairman Tarbin, to recognize Anke Delus for the passing of one of the citizens in their area. Who's going to speak, Representative Tarbin? Chairman Tarbin? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Ridley had to leave quickly and nothing urgent, but this is a very strange eulogy, I guess I might present. This is a very good friend of mine and I want you to do something. I want you to remember this name. His last name is C-O-F-I-E-L-D, Co-Field, Charles Co-Field, from Chatsworth, Georgia. I want you to read these a bit, you're very. It's a good read. Very unusual. I want to tell you a little bit about Charles. He's first on a condolences of the military, his wife and his family, some special friends in his company that are very special to me. They know who they are. As I heard about this in red, I thought of things in Charles' life that I knew. Boy's life magazine, of course, Boy Scouts, Norman Rockwell, painting, Tom Sawyer, Newt Rockney, Thomas Edison, John Wayne, and Father Knows Best. Each time I left with Charles, left speaking with him, if I rode in a car with him on entry up or spent time with him playing cards, I never left. That I didn't feel better about humanity and I didn't feel better about myself. Charles was a mentor, a motivator, and built character among his employees. He will be greatly missed. I will finish by saying, I'll see you again someday, because... Sorry. Every community has people that make it a better place. Charles Cofield was one of those people. He was very accomplished, but what had made him special was his presence when he walked in a room, whether it was surrounded by millionaires or ditched diggers. Charles, aka John Wayne, had the unique ability to make you listen. His wisdom and his stories never got old. He invested in people. He was having a conversation with and mentored countless of business owners in Northwest George and around the world, including myself. It was an honor to be his breakfast cook for 25 years. His wife and family employees all have a huge void to feel, and we could not let this day pass today's the day of his funeral without paying homage to this one of a kind individual, Rest in Peace, John Wayne. Thank you members. Sounds like a very special man. A rips of the bail has remembered, this feels... Remain standing on a passing of a loved one. Thank you for speaking for this knowledge. Colleagues, I feel like I've been keeping the secret. My grandmother passed on March 9th, and I just would like to give her a moment for remembrance. Reverend Church was deeply influenced by her family's values of hard work and education. With her laboring father as a poolman porter that provided for her family and her mother, ensuring that she had an academic foundation, began to expel college nursery school. She pursued her education through segregation, excelling at Ashby Street School, Pugerti Washington High School, and later earning the bachelor degree in arts, and in bachelor degree in biology and a minor in mathematics from Spelman College at the age of 20, and under master's degree in library science from the Atlanta University as a fellow of the Andrew Carnegie Library, she embarked on a distinguished career in library science beginning to get Howard University. Reverend Church was a dedicated civil rights advocate supporting her husband Dr. Roy C. Bale and her cousin Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. specifically in the work of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and instrumental to the desegregation of Greater Memorial Hospital. But her life kept unfolding. At 57, she became a real estate broker. At 74, she became a ordain minister. At 77, she earned a doctorate in ministry. And at 90, she was still driving to church, housing the unhoused, and dancing through life with style and grace. Even in her final years, she mined, even in her final years, her sharp mind and humor and quick, and her faith was unwavering. Reverend Church has lived no drains on pursuit, no lessons unlearned, and no love, unexpress. Her tenacity and prayers and legs she lived on as lived on with us. She kept unfolding until the day of her life and had completed her masterpiece. Earlier this year, I gave you all the book, and if you just, if you will please continue staying with me. If I read a prayer, please assume you're a prayer. Dear Lord, you said in your word out of the abundance of your heart and the mouth speaketh. Father, it is out of the abundance of my heart that I speak love. I speak appreciation. I speak thanks. I speak joy. I speak blessings. I speak peace. I speak good success. I speak victory. I speak prosperity. I speak hope. I speak faith. I speak these things by the power of the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Lord, for living within me. For your word, say greater is He that is in me than He that is in the world. Thank you, Lord, that I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me. I know the Lord is in you. I live, I know the Lord in you. I live and move and have the being and have my being. I give all the glory and honor to you. It is, it is in the precious name of the Jesus operating. Amen. Thank you, miss Speaker. I yield the will. The memorial service will be tomorrow at the Waterfaith Cathedral 11 o'clock. The visitation will be at the Murray Brothers funeral home this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. Nothing like him in a wonderful grandmother. It sounds like you had one as well. I condoses to the family. Riftiny Park, Kenan, has recognized for an afternoon order. Members, I guess folks joining you. Rift and Kenan friends. Has this condolences? Rift and Kenan, no it's not. Y'all may be seated. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Four years ago, my life changed here at the state capital. There was a two-page election bill that overnight became a 20-page election bill, Senate Bill 202. Our chamber adjourned for the day. Many members went out to the right down the stairs and I got a text message that said that that bill was being privately signed in the governor's office. I went down the left hand stairs here and shortly after was unlawfully arrested, taken to Rice Street jail, given two felonies, which I would have had to serve eight years. When I came back that next day with my arm in a sling because of the treatment that I received, there were some members who disagreed with me. There were many members who stood with me. I want to thank those who stood with me and I want to thank those who disagreed with me because it has really matured me as a person. It has helped me to understand that I am in this work for good trouble. I would like to thank Dr. King and his family. His family actually came and walked me back into the state capital. There were a number of community members who were shirts and came in line the hall so that I felt safe that day coming in the state capital. Even right now, as we speak with John Lewis up in heaven, I can hear him being so proud of me on that day. He used to always say, Park, you're so young. Park, you're doing it. Park, keep going. Park, keep the fight. Keep the spirit. Today I come to you to let you know I started a phrase then on which I knocked on that door that we will keep knocking. I hope that you too find a way to keep knocking in your community. Sometimes those doors shut in front of you and sometimes they open. As an update on my cases, I am now unfortunately having to sue the state of Georgia. I had my day at the Georgia Supreme Court in May and found out unfortunately that I was not successful in my case. And so now I have a few other cases and a few other divisions seeking justice in the state of Georgia. And until we seek justice, we keep knocking. Thank you very much for your attention today. I am. The Ripson Rule Mine is recognized for an afternoon order. And friends. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I grew up here. And words like liberty and freedom and protection from tyranny actually deeply mean something to me personally. They're not rhetorical devices I use to appeal to the other side. They are actually things I grew up sincerely and deeply holding as a priority in my life. And after today's conversation, it made me kind of realize we are in a bubble right now because next week session ends and so we're all trying to get our bills done and I get that. But right now around the country, there are people who when they are walking down the street are being approached by masked, unidentified people put into unmarked cars and disappeared sometimes for weeks on end. This is not an exaggeration. Many of you have spoken to me about various policies as a released immigration enforcement and reassured me that whatever we do here is all about getting the criminals. Well, I can tell you right now that I know plenty of people who are not criminals that are literally being disappeared. That is not an exaggeration. And in addition, those that we know of are legally here under visas, under green cards. And the administration has explicitly said they are not charging them with crimes. And yet somehow we have now found a way to criminalize speech because anybody who stands with me as a Palestinian or my community is now being deemed as a terrorist sympathizer. The thing about liberty is that it is actually much easier to lose than we think. And a lot of times we end up being manipulated to willingly give it away. So today I was frankly inspired to come to this after an order last minute because I really sincerely hope that in our weirdly sort of media driven world that we can for once look and critically assess the decisions being made with our support. And what they could mean across the board. And as I always say, the unintended consequences. I am deeply, deeply, deeply fearful of the road that we are on right now. When somebody who is unidentified can just put you in a car, that to me is terrifying. So colleagues, please keep an ear out on your constituents, keep an eye out for your constituents, because unfortunately we are now hearing these cases regularly multiple times a day. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That completes our afternoon orders. Mr. Clare, would you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions?
