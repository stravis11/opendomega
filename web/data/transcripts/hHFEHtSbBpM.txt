Hi.
Good morning, everyone.
It is my distinct honor and pleasure to be here this morning and I'm going to start off
first by introducing our new president of Mercer University.
She is a double bear and has been working with the University of Mercer University for
the last 25 years.
So it's a very distinct honor to get to represent her, and we have Dr. Penny Elkins, can you please
stand?
So thank you very much, and we're very excited to have you here.
And next is our chaplain of the day, ironically, does not need much introduction.

sharing a word and a prayer in my faith tradition.
But the truth that share is universal.
I remember as a child that one of the first Bible verses
I ever learned, and that's the one I want to use today,
was from Ephesians 4, 32.
And be kind one to another, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another, even as Christ, God for Christ's sake,
has forgiven you.
You know, kindness and forgiveness, those are universal truths.
And that passage had an impact on my life from the very beginning, even to the point because
it helped me gain a perspective on how to deal with people.

Students in creative writing because of the masterful way that it was written.
And even Oprah Winfrey has praised Theo of Golden as one of the best books she ever read
describing it as epic and transporative.
And she notes that her favorite quote for 2026 comes from that book.
For anything to be good, truly good, there must be love in it.
Well, I ask myself why in the world would this book from a man in Hamilton, Harris County,
Georgia, one of your constituents, how in the, or what do y'all's constituents, how in
the world with that book have such meteoric rise and so much interest on the part of people
across the country.
Levi's book, I believe, is quenching a thirst that people have.

It would be satisfied every day, just a sip, just a moment, looking another person's face.
And as you begin your legislative journey in 2026, I would urge you to remember to be
kind one to another, tender-hearted, knowing that for anything to be good, truly
good, there has to be love in it. You do a remarkable job of representing the
people of the state of Georgia. I am so grateful for your service. My
encouragement to and prayer for you is that the kindness that is the desire of
your hearts and of your being will dominate your spirit throughout this
session and in all things that are part of your lives. May God bless each one of
you. Each one of you as I look into your faces. Each

want to thank everyone who called, sent text messages and came to support my
family. She was an incredible, captivating woman. She and my father met when they were
in college at Florida NM. She would come down and you know just surprise me. That picture
that you see was on my father's birthday. They surprised me one day. If you met her,
you loved her. And I know many of you in here met her when they surprised me. She and
my father would watch every single session together. So I know my father is watching right
now that I want you to know that mom is still with us.
Remember your marching orders that she gave us as she passed
and that was for us to continue to love each other
and continue to work out that, get your miles in.
