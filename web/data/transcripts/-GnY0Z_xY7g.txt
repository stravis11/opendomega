Good morning.
Hope everyone had a great weekend.
We will begin our day and week with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 170 second house district,
Chairman Sam Watson.
Chairman Watson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I tell you, it's always an honor to bring our pastors
to the Capitol, to allow them to share.
And I think there's no better way to start the day
than this, so thank you.
But today, I bring my pastor, the Reverend Matt Peek.
Matt is originally from Tomiston, Georgia.
He had graduated from the Grange College in 2008.
While attending the Grange College,
he was asked to serve as the youth minister there
at East Vernon Baptist Church in the Grange.
And that is where Matt truly found his calling.
In 2009, first Baptist Church,
Maltry hired Matt to serve as our youth minister.
Of course, we quickly realized that he was gifted
at sharing the gospel with youth and adults alike.
But Matt also found his bride in Maltry.
And so we thought that was a win-win.
And anyway, in 2014,
God called Matt and Leanna to tell him first about his church.
And so we were disappointed to lose them,
but we also knew that God had a plan
for this young preacher.
But in late 2019, our senior pastor retired
and the Lord called Matt back to motry
and Leanna and the kids.
And so we were excited to have them back.
He does a phenomenal job at sharing God's Word
and ministering to the people,
not only in our church, but in our community as well.
But his wife, Leanna, him and his wife, Leanna,
have four beautiful children, Maddie Claire, John David,
Ellie, and Ruthie.
And so I know they're probably at home watching a dad on TV.
But I was trying to think about how to introduce Mad
this morning.
And so I was reminded of his sermon yesterday
and what he preached about yesterday.
And he talked about how God is good.
God is, regardless of the circumstances,
God is always good and he's always faithful.
And that's what I would say about Matt.
He is good.
Teaching and preaching are no doubt the duties
that lie nearest to him.
And I hope he's going to bring something good
and much needed to us today, the Reverend Matt Pete.
Well, good morning.
Thank you Speaker Alston for the invitation to come and share with you today and I appreciate all of you members of the House
We're inviting me to come and share a word today from from God's Word. I want to thank you first of all for your service to our state
As Sam mentioned, I'm a lifelong resident of Georgia and I'm grateful for all that you do to keep our state running running well
I want you to know that we pray for you specifically as a church as a church family
We pray for you that the Lord will give you wisdom and God you and your decisions as a matter of fact
We had a special time of prayer before this most recent session that the Lord would guide you and the decisions that you make
You know as a representative of Watson mentioned earlier like I said I was born here in the state. I was born over on the
On the Georgia coast I grew up in the hills and the woods of central Georgia and
Since 2004 my family has resided down in South Georgia along with about 8 billion mats
but we are glad to be there and we are thankful to be serving now at our first
Baptist of Motri. But you know as a student growing up here in Georgia I
remember as a middle school student the only other time I had been to this
building was as a middle school student on a field trip. I remember coming here
with my class and unfortunately as a middle school student I was not as much
interested in bills as I was interested in girls so I don't remember too much
about that experience but I am grateful to be here this time with a better
understanding of what you do and a greater appreciation of the service
that you provide to our great state. But you know, being from South Georgia, I'm
not as familiar with Atlanta, I'm not as familiar with the streets here in
town. So I have to rely on some good directions to get me into where I needed to
go. And I'm grateful for the directions that the speaker's office provided to
me to get me here on a timely manner to get here at the right time. But it
reminded me of a story I once heard about the great preacher Billy Graham, you
Billy Graham, a faithful minister for many years, and as the story goes, Billy Graham once
went to a town to preach a crusade, and as he was there, he had the need to mail something
at the local post office.
But being the first time there in town, he wasn't exactly sure where to go, so he saw
a young child playing on the street corner there on the sidewalk, and so he went up to
the boy and he said, son, would you mind telling me how I can get to the post office?
So the boy told him the directions turn here, turned there, and Billy Graham thanked him,
and he said, hey son, he said, tonight,
if you'll come to the football stadium,
I will tell you how you can get to heaven.
And then a little boy responded, no thanks.
You don't even know how to get to the post office.
Well, I'm proud to tell you I know how to get to the post office.
And I now know how to get to the Capitol
and can find my way to this room.
But today I want to take just a moment
and talk to you about finding your way
when you don't know where to go
and when you don't know what to do.
You know, this last year has been a very difficult year
for all of us who have been in leadership,
those of us in church leadership
and government leadership like yourself.
We've been through a very difficult season.
A lot of difficult decisions have had to be made.
We've been through an unprecedented time
with the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it leads to a very important question today.
What do we do when we don't know what to do?
Have you ever had a time when you just frankly
didn't know what to do?
Whether it was a decision that you were a part of
or maybe a vote comes up on this house floor,
how do you vote?
What should you do?
What do you do when you don't know what to do?
Well, I would encourage you today to follow the example
of the great Billy Graham and ask for directions.
When you don't know what to do, ask for directions,
but it's not so much asking for directions
that as it is knowing whom to ask for directions.
And so with that in mind this morning,
I'm gonna briefly tell you a story from scripture
about a man who didn't know what to do
and how he asked for directions.
The man's name was Jehosephat.
He may have had a very weird name,
But Jehosephat was the king of Judah
back in the Old Testament times.
And Jehosephat was a good king.
He loved the Lord and he desired to do what was right
and lead the people of Judah to follow God in his commandments.
But unfortunately, one day, King Jehosephat looked out
of his window and he noticed that there were armies
marching against him and the people of Judah.
There were many soldiers from foreign lands
who had gathered to come and to lay siege upon Jerusalem
and his people.
And Jehosephat, frankly, didn't know what to do.
So what he did was when he didn't know what to do,
He decided to ask for some direction, and so we called out to God in prayer.
If you go in your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 20, you can read the Word for Word, the
prayer of Jehosephat, when he didn't know what to do, is enemies pressed in around him.
But I would like to read for you just very briefly, one verse.
2 Chronicles chapter 20 verse 12, Jehosephat prayed, oh our God, we are powerless against this
great horde that is coming against us.
We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.
Joseph had didn't know what to do, but he knew who did.
And so he called out to the Lord in prayer
and he asked God to provide the direction
that he so desperately needed.
And you know, if you keep reading in second chronicles,
do you know what happened?
God heard his prayer and he responded
and he gave Joseph that in only direction,
but he gave in victory.
God told Joseph that he didn't even have to lift the finger
that God would take care of his issue
and God caused all the enemies of Judah
to fight amongst themselves until there was not
a single one left.
and God miraculously delivered the people of Judah that day
as a result of the prayer of King Jehosephat.
And so ladies and gentlemen of the house,
my prayer for you today is that you will keep your eyes
on the one who knows what to do.
I know that there are gonna be times maybe even today
as you meet in committees or as you even meet on this house floor
and you are voting or making decisions.
There are gonna be moments where you question
what you should do, question what is right,
question what is the right direction that you should go?
What is best for our state?
There are going to be moments
when you do not know what to do.
And in those moments, I encourage you to call out
to the one who does.
To call out to the Lord for wisdom.
He tells us that if we call to Him,
He will answer us and tell us great and mighty things
that we do not know.
So whatever situation you find yourself in today
and in the coming days, I implore you
to call out to the Lord for directions.
Whether you think you know what to do or not,
frankly, it doesn't matter what we think,
it matters what the Lord thinks.
And so I encourage you to seek Him in all the decisions.
And if you do, the Lord will see you
to where you need to go as you follow him.
Would you stand and let's join together in prayer this morning?
Father God, I thank you for your word.
And I thank you for the opportunity today to gather
with these fine ladies and gentlemen
and share in time in your word together.
I thank you for each of them Lord.
I thank you for what they do.
I thank you for the dedication,
their dedication father to the people of this state.
I thank you for the sacrifices that they make God
to come here, to make decisions and to lead our state well.
Father, I ask that you would bless them,
ask that you would protect them,
ask God that you would give them the energy
and the strength that they need, Father,
to accomplish the task that is set before them.
And Father, I pray that you would help them
to be people of integrity and every decision that they make.
And Father, would you guide them?
Would you tell us in your word, the word we read today,
Lord, when we don't know what to do, you do.
And so Father, may we all be a people
who look to you, Father, for direction and for wisdom.
Father, our world has many ideas of what is right,
but Father, you set the standard
and so God may we lean on you.
We love you, Father, may we look to you, Father,
and may you lead us as we follow you.
And we ask all these things in the name of your Son
who gives us salvation.
We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
Amen.
Would you join me in the Pledge of Allegiance?
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.
and through the Republic for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

Okay, we're going on now to morning orders, going on to morning orders.
If you have signed up for a morning order, Chair is going to ask that you limit your remarks
to no more than two minutes each.
And also, if you signed up for one to make you wait at the front of the chamber, Chair
recognizes Chairman Darlene Taylor for a morning order.
The House will be at order.
Chairman Taylor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I come to honor one of South Georgia's favorite sons, Jackie Robinson.
He was born it was 102 years ago yesterday, January 31, 1919 in Cairo, Georgia, to Jerry
and Mallie Robinson, Jackie was the youngest of five children.
After his father left his family, the mother moved them to Pasadena, California.
He graduated from Washington, Junior High School, and went on to John Moore High School,
where his athletic abilities were discovered.
He excelled in many, many sports.
When completing his studies in high school, he attended Pasadena Junior College where he
graduated in 1939.
He enrolled at the University of California and became the university's first student
to win a varsity letter in four sports, baseball, basketball, football, and track.
Jackie's oldest brother, Matthew, inspired him to pursue his talents and love of athletics.
He won a silver medal in the 200 meter dash just behind Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics.
But we remember him as one of the most inspiring and towering figures of the 20th century.
Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play Major League Baseball in the United
States.
On April 15, 1947, he broke the decades-old color line of Major Baseball.
Not only did he set an example, but he helped a whole generation of young African American
players enter Major League Baseball.
After Robinson's death in 1972, his wife Rachel established the Jackie Robinson Foundation.
It's dedicating to honoring his life and work.
The foundation helps young people in need by providing scholarships and mentoring.
It lives on today in Cairo in our Boys and Girls Club, which is named after him.
I leave you with one of his quotes.
A life is not important except in the impact
it has on other lives.
Thank you.
I yield well.
Chair recognizes representative Bodie
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise this morning at the loss of my dear friend,
Merrick Johnson, the third of making Georgia.
A lot of you know that this session has been quite difficult
for me and my family.
I have now lost two grandmothers, a best friend,
and a great aunt in the span of a 30 days.
I normally do not come to the well on personal issues
but strictly for policy.
But when I saw my dear leader and dear friend,
James Beverly speaking on behalf of my grandmothers,
I didn't have to do it myself.
But my friend, Mary Johnson, suffered from MLS.
He was diagnosed in 2011.
He was confined to a wheelchair seven, eight years ago.
But that did not keep him from serving
the citizens of Macon, Georgia.
In a wheelchair, he was able to continue
to serve his community.
Last year, he ran for a special election
to the Macon Water Authority,
it served as a board member for an uninspired term.
He had to run again, this fall in November.
He did not prevail, but he kept serving.
He served the 100 black men of making in middle Georgia.
He served the making one of Ramas,
alumni chapter, cap alpha side fraternity,
and corporate for which I'm a proud member.
He did not stop serving.
And so friends, I'm asking you in this body
that it really won't matter what bill that you pass HB101,
HB102, but the service to your community,
the service to your constituents,
and the service to your district and the state of Georgia
will be what you're remember for.
So when last time I talked to Jade, my friend,
he said, I gotta keep serving.
So I'm asking you all here, politics aside,
policy aside, people first and constituents first.
Let's all continue to serve.
And I want to remember today, for my friend
on the first day of Black History Month,
Jay, Mary Johnson, as my hero, my Black history.
Trebleys, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Glanton
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
I can't tell you what a great honor it is and it's quite humbling for me to be standing
before you today on other circumstances.
But I am honored to be here this morning and humble.
Today I have a black history moment.
I was not aware that we had two others, but that's okay.
My black history moment this morning is about a gentleman that most of us know.
one that we see almost on a daily basis or hear about or know about. And if I began to
talk about all the things that this gentleman has accomplished and done, it's legendary.
And we wouldn't have enough time if I took all week to tell you about the great accolades
and things that he's received and the achievements that he's accomplished throughout his life and
his service to this state in this country.
My black history moment this morning is on the one and only Calvin Smiley.
As I said, I have about seven pages of things that I know the speaker ain't going to live.
And I'm not going to do seven pages, but I'll give you a few more, a little bit more time.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You'll have generous leader Beverly come on and start taking the pages away from you.
But I would tell you that rather than go through his professional and political careers,
I will tell you that what's most outstanding for me is his character, his integrity, his
servant leadership, his desire to get up each and every day and do something for someone
else.
I don't have to tell you this because you see this.
You know this.
You have witnessed this.
In his very seldom, I've been all around the world, I've met a lot of legendary people,
but his very seldom that you have the opportunity to stand side by side of such a legendary
gentleman as Cavern Smiley.
He has helped so many people throughout his travels, boys and girls, men and women
that he would never ever know, but have benefited from the things that he's done.
Just to mention a few, the Georgia Dome, the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, the changing
of the Georgia State Flag, serving and the Board of Trustees of Columbus State University,
a lot of different universities throughout this state.
38 years with Sonovus, 47 years with the Georgia General Assembly, you don't get there
by being selfish.
And so I'd certainly thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the extra time.
I wish I could tell you so much more about this man.
But if you ever get an opportunity, read up on it.
I learned some things.
And so Dean of the House, thank you for the example
that you have set for me.
Thank you for your honesty, your integrity, and your character.
and thank you for your love of this chamber.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen,
I yield the will.
The representative encouraged everyone to read up on Dean Schmory.
better yet just spend some time with you. You don't know you're in a special
please. Chair recognizes
representative Wade thank you
Mr. Speaker and as a freshman I have
no idea how I can follow that but
I do appreciate the opportunity to
be here with all my peers. Today I just wanted to bring a little bit of good news from back
home and I know we've had a tough, you know, 12, 13 months in this state and in this nation,
but I also want to showcase that while there is trouble and trial, there's also a lot
of excellence going on. And today I bring to you from my hometown, the story of a young
man. His name is Palmer Hartley. He's a junior in high school and he was recognized as
As the state winner of the Georgia Music Educators Association, composition contest.
This young man wrote an entire music piece, as well as all the lyrics for a song called
Journey to the Stars, and it was performed recently on you this weekend in our hometown
for the entire state.
This young man is a junior again, he plays trumpet in the band, and he's an aspiring film composer.
And I just come to you today just to recognize that while there is trouble in our land, there's
a lot of folks that are taking that situation and spending their time, this young man started
this work back during the beginning stages of the pandemic.
And I got to speak with this teacher and they just said, you know, music is one of those
great equalizers.
We all love it, we all got our own vocation with it, we all have our preference.
But while we're down here, he said, I know you don't make music, but I sure hope that
that you guys, just like the person before said,
we'll focus on people.
And let's just make sure that this is a body
that doesn't create dissonance.
And with that, I yield the well,
and I appreciate the time.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes representative Yasmin Neal
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
and thank you to the House colleagues.
On this first day of Black History Month,
I would like to honor Shirley Chisholm.
Like a true trailblazer,
she was the first African-American woman elected
to US Congress and the first African-American woman
to run for President of the United States
under a majority party ticket.
Although her campaign was unsuccessful,
she became a legend and a beacon of inspiration for women
and girls of all races across the world
for generations to come.
She always remained unbought and unbossed.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the will.
The clerk will read the caption
