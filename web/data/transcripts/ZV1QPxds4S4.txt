House 429, I represent Wilkerson in the 38th and others to be entitled to amend Part 2 of Article 10 of Chapter 5 of Title 48. The official go to George Antony relayed an advalorant taxation of motor vehicles, so it was to exempt from advalorant taxation motor vehicles owned by a natural person for which Attata was issued in the state before March 1, 2013. This bill ever heard the committee on ways and means that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Wilkerson is recognized to present House Bill 429. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I bring to you House Bill 429. If those that were back here back in 2012, remember we eliminated the birthday tax for all cars. That's the annual tax you pay on cars from 2013 going forward. I received a call from a constituent over the summer asking why she still had to pay taxes on her 2010 car. And I said that's a great question because she has been paying taxes since then. What this bill does, it eliminates the birthday tax or annual advalorant tax for all cars now. Anything prior to 2013 that is currently being taxed will no longer be taxed. And so if you have an old car, you can go home and tell folks that you you no longer have to pay that tax. You'll be treated the same as someone that has a brand new one. And with that, I will yield to any questions. Representative Ramon, up the center, I'll on your left, just recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is Jim and yield. I do. Just want to say thank you for this bill. And would you not say that a bill like this could go a long way for those that have older vehicles, make them more affordable and make it easier for them to maintain them over time? That is the plan. Yes. Saving people money is always a good thing. Always a good thing. Gentlemen, has there further questions? Thank you. And I ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as you were the well, is any objection to the previous question to be in order? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

This bill, the evidence that the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 618, 618? House Bill 618, by the represent of Campbell, 171, to be entitled to amend Title 44 of the Fischkota, Georgia, annotated relating to property, so as to require any seller real property in the state to make certain disclosures regarding flood damages such as real property. This bill, I'm sure, the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The represent of Joe Campbell is recognized to present the bill, represent Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm presenting HB618 tonight. This bill is about requiring any seller of real property to make certain disclosures regarding flood damage and the history of the property as it relates to flood damage. Where we are today in this, a renter can have access to flood damage history. You know, I asked for the law, but a buyer cannot. And that in essence is what this bill is about, putting the buyer in the renter on the same level. In Georgia renters already have the right to flood disclosure. Georgia law requires landlords to reveal a property flooding history. Georgia home buyers deserve the same right. HB618 would amend Georgia law to require disclosure of flood history. And that's what the bill is about. The bill is about. It's simple bill, as they say. And so that's it. And I hope it up for questions or whatever. Well, representative, you did a good job. You don't have any questions. You're the well. I'm talking about. I go ahead, Representative Campbell. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I bring you House bill 291, the Community Health Care Worker Certification Act. This is a very vital bill for us. It's going to help our underserved and rural areas. This is basically to create a pathway to certification for community health workers. It's going to be overseen by the Department of Public Health. These will be workers coming from your own local communities. They'll be following the orders that doctors have. The clinics and doctors can have follow-up with their patients. It's going to be very beneficial for maternal care and even our mental health. I think childcare and the elder will also see a great benefit from these. I've had many, many people that want this. Right now, there's a very loose organization of how they're being trained. We have various hospitals that are doing the training in-house. And we need to have a consistent needing to know exactly how everybody's trained the same way. And that's what this bill will do. Are there any questions? Lady has no questions. Thank you. I appreciate your favorable consideration. Ladies, yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the Committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no? And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of House Bill 291, the yeas are 169, the nays are four. This bill has received the requisite Constitution majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 87, 87? House Bill 87, my representative Clark, the 100th and others to be entitled. And act to amend title 33, the fiscal to Georgia, and it's actually related to insurance. We are health benefit policy coverage for medically necessary, orthotic devices and prosthetic devices and their materials and components. This bill has referred to the Committee on Health, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Clark has recognized to present House Bill 87, the gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I stand before you today to ask for your support of House Bill 87, a bill that would change lives for Georgians with limb loss or limb difference. This bill isn't about growing government, it's about helping people. It makes sure folks get the medical devices they need to live full, independent lives. Right now state regulated insurance plans denied coverage for basic needs and that's just not right. Showering, using the bathroom, playing, exercising, these aren't extras, they're everyday things we all do. But for many, insurance rules make them out of reach. Think back to January 28th when we met some amazing people. Elliott, my six-year-old buddy, lost his legs a baby, his parents don't want special treatment, they just want him to have a normal childhood. To play with his twin brother Hudson, his older brother Sebastian, to one day live on his own. Jared Wallace and Athens Paralympian, go dogs. He has shown us that physical challenges don't have to hold you back, but still his insurance won't cover a shower leg. Something so basic. Brad O'Malley, a small business owner from Tucker, he needs special orthotics to keep working to provide for his family, but insurance won't be a good deal. This bill fixes that because the right medical equipment isn't a luxury, it's a need. We all know staying active keeps you healthy. When a doctor says someone needs a second prosthetic or orthotic, it's not extra, it's preventing bigger problems down the road. Even the Georgia Association of Health Plans agrees these devices are needed not optional. At the heart of this bill, it's people. It's about helping families, letting kids be kids, and making sure folks take care of themselves. Let's be real, this could happen to any of us. None of us are safe from an accident and illness or a condition that might require these devices. If that day comes, would you want your spouse, your child, or your loved ones to be told they can't have what they need to just shower or walk? That's what we're deciding today. Will we let insurance companies keep saying no to basic needs or will we do what's right for everyone? I urge you to vote yes on House Bill 87 because today we can make a real difference, not just for Elliot, Jared, and Brad, but for every Georgia who deserves to live a full life. Without taking any questions, and we'd love you to support of House Bill 87. I represent the school field to your right out front. Is recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? No, I don't remember, do. Is it not true that we both are excited at the work that we've done with advocates such as so everybody can move and how it's changed our lives? It's changed both our lives and it's left a huge impact on me. I can't wait to vote yes on this bill. Thank you. Gentlemen, House and further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just asked for your favorable consideration for House Bill 87. Thank you. I'm going to have that chance to vote for it right now. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

So we have a situation in the City of Stonecress where a solid waste company was given a permit by the city who did not have the jurisdiction. The county did because it was a new city. So what I need to understand, will this bill prevent a situation like that or are we given more power to EPD? Because EPD at the time knew that the city did not have the jurisdiction but authorized to permit anyway. Yes, this is a clarifies that. Thank you for the question. And that question came up two times in committee and subcommittee and full committee. And the answer is this clarifies that situation where it does not happen again. Well, thank you. I believe the folk in the City of Stonecress will be happy to know that. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen, has a question to you right. Representative Jason Ridley. I recognize for a question. Thank you. This gentleman you'd probably shouldn't. But I will. Well, this is actually a serious one. Is it not true that I had a call from numerous counties that was in support of this bill because they declared clarification on what the county can't do and this bill is going to do that? It will.

House Bill 677 by Representative Dempsey, the 13th and others being titled next to a man chapter one of Title 31 of the physical to George Annotated, relating to General Prussens for health. So it's a reward for certain placement procedures for children upon discharge from a hospital or psychiatric residential treatment facility in certain circumstances. This bill I've referred the committee on health, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The lady from Rome representative Dempsey is recognized to present the bill, Representative Katie Dempsey. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HB 677 seeks to create a process to address the growing problem in Georgia and around the country where children with mental health issues languish in hospitals. Sometimes for months and at times even over a year after they have been medically discharged. Acute or long term mental health hospitals, at that point too often parents and guardians and custodians are abandoning these children for a plethora of reasons. These are some of our hardest children. When we talk about hotel, when we talk about children that are hard to find placements, this is who we're talking about parents at the end of their rope. And they just don't know what to do. So they are in the hospital. They've had their three to five days of crisis care. And there's nowhere to send them. So this bill.

We'll pull together a quick strike team of decision makers to help these children find appropriate placement and services. The team will consist of the treating psychiatrist, the hospital's medical director, appropriate state agencies, a care coordinator, and any insurer responsible managing the care of the patient. But also one of the most important things it will do is collect data on the number of kids that languish in our mental health facilities and the number of days until they are appropriately placed. This will help us and it will be provided on an annual basis to the House and Senate budget chairs. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. If there are any questions, I'll be glad to take them. Lady has no questions. Thank you. I yield the well and ask for your favorable support to help our children. Lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

The second go to the committee is recognized to present House Bill 567. Thank you Mr. Speaker and members HB 567 will authorize and regulate the practice of teledentistry in Georgia by Georgia licensed oral health care team members through the Georgia board of dentistry to ensure that patient safety remains the priority while maintaining a continuum. The second go to the committee is the legal health care team that is maintaining a continuous standard of care and sustaining the Georgia licensed dentist as the leader of the health care team. It allows patients without a dental home to establish care with the provider. It addresses the huge concern we have of a lack of dentists in certain parts of our state. The first go to the committee is recognized to provide a specific function under general supervision for a real time diagnosis. Now there is no doubt that dentistry is a tactile practice so this does not allow for someone to go through teledentistry and do a lot in your mouth. It does begin the practice, the oversight and the view to help decisions be made about someone's oral care that might prevent an ambulance ride if they are in a nursing home, if they are in assisted living that can be very hard to. So this is a good way to help increase the number of healthy melts in our state. If there are any questions Mr. Speaker I will be glad to take them if not I will yield the well. Ladies and gentlemen, she has no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable support. Ladies and gentlemen, is there any objections to the previous question being ordered?

This bill, Henry C. the requisite, cost of some majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of House Bill 582? 582. House Bill 582 by the rep. Gunner D. A to be entitled. Nack to amend. 1617 and 24 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tettler relating to crimes and offenses. Criminal procedure and evidence respectively. So it's to provide for defendants to support and justification defense by offering evidence of family violence. Dating violence for child abuse committed by the alleged victim. This bill haven't further the committee on judiciary non-civilized committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Stan Gunner has recognized to present the bill. Mr. Chairman, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 582 helps victims of domestic violence who have committed a crime present evidence of their abuse as a justification for the crime which is before trial. In mitigation, which is after trial before sentencing. And those who are serving as sentence who have a history of being a victim of domestic violence. For justification, the defendant shall offer relevant evidence that the abusers subject to the defendant to the acts of family violence, dating violence or child abuse. Which is like a self-defense that can result in the dismissal of the case. For mitigation, the defendant may present evidence that he or she were subjected to acts of family violence, dating violence or child abuse. And that such acts were a significant contributing factor to the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. The bill sets out the evidence that is admissible and defendants that are serving a crime, serving a sentence may petition the court requesting to be recensed as set out for mitigation. There is a presumption in favor of granting a hearing unless the court determines otherwise. The hearing must be scheduled not more than 90 days from the date of the filing of the petition and the state shall be given notice and an opportunity to respond. There is a portion of this that crime survivors regularly report needing a diverse set of tools to address and repair harm. Enabling victim-centered programs will respond to this need while helping survivors heal. The victory privilege will allow acknowledgment of wrongdoing from the defendant, open dialogue and accountability, all of which are core to victim-centered programs. I think some of you have been receiving contacts from your district attorney, objecting to this. At the committee, there was a district attorney that did object to a portion of this bill and the committee voted the bill out unanimously with no change. The way I look at this, and it's the third section of the bill where they're serving time for a crime they've committed, this bill will not give them a free card to get out of jail. This is just a way to get it reduced. Their objection is the preparation and stuff they have to do for that. I understand that. I don't know if they know it, but I've offered to make any changes to it when it gets to the Senate. I understand the politics of this, but I really do not like the last minute objection. I can understand it on a sunny day, but on a crossover I don't. If you all have any questions, I'm happy to answer. Gentlemen, has a question representing Santos to your right about halfway back. So, gentlemen, yield. As a survivor, I would like to thank you for bringing this bill. I wanted to ask you, is it not true that this bill ensures that the legal system better acknowledges and experiences that domestic violence survivors and provides them with more avenues for justice and healing? Thank you, Will said. Gentlemen, ask them further questions. I yield the well. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 577-577? House Bill 577 by Representative Gaines of the 120th and others to be entitled to an act to amend Title 4080, the Fisher go to Georgia and it's added to relate to the bill. The Georgia and it's added relating to revenue and taxation. So it's done act the Georgia nicotine vapor product directory act. This bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Ways and Means, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Houston Gaines has recognized to present the bill House Bill 577. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 577, it follows up a similar legislation that we passed last year in the House. We didn't quite get over the finish line of the Senate to try to get some enforcement on vaping in our state. Right now we have seen the vape market being flooded by illegal Chinese disposable vape products that are really all over the shelves in our state and across the country. The reality is the FDA is trying to put in some restrictions but it's failed to do its part in terms of enforcement. Last couple of years the number top couple selling vape products in America including Elfbar which is one example. I think it was the number one selling product last year. It's actually an illegal Chinese manufactured vape and yet it's on shelves across the state. We really have no idea what's in these products, nobody's monitoring them and actually in some of the testing that I've seen, they're mislabeled in terms of how much nicotine's in them, what all is in the product. The retailers don't even know currently under the current landscape whether what they're selling is legal or not. Instead what's happening is products coming straight from China and onto shelves. This bill will help address that issue by creating a state level registry of what products are legal to be sold in the United States including the products that the FDA has given full authorization to as well as products that were submitted in a timely fashion that are pending. This will make sure that those products that FDA has denied authorization or that were not submitted in a timely fashion would not be illegal, would not be eligible to be sold. They're currently not legal. Anyway this bill doesn't change what is legal and what is not legal, what it does do though is provide an enforcement mechanism. Other states have done similar and my hope is this bill will help us get a handle on this issue and stop these Chinese illicit products from targeting our children which is what they're designed to do. In fact I had someone drop off a vape just a moment ago that had a video game on the outside of the vape and it's clearly targeted towards kids. I think it was called some berry flavor. These are products that are clearly aimed towards our children and they're not legal and so my hope is this bill will help us get a hold of that. Ms. Speaker I'm happy to answer a question if there is one. Someone has a question to your right in the back representative Carpenter has recognized for a question. Is the gentleman you? I do. So could you talk me through the enforcement piece because I mean I'm with you this is an epidemic for our youth. I see it around you know I employ a lot of youth employees etc and everyone of them vape and they're vaping this stuff and who knows what's going to happen to them. So talk through the enforcement for me please. Sure so this would be through the Department of Revenue the Department of Revenue which already visits these facilities regularly for enforcement but there would be a state level registry that manufacturers would opt into it be a thousand dollars to put a product on the registry and then Department of Revenue when they're visiting. So I'm going to repeat it in this conversation how much of a challenge this is and certainly in our schools this is a major issue for our kids. Mr. Speaker representative heagly the minority leader has a question right in front of you all take her question I appreciate it. Ladies recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker does it gentleman you. I do. I just wanted to say isn't it true that we went all across the state and the number of principles telling us what this is doing to our children at schools was astounding and it is further true that we don't know what's in these products. That's right and we need to get a handle on them for the protection of our children. That's right I want to thank the leader and the representative Alan Powell Gary Raychard said I know Dale Washburn served on that study committee where we did go across the state here the importance of this issue and thank you. Mr. Speaker you'll the well and ask for by his favorable consideration. Thank you very much you are well thank you for bringing this bill.

That's correct there just this is this is really kind of taking it from a license or to registration and just streamlining the process.

It's not true that an individual can only sell so many cars from their own yard or their own themselves I'm on for a year whatever is that not true under law.

This bill aims for the committee on human relations and aging that committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative LeHood has recognized to speak to House Bill 645. Thank you, Speaker and thank you members. We've created a lot of new laws tonight. Well, House Bill 645 repeals one. And so what it does is helps us return to normalcy post pandemic and the long term care setting. Excuse me, when the pandemic was raging, we were testing for COVID for all new hires and new move ends. And this just repeals that to align better with today's CDC guidelines and best practices. There's still a robust infection control processes in place. And Mr. Speaker, if there's no questions, I can yield the well. But if there's a question, I'll take it. And gentlemen, has no questions. All right, thank you. Ask for your favorable consideration. There is a member who would like to speak who's opposed to the bill. Representative Lisa Campbell has recognized to speak to the bill. Rift and Campbell, if you can do it in five to seven minutes with that work, thank you very much. The ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues tonight, I rise to speak against House Bill 645, which does repeal the testing of staff members and long term care facilities for COVID-19. I believe this is an unnecessary change that offers little benefit and much risk to the health and well-being of George's long term care facility residents. COVID-19 has devastated patients and care homes since the start of the pandemic. And while we might want to believe that the pandemic and COVID-19 no longer exists, that's just simply not true. It continues to be a highly communicable virus that still leads to illness and death. In fact, this last week, 515 people died from COVID-19. COVID-19 continues to circulate in nursing homes, even as data collection is further reduced. My colleague did mention the CDC and the CDC has stopped collecting data on COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents and cases among healthcare staff. The last week of data collection was the week ending of September 29th of 2024. However, earlier trends indicated that COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities make up at least 23% of all COVID-19 deaths in the US. And yes, this share has decreased since the start of the pandemic when long-term care facility deaths were nearly half of all deaths nationally. This share has dropped over time for a number of reasons, including vaccination among residents and an increased emphasis on infection control procedures. Testing. Despite this drop as a share of total deaths, nursing homes have come to continue to experience dishproportionally high-case and death rates in the country. For lots of reasons, it's a highly transmissible virus, and obviously the nature of congregant care settings. But the end-of-date collection does not mean that these COVID-19 impacts have ended or even diminished. Looking at August and September combined of 2024, the rate of resident cases in nursing homes was 16% higher in 2024 than it was in 2023. The rate of staff cases was 11% higher and the rate of resident deaths was only 3% lower. Even after the pandemic tests, they're very simple to administer, they're very cheap to administer, they continue to be an important control against the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections by enabling identification of cases so that other protective measures may be taken. Respiratory disease outbreaks continue and residents will remain vulnerable to COVID-19. Yes, it has become an endemic, but we still have localized outbreaks occurring in this most vulnerable population. Further, in addition to the high vulnerability of these residents, the percentage of staff who are up to date with COVID vaccines in Georgia is extremely low. Per the CDC, only 4% of long-term care facility staff are vaccinated. So for all of these reasons, COVID-19 testing measures should stand as an effective tool to protect the health of our long-term care facility patients. Our moms, our dads, our sisters, our brothers, a simple test that could save suffering and save lives. It's cost-effective, it's convenient, and it's easy to administer. In fact, I took several this week because I wasn't feeling well to protect everyone in this room. And I think requiring our long-term care facilities to continue that for the protection of our family members is the right thing to do. It's an effective tool, we have it at our disposal, and we should continue to require to protect our community. I ask you to join me in voting no for this bill.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HV217 will extend the dual achievement pilot program with the technical college for an additional five years. It's set to expire next year, so we want to go ahead and continue for another five years. Dual achievement program is essentially for high school students who have withdrawn from school. It gives them another chance to go back and earn their high school diplomas, as well as a technical certificate. I'll yield for any questions. Lady has a question.

All we're doing here, we provide for an increase in the state's maximum author relation of capital outlay funding from 300 million to 175 million. This is for construction or modification of local education facilities. This will not take effect until 2027. Two reasons this has needed. This has not been increased since 2007. So the process has been dramatically since 2007. And then last year in 2024 we added pre-K to the FTE funding formula. That's why it's needed. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everybody's favor consideration. Staying for any questions if they already. The gentleman has no questions. Thank you. Chairman, do you know the well?

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring you guys House Bill 471. This bill emphasizes the importance of water safety education for children by implementing a video presented to new new mothers at the hospital prior to discharge at no cost to the state with the video bill. The bill is being prepared by the Department of Public Health in collaboration with every child of swim or foundation. We have met with the Georgia Hospital Association and they are supportive of this measure for our children. I please urge you to vote yes on this measure. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I yield a well. Thank you. It is any objections to the previous question being ordered. Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Yes, all those opposed. We will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. I have all members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 471, the yeas are 169, the nays are zero. This bill has to be requested. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you be decaptioned to House Bill 270270? House Bill 270 by rep. It reads the 99th and others to be entitled to amend our Assembly in Chapter 10 and Title 9 of the commission. Go to George Amitetti relating to continuances. So it is required for the continuances to stay of proceedings related to eviction of tenants in certain airports. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Reeves is recognized to present House Bill 270. Thank you, Speaker Burns. House colleagues, House Bill 270 is just limited to the method of service of evictions now. All of the airport issues were taken out in committees. This is a very straightforward bill. There was a court decision last year, the Menusco court decision and the court of appeals, that took a departure from about 100 years of process service. So in the past, either a private process server or the sheriff could serve the high number of evictions that we had, the court opinion said, unlike all of the other court cases, you couldn't have a private process server do it. This mirrors the same language and the rest of the code and allows private process servers to continue serving evictions just like every other case. We've responded to a court opinion in this and this will return the law to the custom for many, many years. You still have due process because the court has to appoint the process server. So this returns the law to the way it was before that court decision last year. If there are no questions, I yield the well with Mr. Speaker and request. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you. Gentlemen, is yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here he none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Now this bill now pass all in favor of passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. No, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? I want to pass it to House Bill 270. The yeas are a 1-72, the nays are a zero. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 266-266? House Bill 266 by representative of the Saints of the 180th to be entitled an act to amend. Article 2, chapter 7, the total 48, the fiscal to Georgia and annotated relating the imposition rate, computation, exemptions and credits for state income tax. So it's exempt from state income tax tax income received his personal compensation for full-time duty in the act of military service. This bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. We're up to these scenes is recognized to present House Bill 266. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There is a-this was a committee sub, so it's a little different than what is on the title of the bill, but House Bill 266 has sub by ways and means doubles the military retirement tax benefit from 17,500 to 35,000. It gives our military retired veterans the same benefit we give to all Georgia citizens who are above 65. We just allow that benefit as soon as they retire from the military to take effect. This bill is on the work of representative Petri who took on the base benefit several years ago as well as represented baller, who helped craft this initiative. Of course, representative Blackman who chaired the committee and representative baller. This is a clear benefit to the citizens, all Georgia citizens, as we know from multiple studies in Utah, Texas, and Arkansas that once they incentivize veterans through this tax benefit, more veterans moved into the state, more veterans stayed in the state, and it was a workforce benefit that adds supplemental income, tax income to our state by their secondary occupations, which the great majority of them will do after their military service. Mr. Speaker, if there's no questions, I'll yield. Gentlemen, has several questions. Representative Bonner, Chairman Bonner to your right is recognized for a question. Does gentlemen yield? I do. Is it not true that extending this benefit truly makes Georgia a military friendly state and will make us more competitive with our neighbors? As the gentleman said, and he knows the matter very well, this is a, my primary interest is the workforce benefit. We have a great amount of Kings Bay retirees that we lose, that we need to recruit for the industries that support our military bases all around this state. Great bill. Thank you for carrying it. I'll yield for one more question, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hefner, to your left, towards your back, is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that the average military retirement for enlisted personnel, e1 through e9, is roughly about $45 to $60,000 depending on their rank when they were in the military? I trust the gentleman, lady knows what she speaks. Is it also not true that both bills that we have passed in this chamber today concerning income tax would be a benefit to families in this earning? I agree with the gentleman, lady. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I'll yield. Gentlemen, as you were to the well, we do have a speaker on the bill. Representative Ballard has recognized to speak to the bill, and you have a maximum of five minutes. You think that's enough? Absolutely. I like that. Ladies, recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I want you to picture a retiree in your mind. And I bet you pictured somebody who was in their 60s or 70s. Well, in the civilian world, that is a retiree. But in the military world, a retiree can be 38 years old. A 38-year-old person that has several decades left to work in our state. 27 states have state income tax, but do not tax military retirement benefits at all. None of our immediate neighbors taxed military retirement benefits. This means we are losing our military retirees to other states. We're losing people with skilled talent and a work ethic second to none. People with leadership skills who are likely to be more likely to be entrepreneurs than other segments of our population. These are people who separate from the military and go to live, work, and play in other, more military-friendly states. I would ask you to help me reverse that trend. Fiscal notes show what we won't get in that tax money, but what the fiscal note doesn't show is the impact of 70,000 active duty and reserve men and women and their spouses and children who will stay here and work for another two to three decades. The hour is late, so I will leave the well in just a second, but I ask for your favorable consideration on this measure that is so important to our military communities and to our state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies, yield of the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shout out this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed? We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Yes. Have all members voted for what purpose is representative Reese Ries? Parliamentary Ingram, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the Columbus community is going to be extremely appreciative of this legislation that I am honored to have worked with representative ballot and so many others on initiatives like this to try to get this pass for our state and I fully support this bill. I know the gentleman cares about his community and knows what he speaks. We appreciate all this work on this legislation. Have all members now voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 266, the yeas are 171, the nays are zero. Mr. Bill Hattersey, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 529-529? House Bill 529.

by Representative Barrett of the 24th to be entitled back to amend, title 13 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's a related contract. So it's to provide consumers with the option of having service contracts that contain automatic renewal provisions terminate after the specified period rather than being subject to the automatic renewal provision. This bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill pass by rules committee sub. Representative Corder Barrett is recognized to present the bill. Representative Barrett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill is called the Georgia Online Automatic Renewal Transparency Act. The name kind of says it all. Everyone in this room has been shocked by an automatic renewal on a subscription they've gotten over. And oftentimes at a dramatically higher rate than they've had before. And virtually everyone in this room has been exasperated with the difficulty in getting out of these contracts and these subscriptions at times. The Georgia Online Automatic Renewal Transparency Act addresses some of the challenges with automatic renewals of subscriptions. This bill is working off of a bill passed by Vice Chairman Houston Gaines coincidentally two years ago today. That bill was passed overwhelmingly by the way two years ago. And I think he got an enormous standing ovation I remember it well. This bill is designed to protect consumers from really bad actors out there. It basically does one thing. When a consumer signs up for a subscription for a certain period of time like a year, they should have the option to have the subscription end at the end of the term. This eliminates the need for the consumer to have to remember to cancel the subscription in the future. If the consumer wants to set up for an automatic renewal, they can. But let's face it, when you go out and get a newspaper subscription for a year and someone offers you a rate of 80 bucks or 100 bucks, you say, okay, great, I'm going to get a newspaper subscription for a year. That doesn't mean I'm getting a subscription for a year and maybe I'll have it for a year after that and a year after that and maybe there'll be $500 next year. It means I'm signing up for a year for a price. This bill is a simple bill. It does one thing. It lets you essentially have the ability to opt in rather than having to opt out. This bill is supported by the Georgia Council in aging. It's going to help a lot of our senior citizens. It's a great bipartisan bill. I'm grateful to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle. He's supported it, especially in my seat mate representative. It's got a whole come over there and thank you very much. I appreciate your consideration. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen has a couple of questions. Representative Corbett to your right, extreme right. Back in the corner of the recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? For you sir, I certainly yield. Is it not true that I support your bill but I still have concerns that it does not go far enough because there's nothing in this bill that addresses the issue I have with my mother-in-law's daughter that ever month I have unauthorized charges on my credit card. I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole. Let's see if we can duplicate that. Reps have been known until your right is recognized for a question. Does the gentleman yield against my better judgment? Haven't we been besties and fraternity brothers for over 30 years? We certainly have. Haven't you been talking about this piece of legislation for over three years even when you are running for this august body? Yes sir. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes sir. When you pass this piece of legislation will you lead please let me take you out of your fish pole so you will not live in a fish pole anymore. I'm afraid that we're all living in a fish pole. Sorry. Gentlemen you have one more question. Representative Camp to your right. Yes sir. I certainly do. Does the gentleman yield? Yes for my esteemed colleague. Absolutely. Based on this bill and the information that you gave us in committee and today do you believe it is possible that I can eventually cancel my Uber EAT subscription that they seem not to be able to find but yet they find my credit card every month? I'm not sure today. I encourage someone to on my computer cancel my subscription for me and I had a best time watching him flail around for an hour trying to figure out how to do it. So no I can't guarantee but this bill will certainly bring much relief and it's a great incremental step in the right direction building on an excellent bill that was passed by vice chairman gains two years ago. Thank you for bringing the thank you ma'am and with that Mr. Speaker I yield the well. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on the rules? Here in none the Rules Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed, all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, we lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 529, the yeas are 169, the nays are two. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. For what purpose is represented black man rise? Make a motion. State your motion. I move that House Bill 341 be recommitted to the ways of means committee. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 341 by Representative Newton of the 127th and others to be entitled to enact the two. Chapter 7 to the top of 48. The bill is in the position to create competition exemptions of credit for income taxes. On the general's motion, the House bill 341 be recommitted to ways of means committee is the objection. It is so ordered. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 397? House Bill 397 by Representative Fleming of the 114th and others to be entitled to enact the two. Chapter 2, title 21. I think this goes to George Anantay to relay the elections in primaries. Generally, so is to allow municipalities to opt in to providing advance voting on Saturdays from municipal elections. This bill haven't referred to the committee on governmental affairs. The committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative Fleming is recognized to present the bill. Representative Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. House Bill 397 is fairly simple with the rules substitute. What this bill does is it deals with the election and removal of state election board members. Currently the legislature, when we are in session, we can elect our appointees from each of the state elections board. We can also remove our appointees to the state elections board. When we are not in session, the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House have the authority to appoint representatives to the state elections board. What this does in a mirror is the authority we have when we are in session to remove and allow the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House to also remove a member when we are not in session. Mr. Speaker, that is what the bill does and if there's no questions, I'll yield the bill. The gentleman has a question, Ripley out in Sanya is recognized for a question to your left. Does the gentleman you? Yes, sir. So the bill in its current form does prohibit the Saturday voting for municipal elections. You should have the sub on your desk. Thank you. The gentleman has no further questions. Thank you. That's for your favorable consideration. You're the well. Is there any objection? The gentleman is yielded the well. Any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute, hearing none of the committee's substitutes withdrawn, is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the Committee On rules, hearing none of the rules, committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to a Green to the Report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? the committee has agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members now voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? The whole passage of House Bill 397, the yeas are 159. The nays are 13. This bill, haven't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 328? House Bill 328 by represent Carpenter IV. And others being titled an act to amend our two chapter seven, the title 48. The official go to Georgia and Tate of Relay and income tax and impositionary, computation, exemptions and credits. So is the increasing annual aggregate limit for tax credits available for certain contributions to students, scholarship organizations. This bill then includes the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Carpenter is recognized to present House Bill 328. Chairman Carpenter. Thank you, Speaker. Basically, this bill does four things to strengthen the QE tax credit. The first thing it does is it increases the cap to $140 million. We know that over $240 million was subscribed on day one for this program. So it left a pro-ration amount of 53%. The additional 20 million will help as the program continues to grow. This bill also seeks to allow insurance companies to participate at a higher rate, but a smaller percentage of their profits. It clarifies, I'm sorry, it clarifies as this cannot be rolled over and to next year, into the next year. And it also allows you to get another buy at the Apple in July if the tax credits are not fully funded at 95%. I appreciate everybody's help on this legislation. Just a friendly reminder, this tax credit saves the state about $1,500 of the student as the average scholarships are $1,500 less than what we do, what we currently fund public education. And also 46% of the scholarships are used for minorities. And the average income is a family income is $31,000. It probably guys take any questions. Representative Carson, the Senator Allen's recognize for a question. Mr. General, thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true that I had some initial concerns, but those have been, we've worked through it. We've agreed to work on this bill as it continues to the process. And this overall strengthens the program for Georgia taxpayers. Is it not true? That's correct, Chairman. Thank you for your work on this. This has been an issue that's been near and dear to your heart. I appreciate your allowing me to help work on it as well. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Thank you. I appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is yielded the well. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? What's on it? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report of the committee's agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed. Will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 328, the yeas are 98, the nays are 75. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. I don't know about y'all, this is one I've been looking for. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption of House Resolution 128? House resolution 128, I represent a demissive 13th and others, resolution compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins. This resolution haven't been submitted to the committee on appropriations. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by rules committee substitute. Remember, as we will go through the process here in just a moment from a structural standpoint, the sub you're looking at is LC, it's the second one you receive is LC60101295. Excuse me, that's an S. These young people can't write, and she's tired too. Maybe my eyes are tired. I can see it was the S all the time. I'm sorry, maybe it's my eyes. LC6010129S. That's the LC with that representative Dempsey will be speaking to. The ladies recognize to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the one I've been looking forward to tonight too. I know it's a measure that probably everyone here wishes we were not voting on though. And I want to respectfully ask you to help me do this though. HR 128 represents five compensation resolutions that representative Evans, representative Crawford, and I have worked on. They represent five unique individuals, each who lost years of their life due to wrongful convictions and incarceration. They represent four individual resolutions that have passed out of this house already. There is one other who is a co-defendant in a case that previously passed out of this house. We've done this before. It is no doubt painful. Each of these men were denied their opportunity to an education, to build a career, relationships and family, time to seek a financial future for themselves and their loved ones. Compensation will not buy back those opportunities or those years, but it will help them move forward. And it is the least we can do. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be innocent and to be locked away and to lose all of that time. These five men are not just exonerated. They were found to be innocent. They are sad. It is a tragedy. And today it is our responsibility to take care of this. I ask the hour is late. I would rather not yield for questions. I will if I must, but I ask for your respectful consideration of this that we move it on and try once again over in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady had no question. She yields the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Okay, here is where we got to get this just right. Is there objection to withdrawing rules committee sub LC60127S? Here in the chair here is none and the rules committee substitute is withdrawn. Now is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? LC60129S. Here in none the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Here in none the report of the committee is agreed to. Now this resolution now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution, will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Thank you, time. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the adoption of House resolution 128? The A's are 151. The NAZR-12, the resolution have received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, I have a request for your approval.
