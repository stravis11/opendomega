you you you you you you you you you you you you you I I'm Senator Dunzalo-Jane and this is an official Urban Affairs Committee meeting of the State Senate. Before I begin, I'd like to ask one of our members to lead us in prayer and then we'll have introductions of those who are on the podium. Senator Dr. Michael Witt. Thank you very much. Everybody bow their head and close one eye. Oh, Lord, we thank you for this opportunity to come together and work towards our goal in terms of housing for people in our communities. You know, housing is the backbone of family and when you have family together intact on the one roof, it makes a big difference moving down the road. So give us the wisdom, Lord, to work through our issues here and give us your blessing to Christ our Lord. Amen. Amen. And since you have the mic, we've got one for you. Senator Rett, R-H-E-T-T from Cobb County, Georgia, been in the legislature now for about nine years, retired Air Force, retired educator and here to help you. Thank you. Thank you. That's Cobb County, y'all. Yes. You're an abu-a-tender, she's my wife, her net-com. One of the best counted metric under I have to be biased anyway. I represent a fit district in Guneb, part of Lawrenceville, Lilleburn, North Coast, Tucker, Duluth and one of the most diverse states in the district in the country as a matter of fact, I have people from more than 100 different countries speak 100 different languages and I'd like to thanks our chairwoman, Senator Danzala James for taking the taking up this important issues in housing crisis. It's not only in Metro Atlanta or Stereo-Georgia, it's a national problem. There are a lot of things going on that we know that is very important to us, you know, friends and family and neighbor of our constructions, constituents, all are suffering because of the housing crisis that we have and we need to do a better job and see what we can do in terms of, you know, we leave that we can provide. That's why we here, I believe. Thank you very much and thank you for your participating. Thank you. And I'd like for our legislative council starting at this end to say a low one, give your name and any other information you'd like to get. Okay, number 15. Yes. Hi, I'm Christy Farhudi, I'm deputy legislative council. I drafted some of the bills that we might be discussing today. Thank you. Hello, I'm Holly Carter. I am the staff council for this committee. My name is Holly Carter and I'm also deputy legislative council with the office of legislative council. Excellent. Thank you and Diego. Hi, Diego Santana, I'm Senator James's legislative assistant. Thank you. And research. I call you master. Oh man, he gives us all the information. My name is Nathan Corbett and I'm with the Senate Research Office. It's a pleasure to be here today. Thank you and we have a state representative. Number four. I'm state representative. I'm state representative. I'm from the 65th district. I serve as the full 10 Douglas and Calvita County. Thank you, Senator, for having this committee today. You're welcome. I also want to take the opportunity to represent representative recognize representative Billy Mitchell. Who's in the audience. He's also the former chair of the National Legislative Black Caucus and he did a fine job as that leader. We think all of you for being here. We also have our media. Which number? I'm Sam White from Senate Press. I'm in charge of the zoom and the stream and everything and excited to be here. So thank you. You're welcome. And we also have online with us. One of our members. Senator Amanda will Jones, are you there? I don't know how to unmute this. I'm going to ask you a question. He is with us and could not. If he chimes in later. And ask questions, then you'll hear from him. But that's Senator Emmanuel Jones. He has Henry County, some of the Cal County. And he's a great leader in the state Senate. Also, we have. Do we have our mayor from. He wants to speak when he comes, but he hasn't arrived yet. And he has to leave right back out. So we'll squeeze him in off of the list. If you don't mind. Also, we have. Dory Henry, who is my chief of staff. And we have. My eight. Where are you? Elena Jones. In the back. There she is. I'm going to get started now. Yes. I'm about to. Oh, he's online. Very good. We have our Georgia legislative, like hawkers chairman, who is in Savannah now. That's why many people could not get here there. In other cities and couldn't make it today. I'm going to get to the point where I'm going to. I'm going to get to the point where I'm going to. But, uh, Mr. Chair. We say hello and introduce yourself. Good afternoon. Good. My great senator. And friend and as well as the chair of the Senate, urban affairs committee. And to members of the Senate, urban. Affairs committee, this distinguished body. I'm related to greet you on behalf of the Georgia legislative committee. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. And I commend you for holding this hearing on today. As the supply of affordable housing units. Is at an extreme low in Georgia. In the wake of the pandemic. Leading to higher. Race of rent. And greater homelessness among. Single adults and families. Madam chair. One of the things we can. Working with the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. They have 10 Teachers from. Now is getting start in the wilderness. The Pride continue right, I'm getting someревisions here as own. A large classes of horses that were affordable housing. with the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and the City of Savannah. And I'm happy to report that under my tenure of the last six years, we've got 252 people into moving from renting houses to owning houses. And so there's a housing crisis in Georgia. People cannot afford to pay the astronomical rent fees. The song used to say a house, a home, a house is not a home. They cannot afford to have a home when they cannot afford to pay for the rent for the house. And so this hearing is essential, even as we have HOAs and charge astronomical fees and do not provide the services. So we're facing a tremendous dilemma and I'm prayerful and hopeful that this committee will provide the opportunity for Georgia's to voice their opinions and to support viable legislation that you have on the table. We commend you for this much needed hearing and the Georgia legislative caucus is fully supportive of moving Georgia forward to make housing a reality for those citizens in Georgia. Thank you for the opportunity Madam Chair. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And we appreciate you taking time to be on this line and wish you could be here in person because I'm sure that those who did come today would like to speak with you in person. So maybe we can have another hearing before the session starts in January to give them that opportunity. Thank you and I do have a message from, thank you very much. And I have a message from Senator Immanuel Jones for some reason he cannot get in on Zoom. So he is watching us on the stream and he will continue to be here and try to ask questions by way of ticks. So we're going to get started with, first of all, we have three important bills. Senate Bill 125, which puts restrictions on rent regulations by local government. Senate Bill 29, the Property Owners Association, Certificates of Good Standing for Payment of Annual Assessments, and SR 37 HOA, the Senate Property Owners Association and Home Owners Association, Condominium Association's Committee. And SR 250, which will be the Hospital Authority Bill that many of you already heard about. And you know we have a shortage. Unallude, many of our hospitals and close all over the state right here in metropolitan Atlanta. We have two major hospitals that close within the last year, less than a year. And we are talking to East Point and the city of South Fulton and other cities about forming a Hospital Authority. So this bill is going to talk about that. And we already have doctors who are not employed anymore in the hospital and have their own businesses, but they're ready to come back into the community and take care of us. Something is going on with this mic is cutting in and out. So I hope that you can hear me with my whoresiness because of the allergies out there. So thank you. The first thing I want to talk about though, is Senate Bill 125. It will repeal the Georgia Code and allow local governments to regulate their city's mental costs in the state of Georgia. As many of you know, we have a ban in the state of Georgia since the 70s on rent control. And we are attempting to lift that ban so that municipalities and counties can be able to take care of their own cities and work with their residents. And it's very important that we look at this to stop bulls rental leases and bills that are doubling and tripling and causing foreclosures or convictions. So we're going to make sure that we look at that. Now, I'm going to use this a problem throughout Georgia, but it's also throughout the nation. And without a cap placed on rent, cost skyrockets and causes many social issues in communities around the state and the nation. So most rent increase comes from companies out of the state of Georgia who own rental properties in Georgia. While we cannot deal with every single rent issue in this legislation, this is a good start to combat this very important issue. As the cost of living increases, we're seeing more issues with individuals and families struggling to pay rent in both metro and rural areas. And consequently, many of those people cannot afford it anymore and have become homeless and staying in day hotels when they can afford to do that. Those with fixed incomes also struggle while rental costs have no fixed cap. So we want to look at lifting this band so that if cities and if municipalities want to put a band or a cap or something on rent, they'll be able to do it so that they can take care of their residents. And so the goal of the bill is to expand the ability for local governments to regulate winters who may try to price gouge tenants in our state. This is unacceptable, but it's happening all over. So this bill was referred to the Senate Committee on State and local government operations. Someone sent a text out saying that this bill died in the Senate this year and that we voted against it. That is not Senate bill 125 that has to do with rent control. It may have been a Senate bill 125 in the past that was voted on, but they're putting the bill up. So ignore that. This bill is alive and well. And in January, I hope with the support of others who are listening to this problem and who agree we will come back or we'll send letters to the other legislators so we can pass this legislation. Also Senate bill 29, the Property Owners Association, certificates of good standing for payments of annual assessments, we're looking at different ways to help HLA's. We have a problem with many people who are part of HLA's who are threatened to lose their homes and many have already lost their condominiums in homes. And this has been happening for far too long. So we need to make sure that HLA's protecting the citizens that live there and not abusing them and not stealing homes as people have sent me so many letters and said that it's happening. So we want to make sure that we have confronted this. We've had two or three of these last year about it. So in January, we introduced this legislation. So hopefully this year when January starts, we will begin again in this time, be successful in passing this legislation. We have many people who are signed up to speak today and this will be an official record that will be shared with other senators who will have to vote on these other house members. So we thank you for coming and want to speak and is the mayor here for moving city yet? Okay, well, he's not here yet. So we're going to get started with that too. Representatives and then we'll go to the list. Representative Thomas, will you yield to your leader of the house? Yeah. Okay, please. Chairman Mitchell, please come up and tell us why you're here today. And you will sit. Right here, please in the witness seat. And those who are on the list, you'll come up and everybody will have three minutes. But I can't give my chairman three minutes. Sure. Good. I might not get anything passed anymore. Good. No, no, we know that. Madam Chair, members of the committee, another guest is good to be here with you on this important issue. I want to applaud you for taking up this issue. I will say to you that here in the Atlanta metropolitan area, if not this entire state, this is an issue that we're going to have to come to terms with. As you know, Georgia is one of the fastest growing states in this nation. The reality is since 2010 and 2020, the last census, one million new people have moved to Georgia. And it is not deescalating. And so what we were faced with is we have developers who are developing property. We have the because of the demand on property, the ever escalating property values are really pricing so many folk out of their homes. One of my greatest interest is what we're doing to our seniors in this state. I will tell you, it was just talking to attorney, my family, before here, and she presented me with an article that was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, dealing with this very issue. We now have, because of the ever escalating property values, we now have seniors who are paying more for taxes than they paid for their mortgage. We are literally pricing senior citizens who generally speaking don't have an income that could sustain the ever increasing property tax values. So that is something that we're going to have to come to terms with rather quickly. One of the things that I'm talking with in the county of the cab, in which I serve, is we have a property tax freeze on your property. You can elect to freeze your taxes on your property value. So as long as you live in the house, you will not pay anymore on your, your millage as a result. However, 90% as many of you hung on there's no 90% of the taxes you pay are to school board taxes. And it is substantial. So I'm toying with the idea of placing a tax freeze even on school taxes. Now my school board members and superintendents, they get a little uneasy about that. And I must say I'm sympathetic to their argument because even if you don't have children in the school system, you want the schools to be the absolute best they can be with our good schools, the property values are higher, with our good school crime rates are lower. But we've got to find a way to really can address the needs of seniors. We don't want to have seniors citizens who are homeless. We don't want to have that owner. Now as for this notion of HRAs, Georgia is one of the few states in this nation to allow HRAs homeowner associations to literally free up the rules on property for the late homeowners association fees. Now I think that's the Cogniant law. I think the guys who put together our form of government in no way intended that should be the case. Now I don't have a problem with HRAs assessing penalties. I don't have a problem with HRAs, even in leasing leans. They certainly get their proceeds on the sale of the house. But to literally close on the police property because they are homeless association fees, I think it's bad legislation. I think we should join the overwhelming majority of states in this nation. We should do not allow that. Madam Chair, once again, I applaud you on the forgiveness great work. I think that long after our service is finished, if we can attack this homeless problem, if we can attack what we're doing to price people out of their homes, we will have done a good thing for the state and generations to come. Thank you so very much. Thank you very much. But let me tell you, once you get $2,000 worth of leans against you, that house can go up on the courthouse. Absolutely. And be sold from up under you. You can own the house and just owe HOA fees. And they can take your property. Absolutely. And it might not, $2,000 worth of leans, your house could be worth a half a million dollars a month. Right. It doesn't matter the cost of it. So we have to make some serious changes. It is only about eight states in the nation, which allow that. Correct. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Thank you. And Mr. Representative Mendezia, Tom. Oh. You got it. Thank you, Madam Chair, man. My, as a legislator, are we pretty much look at scenarios, real life scenarios of people of our constituents across the state of Georgia and data? And that's what our votes are namely voted on by the data and the real life scenarios. So I serve as three counties and six cities. What I'm looking at is each city individually and how the planning and zoning departments are working. I'm sorry. This is going in and out.

The planning and zoning departments are working towards this issue. For an example, I have a constituent in August. She's a senior 76 years old. Her rent was $800. When she went to renew her lease, her rent was $1800. This was this month. Where is she going to go? Where is she going to go? At 76 years old, retired disabled. And her rent has doubled and supersedes her social security benefits. Where is she going to go? So my commitment is to work with all six sets of those marrying councils and urging them to make decisions like Senate Bill 125. And providing them as much resources that I can bring to. And even with sponsorships, we're trying to encourage other entities to pull together as consortiums of nonprofits to help these seniors pay for their homes. The monies that we receive from COVID-19 through the ARPA monies will never see that again. That type of money did help out a lot of people, but we're coming out of the pandemic. And like I said, we may not see that type of money ever again in our lifetimes. So it's up to us as legislators to put forth legislation like this Senator. Thank you and to support it as much as we can. I know that our mayor Vince Williams from the city of Union City should be coming. And he's here now. OK, so I will think hello mayor. So I want to talk about that, but there is a development that is in Union City that is part of a solution. And I and I will you to him now, Senator. It's a subdivision. It's a rental subdivision, but but I'll let him speak more about it. I'm sure that's part of his agenda. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, mayor Vince Williams, we come up to the witness seat up there for a moment and share with us. Thank you so much for being here. Yes, and no, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share. This is such an important issue in all of our communities. You know, housing is the biggest issue outside of public safety that we deal with right now. You know, you have several issues that are extremely important access to health care is one. So we won't go there. But anyway, certainly the issue around rent control. I'm going to let you all handle that. But one of the things that we wanted to make sure is that we had developments coming to our community for housing, which would house many of those men and women and families who want to have a decent place to call home, but at a rent that they could afford. You know, this is a beautiful development. And we got families who have already moved in and we're looking forward to hopefully mimicking that not just in union city, but around the metro area. You know, when you think about men and women who work hard every day and they don't feel good about going to the place that they unfortunately have to call home and it's incumbent upon us as leaders to make sure that we fight our longest and hardest to make sure that these developers listen to what the local leaders are saying because we know what's best for our communities. And certainly representative was certainly correct when she talked about the historic opera funds. That is history. Now will it come back around probably not in our lifetime. However, we've got to make sure that we're doing the due diligence to make sure that we provide adequate housing for men and women. They are of all colors, folks. This is not a just black and brown communities. This is all of us. So we got to make sure that we're doing the right things, especially when we come to this beautiful gold dome because the men and women that elected you to get here and do the work. They elected the local leaders as well. So we want to make sure that we're working arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder to make sure that we're creating, you know, a future of stable housing. Yeah, we know we have a housing issue. We know that and it's not just in Georgia. It's around the world. Not just in the United States. It's around the world. I was in Israel in China. Everybody is grappling with this. So we got to make sure that we're doing the right things. And that's all I have to say. Thank you. Members, do you have any questions, comments to our mayor? No. Yes. Just the thing. Just the thing you back up. And I think that was very important that one word sustainable. Yes. We need to have sustainable housing that sustains our constituents. And I mean, it's just like the Fulton County jail right now. We are in the state of emergency. Well, I do want, you know, that is very important. You know, because it's easy for developers to come in and build crap and move on. But it's incumbent upon the local leaders to make sure that they're going back in. And I tell my folks always, we're no longer made bearer. So we're not allowing certain things that would be allowed 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago. We got to make sure that we go in and create the ordinances and the zoning that are needed. And the requirements of materials that these developers are using. So that these houses will be sustainable safe, but also something that people would be proud of. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. It's going to be a part of our record as we move forward and trying to resolve this issue. And Margie McLeod, are you in here? Okay, can you bring her? She put two people's names on here that I can't make out. Margie, who are the two people is Jody here and who is the high? Please come sit up in the witness seat, Jody. And where's the guy? What's his name? Mylin is not in. And and and the in oh, Mr. Washington, you know how to read. Yeah, he's going to make a statement next. And then we're going to we call him from this list that we have in front of us. And everybody will have three minutes. So if you can is better than to city hall. You can just show your your shirt and we know what you what you want. Okay, let's city hall give me two minutes. So glad that three minutes. I'm sorry, but the reason why we bought this for the Senate, Don's other Jane for Senate bill 125 for rent control. Because we need an isn't me and I don't have to go and talk when you walk. You see your city. You see how your city look. You see how much homelessness out there. People do cannot make three times the rent. That's where our problem is. And you remember wages, you all know what many wages is. So is we never could be able because people in the neighborhood. They don't 25,000 a year. Some of them don't make that. So rent is constantly going up. And I know I could talk, talk, talk. You see it out in the streets. People living in the cars. People sleeping on the street. Only thing I could say, let's don't be like California. California learned the hard way. Yes, guess what California did? They got rent control. What I'm saying, I keep saying, we could do this. Let's don't wait till they be sleeping out at your house. Because that's what happened to California. We know New York have it. The point is, this is Georgia, this is Atlanta. We want to be like New York. So let's do New York laws. We could do this. And it's sad that we have children, schools being closed because the children are moving out of neighborhood because they can't not fall the rent. You know, food prices going up. You remember a dozen of eggs, how much now? But it went down. A lot of people got put is our food stamps now. Medicaid, Medicare. So it's a cry out there. I want to take this show off. I want to take this show off. I'm not going to take it off. What I mean, that I want to be. I want it. We have rent control. I've stopped here. I can't do it. I can't do it. The students need it. It's not about the color. If you ain't green, you don't see it. If you don't have the money, we have and have not. We got to stop this. You say you love your city. If you love your city so much and you love your state, we put you in office. We keep telling us, I don't care. Your public Democrat is hurting everybody family. And especially the children and how you see the children's out in the street. And then guess what? Guess who's recruiting? You got more people is dripping than ever did before. I'm not, I'm not mad at them because they're doing things that they don't want to do because they kind of make rent. They're going to make rent. You got a lot of single mother's out here. Help them. We'll put in your three minutes. That's I'm sorry. But we appreciate you and all your efforts. Thank you. And before Jodie, before you speak and introduce yourself, we have another one of our members here, Senator Nikki Merritt from the ninth district, please introduce yourself. Which one is in that? You know, hear me? Good afternoon, everyone. I apologize. I am late. I was at an event as to say, the grandparents event and as you know, many of our grandparents today are a primary care giver. So we're happy for organizations like that. It's happy to be out and support them. So I am. I'm sorry, my partner, but my name is Senator Nikki Merritt. I represent the ninth district that is in on the east side of Rene County. And we're going through our conversations. Thank you. Thank you very much, Senator. And Jodie, we please and I call you Jodie because I know you your first name, but I that disrespect and you please go ahead and introduce yourself and tell us the things that you do and what you've been doing as far as rent control is concerned. Okay. Thank you for having us here, Don Zella. And I want to thank you so much for reaching out to help the people. I'm Jodie Williams. I'm with Miss Margie, I assist her. The name of her organization is number one next of Ken. My organization, my nonprofit is can you hear me? Yes. Oh, is maturing young women in men of Fulton and the cab County. There's a lot going on here with this rent out of control. My daughter is a college student. She has five roommates because they can't afford the rent. First she had two. And then when they're rent went up $500. Instead of moving, they ask they recruited people to move in with them. She's a student at Emory and she don't want to have to leave school, but she has to be close because she don't have housing on the campus. I want to speak about the elderly. The young lady, the senator spoke on grandmothers. Well, the city is moving our grandmothers out of these apartments. They're getting with these investors selling the property, the housing authorities, selling the property to investors and our elders are having to leave their homes and they have no place to go. Like Miss Margie spoke on the people, you see them when you go to the grocery stores, the people with all that stuff in their car. Feel too capacity. These are the people who can't afford their rent. I met a young man the other day, he was a firefighter and he was already paying 1,300 for rent and his rent increased $300 and he couldn't afford to pay it. So now he's living in his car. These people in these 10 cities, they don't want to leave Atlanta Atlanta is all that some of them know you can't move them out of the city. Because you're doing a new thing, gender vacation, you can't do that to them. They want to be here. This is their city. So I pray and I hope that this bill passes. Can you guys hear me? Can you still hear me? Okay. We need to do something about this. We need to come together and fight for the people. The people are who elect you all. If they all move out of the city, who's going to vote for you guys? So we need help. We need you guys to support this bill 125. Supported. I mean people tell me where I have property. I have property too, but I care about the people. When you care about the people, you don't want to raise things so high that they can't afford it. They can't afford to live in it. So please help the people. Help them. They need your help. We're begging you guys to help the people and vote for this bill because they can't afford to live anymore in this city. Help the people. Thank you for allowing me to speak. Thank you, Miss Williams. And you're right. You just like your own property. So do I. My late husband and I have 14 pieces of property that we were running, but we never gouge anyone. We never tried to put people out and foreclose on them and evict them unless they were not following the rules. And we get them plenty of time. So there are a lot of good landlords around. And this is not to punish anyone. This legislation is to make sure that we take care of the residents. So thank you. Would you like to introduce yourself? Yes, ma'am. Thank you for having me today. My name is David Washington and I'm a qualifying broker for Kiplin real estate consultants and advisors. I'm not here on necessarily on rent control. I wish there was something that could be done. I know that's largely pertaining to the economics. I specialize in foreclosures, I specialize in keeping people in their homes. And a lot of people become tenants as a result of losing their properties to foreclosure. And so I'm not sure what type of legislation could be put in place, but H O A's are foreclosant on homeowners at a record level at this point. The issue with H O A's and I've testified for a client, she's 91 years old. She never missed the payment. She owns seven properties over at Payton Village, never missed the payment on H O A somehow another they managed to foreclose on her for delinquent H O A dues. I went all the way back to 2016 as far as the banks will allow us to go and looked at every month. She never missed the payment, never was late. But somehow another she owed $33,000 on one unit, 16,000 on another, 12,000 on another. There's no statutory right of redemption on the mortgage foreclosures in Georgia and when H O A's choose to foreclose or if it's written in their covenants for them to be able to foreclose again, they're just all in a law. This Georgia is a creditor friendly state period. It is not designed to if life happens in a 30 year period of time that you finance and your mortgage something in life is going to happen. Somebody's going to get COVID a car accident, a divorce. I lost 13 properties when I was divorced and my wife. Thank goodness I did it strategically and my income wasn't that much effective, but you had a depth of a spouse. Life happens. There are some provisions with mortgage companies called loan modifications, called forbearance agreements, things that you can do with mortgages that do not exist with H O A's. If you owe $5,000 to H O A, they will foreclose on you. There is no statutory right of redemption. Someone is going to bid on your property and now they own your home just that quick. It is the whole process can be done in less than 90 days. And unfortunately, once that property goes to auction, someone probably will over bid on a property and a homeowner, previous homeowner will get the overage. But they're mortgage, they're home, they're placed, they raise their kids, everything has been lost. These are not vacuum cleaners that we sell in. These are people's homes and their lives. So what I would like to see is something in a provision where H O A's can have some requirements to help homeowners that's facing this element. People don't get up in the morning and choose not to pay their bills. Something happens for them not to be able to pay their bill or car accident, a death in a family. I lost my mother and when my mother, my mother died, it didn't affect me financially because I paid for her fuel and all that. But thank God I was one of those kind of kids to do that. But I was depressed for two years and didn't care about stuff. And at the end of the day, life happens. What requirements are there for H O A's to be accountable when they are foreclosing on people and there is nothing that the homeowner can do. Everything as far as the law, as far as the state of Georgia is in their favor. So I testified in behalf of this client, the judge had no, I mean, he had to follow the law. So the owner of the H O A, I'm sorry, the president of the H O end up buying this woman's six properties that went to foreclosure. I thought that was a serious conflict of interest. But because there's nothing in a law that says this is prohibited or he just took advantage and end up taking his lady's property. So I prayed that something could be done with this legislative body that can help homeowners that are facing these kind of issues. I know this is a much bigger picture than what you all are in control of, but what you can do. I would like for something to be done if it all possible. We are. Thank you very much. We are attempting to do that with this legislation. Since I'm horse, I won't talk much, but I'd like to get an appointment with you. And we sit down and talk because you're wealth of knowledge in this area. And we want to make sure that we're protecting everyone. Understand the land owners and the property owners, everyone. Yes, ma'am. And definitely those who are being foreclosed on and victim from their properties are either becoming homeless or in a day hotel. As long as they can afford to, but the bottom line is the rent keeps increasing. If they find a place to rent and many and the 91 year old woman that you were talking. I know three that were in their 90s and they had homes all these years have paid for them. They got behind on HOA only. They have paid their mortgages off completely and they were paying their taxes. But they lost, they ended up losing their properties. And that was another reason why I'm working aggressively to change these laws. So with your help and with the help of the experts in this area, we hope that we can bring a package to this legislature in January that will make sure that we start protecting the residents. Understand. So if we have any questions, Senator, how about? Thank you for the question. Thank you for that. Be here and speak to us and I'd like to, whenever you meet, I'd like to meet to make sure we understand what we've come from since you get all this experience dealing with these issues. And I think I have some issues with HOA too. So I think it's very important that I'll be part of this conversation for my education. Thank you. Thank you. Senator Merritt, did you want to ask any questions? If so, measure button, whatever. Thank you. The next person is that we just had Mr Washington. Who is this? Right here. I know that the first person that was in this hall with me for a whole hour was Mr Bolton. Mr Jerry Bolton. So your name somehow is on the last sheet, but I'm going to ask you to come up now. And I remember when we were talking about this issue on the radio the other day you called in. So please come and share with us and please everyone we have three minutes and we do have a timer. I promise you. Okay, stay within my time. Thank you. To Madam James, Chairman James and your constituents and your associates and to my fellow citizens. I greet you all today. I'm listening to what you're discussing and I thought definitely can attest to the fact that I am one of those persons who endure the 2008 real estate crisis. Okay, I did lose some property there and I thought I was you know on the up and up and new everything. But sometimes you can just miss those fine details that are attached to these tremendously misunderstood contracts and the clauses that are hidden in now that if you don't have a very good lawyer, you will miss. Okay, but bring it up to today. I am one of those persons who happen to fall into this current crisis of being a senior citizen. I was I was given a notice of non renewal by the person landlord I was renting on the had been in that particular establishment for about 15 years. And this happened to have been in Union City. Not the mayor's fault to fault mayor. Okay, this was a, this was an investor. And she came in she brought the property and said that I'm sorry sir, I understand you don't fixed income. And I don't think you will be able to afford my increase. I said, well, what is your increase? She increased the rent by not twice, not two times, but three times them. Now I'm falling on fixed income. Some of the companies that work for the pension doesn't kick in until I'm almost in my middle 70s. So, you know, even with that, it still will not be comparable to try to deal with what the prices are in real estate right now. Okay, I'm just saying that to say this. I feel for those who are like, and you see, I'm not out here just looking around. I'm in it. So I know what it actually feels like to have to live out your vehicle being a senior person. And it's very hard breaking to see senior citizens really to see anybody out here, you know, because if we have to deal with this thing, honestly, no one in America, no one in this country should be homeless. No one, the tremendous wealth that's here and you better believe you meet ladies and gentlemen. I don't know what your belief on. I'm not trying to take it to a religious thing, but you better believe somebody I'll see all of this. Okay, these are processes that are happening all over the world and not by coincidence and then not by conspiracy theory design. Okay, get with it. Whatever I can do, man, to help in this process, even if y'all need my big powerful voice, I don't need a microphone. To help in this process and to help speak out, I will do it. And I do thank you all so much for what you're doing and what you're attempting to do. And may you all be blessed in your endeavors and helping us in this crisis, because we do need rent control. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Mixed. Scary times. Karen Thomas. And we just might need your voice in January. So let's talk before the end of the conversation. Thank you very much. We definitely and I know you because you went to Mars round call. And you not that much of a senior citizen now, but we were over there together. So anyway, barely. All right, excuse me. So Miss Thomas. Thank you very much for being here. So the condominium association. That's correct. Good, good afternoon to everyone and thank you, Senator James for this opportunity. And to everyone good afternoon. I am here as I was listening to the realtor speak about HOAs and how detrimental it is for us to have oversight. I did review. I believe it's House Bill 303. Okay. And in going through the bill, what I'll say is the real three or was it you talking about the H.O. The former one for HOAs and PO HOK. Yes, okay. Several is several bills out here, but this we can talk about because we're talking about. I simply imagine some of these these bills. Yes, please. Okay, so speaking from experience, I too bought into homeowners community. I am from Client County, Georgia. I live in the city of moral. See of morals approximately. Seek thousands in population. And in buying into the kind of community, of course, the lender has requirements. That means that there has to be a certain amount of reserves and there has to be a certain amount of owner occupancy for you to get that loan. And over the years, I've only been there five years. And in five years time, I have learned that the system of intimacy between those who are supposed to protect us. Those who are supposed to ensure that maintenance is provided for us. And the association as a whole has taken their own way of systematically suppressing, oppressing the association until you just no longer have the with all wherewithal to even.

fight back. So we're at a stage where nobody is really wanted to fight back. And so hearing about the fight, I too ended up in a situation where thank God I knew about home modifications otherwise I too would have lost my property. The you can get a letter from an attorney regarding your water bill and your water bills $50 a hundred dollars. But they're going to charge you $50 for generating that letter. So now I got to pay for the letter you're sending me. And then I got to pay the water bill. It's not a big deal, but the process in itself causes other people financial hardships to keep them from ill afford, you know, to be able to afford their property. Now I did know to get a modification and because I got a modification, I was able to keep my property. I had to file a chapter 13. I'm 61 years old. I need to retire soon. So I thank God I versed myself on what to do to prepare myself for this end. However, we still have this situation and I believe the HOA P.O.A reform mentioned something about an ombudsman someone to look over watch over when the attorneys are no longer revered sending the HOA. They're working with the board. I shouldn't have to five years. Badger you just pressure watch our sidewalks. Pressure watch our fences repair offense fix our roads. I actually had to contact the county myself because the response I would get from the management company is going to be resistance. The board itself out of the four board members only one resides in our community. There was so you have board members who have nothing to do with your association. Not they're not members. They are. They don't reside there. Okay, they own property. They okay, not only do they own property, but somewhere along the way they took the liberty to purchase more property than the percentage allows us suppressing our votes. So we got board members who don't live in our county. You can't vote on our county can't vote in our city to bring change that way. And then you live in your community where you can affect change. However, you got the majority of unit ownership. That should not have been allowed. So those who don't live there who are board members, you got nine units. You got a person to own seven units. You got a person to own five units. That's 21 votes. So we need to affect change. And because we can't or we are learning that another issue is because of no oversight. This on budget would be great to keep up with the address information of some of these owners. So you do a property search. I shouldn't find an LLC that's hidden under an LLC that's hidden under an LLC and all three of them have different addresses or in and out of state. We got property owners who live in Virginia. I got P.O. boxes in Virginia, but you hold six votes. I could use those votes to make a change. And so with the presence of an on budget. We have someone to watch over those who should be watching over us. Yes, we. And instead, are taking their face. Your time is up. But you do like the busman. Yes, yes, right. Great. Definitely need an on busman. Okay, great. Then I guess for that. Okay, thank you. Wait before you leave. Senator, do you have any questions or comments? No. No, Senator. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Thomas for your comments. Mr. David goes on. And Jessica Navel is behind is after that. After all y'all together, you want to know you two different. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone. It was an attendance. I appreciate all of y'all coming by. And I'm so glad that Mr. Washington talked about what he did. I'm also going to talk about. House Bill 29. 37. I think it was viola Davis is 303. Yes. These are things that are essential. These are things that are essential. So my name is David Matthew Bazon. I'm a member of the city of homes. I'm a member of the city of homes. Okay. So what I wanted to speak about is we've been working. First of all, our partners for Mr. Raman. I would point you in the direction I love to speak to you. We've been working with our mentors. Patrick Johnson from Hurling, which is a national advocacy organization. For. Miss managed H.O.A.s. We've also been working with Miss Rhin, Rhin, Shafano, who runs H.O.A. Fight Club, as well as H.O.A. United. These are. It's a, it's a social investment. That is starting. Because it isn't an a grassroots level injustice that has put the power. My grandfather used to have a shirt that said power corrupts. But absolute power is kind of cool. And this is what happens because we have fertile grounds corrupt. We have fertile ground. I love that shirt. We have fertile grounds for people who are neighbors. who may or may not be legitimately elected into their positions of power and it is power, because they can reach into the most sacrosanct of American institutions, which is the American home. Okay. And they can take it away from you. So I wanted to mention, and excuse my notes, I promise you I'm not texting. No, you can share your notes with us if you would like at the end. I would like to. Okay. Because we're going to have a meeting afterwards and talk about it. We can do that. Thank you so much. So I wanted to mention so Florida, HB 919, I wanted to bring it because this is not just a Georgia issue. We, it was signed and I believe by the governor, I think it's going to be passed in on October 1st. I was checking it last night. And I'm glad that y'all are with the Vanguard or people are trying to make changes with Haways and their regulation. So this bill 919 was in response to the hammock's community. You may have seen in the news. They embezzled around $2 million by writing checks to Shell companies. So they have a vendor. They would write a check to the vendor and the vendor was themselves. And the sad part is is that with lack of regulation, this could happen in our state. I don't have the benefit of evidence, but I would be so bold to say that this does happen in our state, maybe not at the same level. So I just wanted to mention that. I want to quote Miss Catherine Fernandez rundled the Miami date state attorney. She says HB 919 reduces, reduces election fraud. It gives owners greater access to records. It outlaws kickbacks. We are recommending criminalizing fraudulent activity and associations, elections, shockingly fraudulent election activity and association elections, even blatant frauds are not crimes. So I'm glad that Miss Doncella James and everyone else is supporting these kinds of bills are working towards this. Especially the mandated mediation is a good solution. I think that it would be good to have a neutral party, if not a division that would be able to alleviate homeowners going against the house. Because when you play against the HUA, the house always wins. They have their own dedicated attorneys that they will tell you I do not represent individuals. I do not represent you. I represent the HUA. So those are what we wanted to bring forward. We need a regulatory body and the vacuum of lack of regulation of HUA's is exactly what my grandfather used to talk about. Because unfortunately, people are people. And if we don't have someone to keep them responsible, sometimes they become really irresponsible for clothes on your homes, leans, and all of these other consequences. So I appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Do we have any questions? No, no questions. I say you can contact my office and we can make an arrangement and sit down and go with detail. I would love that. And Ms. Dunseller, James, I would love to do a HUA boot camp with you at some point as well. That education is just essential, the way that you're working with Carell Driscoll and with HUA Alliance. It's awesome. Yes. And Douglas County, which is part of my district as well, has a great, very strong HUA boot camp. And so we've started them all around the state. And many of the elected officials of those cities or counties are the ones who are working with us. And that's hands on. And they're right there in that community, the local community. So yes. We're great education. Yes. So make sure you get with Diego and we work together on that. I look forward to working with you and addressing some of the concerns that you mentioned are not in this legislation. But as I mentioned in the beginning, we can address everything and erase everything right away. But we can start one at a time. And so we're looking at how to prioritize what we're pushing forth first. Thank you very much. I appreciate the steps you're taking. Thank you so much. Thank you, everyone. You're welcome. Ms. Jessica Navez. Hello, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for the opportunity. My name is Jessica Navez. I'm from Cawira County. And I live in the city of Holmes, Newna. I purchased a property back in 2018. We just learned about the NHAOA community when we were just signing the documentation at the close neither the re-eitor nor the attorneys, releases information unless I stopped the paper and I say, we'll explain to me what is an HOA. And he will just tune me in next-of-explanation. Of course, having my six months, baby, I couldn't retract from that moment. And I just signed it. It has been five years. Five years in the NHAOA in Cawira County. We have an HOA board president, an HOA board members that never that never could be a corporate meeting. We have a system of network that we have discovered for almost eight months of research. The developer for community can introduce in three key purchase of property, the property land. Then this developer, this company, then passed into a warehouse, the new sales network, which compiled through what is a real estate company. And then the same owners of the real estate companies have been able to move the houses and the same owners and the management companies. Right now, we are facing an HOA board recall, which was submitting an OVS tent. The 30 days, when a person under the rent-refect organization code has been released on Sunday against what? They have an online special meeting. They actually have been pressing this and then to report theirself, because there's no setting that isn't being for interest. And we're just that. We also know how the system works. She has a main office managerate board. We have the trains that are free without fees. We are the revenue product of foreign attorneys. And then we want to proceed through the recall because we don't have means, we don't have access to the real financial records. We don't have one's health and needed houses. But we know it most best of the big financial companies. But we know that our bank account and your business are all clean and you'll send business to work only the two decades. And then we will be willing to fund the recall. Now, the 72 homeowners who are selling the petition are happy to follow their own money. And the annual income for suggests that the same economy needs to be a court. And should we be back as soon as I've mentioned, it should be a dedicated department from the state that can take the country, the complaints and making closely with one's assessment. And closely, we are recognizing our maker authorities. I have personally contact our local authorities. And they said that there is nothing that they can do with the system's HOA. And I truly believe the main task is to work behind the same situation. Many of our my neighbors, I right now, the fellow Los Angeles properties, I have 10 homeowners, any of my neighbors, leaves for over $6,000. I wish one has a written middle settlement. He didn't know that his leaves are still active often paying with college in the Trinity department. And we just, the attorney who represent the territory is the same one that collects the money that plays the correction department. And just that is the same thing that we're closing in, and we can be strongly postponed. We're all disnatured later. And last time before the thing is here, this network is already in the federal superior court that's recorded for over $4 million. How is the double standard of companies that are in the need have any seven or federal lawsuits from the Sonanage community? How is that possible that these companies can handle the liability? I was going to mention that. I know that the very main California watch this and they learn to bring up values to all of those have a closer properties. From the new sub-properies and from those who are going to use the properties to bring those properties to them. Thank you so much. Thank you. Before you leave, hold on. One question. But what do they call the new sales? You said a network. It's called the new sales something. It's an area. So when the boom there comes and they purchase the land, they're really moving but it will be the management company, which is certainly a partnership that is unrelated to them. In our case, these are family members. In our case, this is just a change of network. I think specifically in the timeline and I can provide that record to you in some 400 fingers that I will draw today. And I will be glad to leave this on your desk today so that you're thinking investigate. Since we have the research representative here, I think it's the, I've been doing a research more than three years in my field. And I know how the treatment will lead the master piece of everything. So I would really like you to go over all this documentation because there's not just renters, homeowners who can become homeless. So management companies, builders, age old, but attorneys are completely in the same network. Yes, thank you. Any other questions? I want to ask the legislative council on the end. You said 72. 72 homeowners have signed the petition to remove the board and then the time has already passed. It was in September the 10th. We are right now September the 13th. They are, she's not going to recall herself. She has been in position as a president for more than two years and we have a very quick, single election that was disclosed in the annual meeting in February when the former secretary disclosed in front of the meeting that she was selected for the 25% of the board and from homeowners. And this is where we leave a legislation. Yes, and 72 out of how many? 118. The rest of the houses didn't sign as I remember how many mentioned because these belong to corporates and corporates normally they don't resign the community. Okay, we don't address this legislation. However, I wanted to know if legislative council can see if we can do another bill or add this to it. Because we need to see which one are you? Go ahead. No, you are correct that that is not addressed in the current bill, but it's something that we could add a requirement for. Thank you. I thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, any other questions? Okay, we'll, we'll, we'll, we have some people who are in on the committee that could not get in on the Zoom. So we might need to make sure we have a way to contact you because they might want to ask you a question. Absolutely. email or some way. Thank you very much. No, thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, we have Mr. Roberto Cadinas, right? Yes. As well as Alonzo Williams II, if they are start Alonzo, make your way for, you'll be next. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, and just, I'm sorry, my name is Dave Muzon. I'm sitting in again for the benefit of Mr. Cardinas for neighbors. But I, I am a CMI certified medical interpreter for this. It's not legal. It's not my specialty, but he's not going to be getting into legal terms. So I think mine should be sufficient, but he can have a more expressive voice in what he wants to express. So, okay. I will interpret it as he's saying it. Winter, most of the year. Okay. Hi. My name is Alonzo Rocadina. I live in the, you know, the, any very part way that, right? That's a new New Yorker. I, I own the house. You know, you know what happened because you know how the house, you know, how you have the pool. And then any people pass on the house, he put a ticket. You know, I don't know what happened because you know the car is parking outside. You know my property. I never have you know a car in this country because I live in, you know, the state. And then I explain, you know, how much is $4,000 for pay for ticket the car. I can't believe it. You know, I don't, I don't know, I don't understand because I don't have a car here. You know, all the time I have in my house, he's renting. I don't live here. You know what happened? I don't understand. All the time he put a ticket in my house for everything. You know, the last time he put a ticket, you don't know for a piece of the books. And the middle of the, the house. He put a ticket for everything. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Nothing. I don't know anything. Why? Hold on, please. One question. Yes. I just needed to clarify the context of what we're talking. I'm missing something here. Are we talking about the HOA is giving you ticket? You all your home. They're giving you citations for parking. You're going to find the car. Yes. Yes. Is it, you say it's not even your car? No. No. I never had it in my car. I would have been in the first ticket because the car is outside my property. And then he say my ticket, you're not my property. You know, I spend $4,000. You know. For ticket, the anybody, you know, I don't understand that. You know, I can't believe it. So the thing that happened, they would get tickets on my property. I don't understand why they gave me that ticket. Was this the police to get in the ticket? I've spoken about the situation with him. So the specific situation, and I repeat it for you, where did it go? That the H.O.A. enforcement, when there would be cars that didn't belong to Mr. Carvenas, that would be parked in front of his resident around his residence. They would give an H.O.A. citation, although the cars did not belong to him or anyone who was residing at that. They gave the citation around his residence, although they were not the owners of the cars. So they got to 4000. I paid 4000. So these tickets summed up to be more than $4,000 worth of tickets for cars that did not belong to Mr. Carvenas. I can't believe it now. Okay. Yes, go ahead. So let me make sure I understand this. They're giving you citations for cars parked in front of your home, and those cars are not yours. And they know the cars are not yours. They know the cars are not yours. So I told them I told them how they're here. Right. Because I don't leave it here. You know my properties for anybody. So they didn't do their due diligence to verify that the cars actually belong to Mr. Carvenas. They're just giving him the citation. I don't know who's cars. But the cars would be all around the block. Because they were in front of his house, they would give citations. They're just giving him the citations without any cars are there. They're just giving Mr. I tell you all the time. You don't know that I. That's not my car. That's the problem. Somebody parked in the car outside. They're my property. Why you put it. For me. I don't understand. And then I'll add that the citations in the Belmont Park neighborhood that were given for cars on the street on the February 1st annual meeting. Though it was clarified that in the CCNRs, the bylaws and covenants, the rules. There was actually not a stipulation for being able to give citations for cars on the street, because it's a public way. We're not a closed neighborhood. So they had gone to the extreme of creating stickers that look like similar to police, like a police sticker that they would put on your car. And they would put the management company, I believe, or the association's phone number and say, you know, you've received a citation. You need to call this number to resolve it. But it's really the H way. And it's almost superseding their powers more so than just giving H away fines. So could you say something else? You want to say anything else? No, I don't know. You're going to be able to do it. Because I was saying that they would give and they would give tickets for any reason. Well, again, legislative council. Is that legal, but they're doing it to them. They'll see that together. I was a terrible. The HOA residents to people who actually pay into the HOA have to get their own lawyers and all these fees. Because when I was listening to Mr David Washington. I talked about the late fees and everything that accumulated. That's added on to the amount in order to resolve, you know, where you get your name back. So they put that money for it. Things rather than for anything else. So they're going to end up. Are you going to be eating? Because you know, I need you all to speak. You got to go. Okay. Excuse me. I did. So he was mentioning yes, because there had been, as I said, some kind of church that would meet another house and that was because of those cars. So we've to your point, Ms. Dunzah, we have seen. In the cases that we've looked at in our neighborhood that there is from my understanding and legal counsel can probably weigh in on this. There is no limit as to what can be charged. There is no standard. We've had people who for lacking shutters have been charged $1,600. We've had just for sending the letter, they'll charge you $4 to send the letter. And then charge you the fines on top of that. And then with the fines, they'll add the letter amount that they charged you and the fine amounts they charged you onto what is essentially your principal. So it's compounding interest. It's interest on interest. Someone was talking biblically. Have you ever heard of usually. That's what I would call it. That's what I would call it. But there is no limit to how their. Fines are assessed outside of the covenants. But even then it's very loosely interpreted. So sometimes it gets handed over to the H.O.A. lawyers and. And it just comp it just goes on from there like. What said we know we have people who have $10,000, $11,000. Leans multiple. Well, they. Better. We better do something fast. Because at $2,000 worth of leans. The. H.O.A. has the option of selling your property from under you. That's the. And you know, and if you have a. And you know, I don't think that's the right thing. Now, are are are you away. The specific. Modality that they enjoy is garnishing wages. We have a lot of people. I would say at least a third or. Approaching half of the neighborhood. A lot of people who have leans. And they like to garnish wages. And I just, I did hear what you say it said that in order to purchase your home at the closing, they gave you this paper to sign to join HOA and you didn't even know what HOA was. So, you know, they don't tell you in advance. And then you're purchasing your dream home. So you think that's part of the qualifications to do it and get suckered. I mean, get no erase that word involved. But anyway, okay. And they don't have to notify you about the leans. We've had homeowners that we've looked on public record that didn't know about the leans that they had. And these are leans in thousands of dollars. There's no requirement for notification of leans or even foreclosures. There have been cases in other states where people were still paying their mortgage and their home had already been sold. Do you have some kind of arbitration? Do you have somebody you can go sit down and talk to before they put these leans on you? There is no requirement for that, man. They don't have, they're, I, I, well, legal counsel can probably weigh in on that because I want to speak in English. To my understanding, there's no requirement because that's the part of the bill, right? Is that you have to go to mediation to be able to? That's, that's why I was asking because we want to in the bill, we want to have some kind of way to mediate this and awesome, butzman to be over it. Somebody you can go and talk to and work with because right now in many condominiums, even, they even have a trailer association now because many people who live in trailers in a community are having even bigger problems. They take the whole trailer from them. This is the hardsters that I'm hearing since this legislation.

is introduced. So we are listening to you today. You know, we pay well past your three minutes. But you know, we let it go over a little bit since you had to interpret for him. We appreciate you coming and giving us this information. And it's not on deaf ears. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. The next person is Mr. Alonzo Williams, the second. Your mother coming up with you? Sure. Excuse me. Are you hearing me? Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for letting me speak. So I'm speaking more on bill 125. My mother is disabled and I'm her caretaker. My name is Alonzo Williams, the second. My mom is Nancy. And my situation doesn't deal with an H way. I just deal with landlords. And my landlord said that he was going to work with me to be able to purchase the home that I was currently renting from him. Then COVID happened. And he changed. And just like many people in Georgia as COVID-affected prices for rents, my landlord did something very similar to me. And my rent portion that I had to pay because I am with my mom has assistance to pay the home. It went up by more than twice the amount. My mom is on a fixed income. I work in education and I take care of her at the same time. And we struggled, mightily, but we were able to still pay the rent until I got a letter from him saying that he was evicting us. No reason, no rhyme, just I don't want you to be here anymore. When I asked what his, you know, we were on time with rent, we were doing what we were supposed to do. And he eventually said that I'm going to give the place to somebody else. Somebody else who is able to pay. And so that was my cue to say, so you're going to try and do this for more rent for which he would not respond. We almost, we are currently living in temporary housing because we could not afford the rent. And my housing authority was on the side of my landlord and not on the side of us. The institutions that we have in Georgia and all over the world are supposed to be able to help us when we need help. I'm a very hardworking person and my mom was a very hardworking person before she got disabled. We should not be the ones that have to be on the short side of a government that is supposed to help us. We want to be homeowners just like everybody else wants to be at some point, right? But if you can't help us just do the basics with rent because you feel like you have to get more money. How are we ever going to be able to get from underneath the weight of renting, right? How can we be homeowners if you won't have any any sort of legislation that prevents us from being homeless? Because once you're homeless, it's hard to get back to home. Once you're homeless, it's hard for anyone to talk to you the same way as if you were just struggling with the foreclosure, just struggling to get your rent, right? You have to go from the bottom to beneath the bottom just to be heard. My mom and I, we know that our housing is temporary and we're going to have to try and find somewhere where rent is affordable, but we just want to be treated like people. I know that everyone who is up there and people who are going to see this later, they all were voted in by somebody. And I'm not going to say that you don't deserve the seat that you have because I know that you do. But what I would say is if there's no one here to vote for you, then how will you stay there? If there's no one here who has the house to be in the county or be in the city that you're in, you know, what then what is the purpose? And I think that, you know, as I'm saying this, I'm getting a little emotional because in the temporary place that we're staying, there are three housing developments around us that are being built. And no one in the in the neighborhood that I live in could afford to stay in any of them because the houses that I'm staying in were built in 1960, but the house that's literally 10 yards behind where I'm living is going for $300,000 in their apartments. And I say to myself, how could I possibly stay here? I want to live in Atlanta, I want to be a thriving member of this community, but I'm not being given a fair shake. And I think that this legislation is necessary not only for our senior citizens who most definitely are being put out of their homes, not only for normal working men and women who just want to be able to get by day to day, but for someone like my mom and I who we don't need the best, we don't need the brightest, but we do need stability. And I think that there's nobody who should ever feel less of a person or less than anyone else when it comes to just being able to wake up in the morning and say, I have a place I can call my own. And that's all that I think any of us want. My story goes much deeper than just bill 125, but I want to add my voice to this petition that says, in Cobb County, which is where I live by the way, I know Mr. Wright is not here and I'm like, dude, when you talk, but in Cobb County, right? The meeting is he'll be back. Cobb County, one of the richest counties in Georgia can't find a way to help one family that did their job, that does their job on a day-to-day basis, find stable homes in a city. I live in Mableton, by the way. And a very brand new city with shiny new mayors and representatives who don't live in Mableton, by the way, who say, it's okay. We'll let these practices continue and you'll eventually find somewhere to live. That's not right. And so I want to add my voice to this. I appreciate you adding your voice and believe me, you're being heard and we want to make sure that you've given us a way to stay in contact with you. We don't come back into session into January, so this is not something that's going to happen overnight, unfortunately, but we are going to be working for you. And then if we can refer you to any programs or anything, I'll be happy to do that as well. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Alanzoo. Williams. Williams, I got you. Thank you. Now we have Mr. Steven Davis and then Ms. Elizabeth Apley. And you're both talking about rent control, correct? Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon, everyone. Madam Chair, members of the committee. My name is Steven Davis, and I'm the government affairs director for the Georgia apartment association. The association is the voice for the multifamily housing industry in the state of Georgia. Our members provide homes to millions of Georgians directly employing more than 5,000 Georgians and businesses supporting the industry more than 125,000 jobs. Additionally, our members contribute more than $1.45 billion in taxes and other revenue. And everyone knew, everyone, 100 new apartment homes developed, generates an additional $384,000 in taxes and an additional 47 local jobs for the economy. While the idea of rent control may appear as an attractive solution to the affordable housing crisis, it is critical to understand its counterproductive and damaging consequences. Rent control continues to negatively impact housing parameters and renewers alike. National research shows these policies reduce housing supply, lower properties values, and decreases the quality of available properties. Research also shows that rent control doesn't incentivize this new construction of apartments, which only exacerbates the housing and affordability crisis. As an example, in late 2021, voters in St. Paul, St. Paul, Minnesota passed a ballot measure to make rent control in their city. This event has a little early researchers to view this data in real time on rent controls and negative impacts on the very amount of new apartments when this type of legislation is enacted in terms of passing, voting permits for multifamily housing dropped by 80% in the city, while their token city, the Minneapolis, which does not have the same restrictions, voting permits increased. It may sound simple, adding additional housing units to the market is the best way to address the housing demand and crisis, simple supply and demand. Governments at all levels must look beyond regulations, which add cost and develop legislation that reduces barriers to new construction and expands tax policies to encourage development. So, in closing, rent control will lead to a degradation of existing housing stock and a reduction in property values and local real estate tax revenues. Rent control will deter investment in housing stock, which we so desperately need in the state of Georgia. And rent control will not address our supply and demand imbalance, and will only exacerbate the deficiency of housing opportunities for all. Thank you for your time. Let me take some questions. Before that, let me just mention to you that there are different ways to have rent control there. So, I don't know the cities that you mentioned and how they have gone down in apartments being built. But we are looking at allowing the municipalities and the counties to have some input and not just band it and saying it can't go over 10% ever. We don't want anything like that, this had even something that will help the cities. We want to make sure that we're not gouging those tenants, those residents. So, that's what that's what that's. Okay, and we have the board is lit up. So, we're going to start with before Representative Thomas, I see we've been joined by other representatives, one of them saying hello. And then we're taking questions. Okay, just fine. All right, is it on? I thought it was. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you, sir, for being here and just briefly to address those who are sitting here today. Please know that you your story has merit. You're here representing those who can't be here. And you're certainly representing your interest in a long term residency that you hope would be able to be provided in a situation where you are not threatened out of your homes or your rescindesies. My name is Elmandee Holley, I'm a fifth year state house representative member from the Great County of Henry, as well as it is a little slice of Clayton County there. And I have another meeting to go to. I do appreciate Senator James to be able to have this panel here in our distinguished colleagues in the Senate and my friends in the House as well. I just have a very small question if you would mind. I understand that certainly in areas that are not highly dense and the size of the apartments or the size of housing that you know certainly have a lot of land upon which to build. The downside of being able to have where you don't have any side of rent or until control there when you have over development when you have highly dense environments. You know it contributes to you know small, you know in terms of the influx of heavy traffic for those who are living around there. You know you have it where it's it's a lack of green space. We know that that contributes very damaging effects towards people's ability to actually breathe well. You know you have a threatens those who may have respiratory issues. And also it just doesn't really grant a place for people to be able to kind of be able to move freely. The mobility may be stifled by having that. So if rent control is not an option and if expanding the growth of housing projects, if we take that off the table, what might be a feasible alternative that we're not looking at you know in terms of making it a possibility with people able to stay in their houses but you know but they're still able to afford to live there. Again taking development, expensive development off the table. Yes I think with the question I think we have to look at the operating continuing operating cost that are happening right now. Georgia is what we're looking at one of the biggest issues right now with jackpot juries driving up the cost of insurance on properties which is drives up the cost that is needed to operate. You also have to look at where the other operating cost of property taxes continue to go up as the property values continue to go up. You've got to look at what the operating costs are in right now with inflation going up as well. The goals continue to go up and those bills have to be have to be paid by someone in this case it is it is the renter in that case. I guess the solution is looking at what what does the government control in these aspects and most of this comes down to the local government control. Property taxes is another one issue. I do realize they have services that must be provided but if they can look at do all the services need to be provided what could potentially usually no services ever get cut back and so your property taxes continue to either the others it might not change but since your value went up your property taxes go up. Just looking at whipped and local government actually control when it comes to it in taxes and fees are usually that that is an aspect that they can control. You think for responding. I know this is something that our committee is going to be studying. I have the the fastest growing county in the state by you know Atlanta region commission standards and I know that the legislature this past year took away the ability for our small local governments to be able to extend a moratorium on building more houses outside of a 180 day span and what that does do is while granted maybe great for developers it does add to extra density on a high density area and I know that that is certainly it runs counter to what maybe local residents were expecting for when they you know move into a nice house we're expecting to see you know houses on top of each other right so I appreciate your response on there and just look forward to working with the panel committee and days ahead because we have to have some way of doing it we know that the book has to be passed down to someone but we should be smart enough to think of you know maybe some other alternatives to this work simply just saying we've been a pass down to the renter really just shows we have a lack of ideas. Yes so with the county situation and with most more deoriams the the planning phase is what they most the time are trying to to hit and we've worked with Henry County on a multi family housing ordinance as they updated it which did add significant cost to the development of communities in Henry County and will lead to increased rents in the county. Thank you thank you very much and thank you for joining us this time and let me have your comments you can send to us in writing. Okay we have two other questions for you representative Thomas Nicks and then Senator Merritt and then we'll move on to the next speaker. Greetings thank you for your presentation I too like representative Holly concur with his sentiments let me just say this I live in the new city of south-fals and it's a six-year-old city senator James and I both live there we fought for 10 years to become a city the reason why we did that is primarily because this was the last area of land to be developed and we wanted to develop that smartly and that includes workforce and housing so in your presentation you mentioned the key is to not not to have rent control but to increase housing inventory for instance in the city well in Seattle Washington there is no more land they're building on top of buildings they can only build up in South Fulton we were the only undeveloped land left in Fulton County so if the answer is to continue to develop to create inventory what do we do when there is no land. Within side of a municipality the answer is vertical to increase density. Georgia and Fulton County is blessed by being a large area with on the south side the topography is better for for building houses and apartments compared to other parts I think density supply was the answer to if you want to reduce the cost of living you have to supply and demand the that's that is the answer is if once supply reaches so high you will see the cost supplies and come down but right now most local governments are doing the opposite of that and installing additional regulations and installing additional burdens to development on the same day a local government here two years ago raised the military and increased impact fees on the same day while saying they wanted more affordable housing they increased with the operations cost and the development cost of communities so sometimes there appears to be a disconnect between the what people are saying and then the policies that they are implementing every condition that is put on a new development has a cost it is not free every time that there is a work order that is changed because of something happening it has a cost and it has to be paid for every delay and getting up permanent which I worked with the city of south world and right when it was started in a previous job to try to help their permitting department to go through faster every delay causes a housing unit to go up so we've got to look at how can government become more efficient in moving it out so if you if you can reduce the amount of time that a permit and this is local not under the state jurisdiction but if a local government can reduce the amount of time that it takes to get a permit if they can reduce the amount of conditions that are going into into a property I think that will have a major impact in the final cost of the product is excuse me but we cannot they cannot do that unless we lift the ban on rent control right now the hands of elected officials over municipalities and counties have nothing to do with things as a man of his own excuse me go. I'm sorry for those in confusion I meant as you look at the operating and development cost the items that are put on a condition have a cost that this is a condition that is put on a rezoning request as a cost that adds to the cost of the development which means if you come in and rent was supposed to be a thousand dollars it's going to add hundreds of thousands of not millions of dollars to the cost of the development and when you're trying to put together your capital stack and bring out your plan that will add cost that will cost rent to go up so if they local government is concerned about affordability then they need to look at what are the costs that they are adding to the cost of the development and most of the time it appears that local governments are not looking at that they'll say they want affordable housing but then they put 40 conditions on a new development that adds hundreds of thousands of not millions of dollars of cost so there's a disconnect between the policy and what's being said. I understand but they also is a problem with all of those costs being put on the resident because number one yes they're going to be some more expensive rental costs however to double and triple and even quadruple the lease when you get ready to renew the lease something's terribly wrong there and that's why we were making sure that we meet we talk about this we put some legislation in to protect the citizens. Yes ma'am. Thank you one more. Senator Merritt. Thank you Madam Chair I think my question has been answered but my question was you know people want to know why is my rent going out? Why's my rent going up every month? What's happening? So you're telling me the drivers if I'm understanding you correctly operations costs goes up for you guys property taxes goes up and if I'm not mistaken property taxes are driven by market part of that formula they come up with is driven by market and then I guess those are the drivers I understand and you're telling me that the land owner or the owner is not driving that cost in this formula in any way to get more profit. So help me so yes hold on so help me understand how how the rent is calculated what is driving the high rents besides what I'm what I just said what else is there. Yes ma'am I'm getting into two ways in new development projects that is formulated based on the cost of the development so if something's built today that goes into line with everything that it took to develop the cost of that property. So but if you look at a legacy property that's been I guess a year old year or older as it's leasing up multiple things go into account one the availability of units in the area what is the vacancy rate we've experienced record high vacancy rates within the metro area and a lot of that is attributed to a false sense of vacancy based on that infleton county it's taking upwards of nine to 12 months to get an eviction and you have renters in a unit not paying their rent in other metro counties it's taking upwards of six months to get an eviction where no rent is being paid so that has to go into the account the vacancy rate the folks that work with us the the folks I mentioned that are directly employed our members they want increases in salaries and we our members are giving them increases in salaries we have some maintenance technicians that are making six figures to work in our industry and that is accounted for a lot of that that we have to pay our employees to keep that everyone's having trouble finding and retaining employees and when you have that trouble you have to raise their pay to do that that also contributes into then there's the regulation inspections that are required that contribute to an ongoing monthly cost for it utilities that continue to go up are going into it and then we're experiencing members whose insurance rates for the properties continue to go up 40 50 60 percent year over year that that is a cost that is instrumentably we hope that is something that the general assembly will take up in the coming session so how much profit does the owner get though out of all you just said what percentage of that the owner is still making a profit the owner does generally this is from our national association for every one dollar of rent an owner makes somewhere between nine and ten cents okay one more question yes ma'am you're correlating supply with supply has is is a factor in rent going up so if we had more supply the rents would go down yes ma'am you have data support that okay you can do actually see what as you drive around if you see a sign where it says we're offering a free month rent or four hundred dollars all for this that shows that is it can it is a is a offer that is made because there is the market fill softer in that area and there's enough renters there and they're trying to incentivize that renter to come there and so it is showing that if since there's if there's too much supply in that area then they were trying to get renter to that area so it the higher the higher the rent goes as based on the lack of supply the more supply you have you will naturally draw down on what the price of rent is because then it increases competition yes ma'am yes ma'am some of the office right now office commercial properties when there is a lot of office supply that is out there you will see the price go down and it's the same way for for housing thank you yes ma'am just a quick question something you just missed my mind just say like a dollar one of us makes only 19 10 cents you know 10% is that you have any study anything that you know then back down I'm just wondering you know yes that are all regional association put together that that study using national figures and I can send that to you all right thank you appreciate thank you very much and I'm going to call four names in a row but you know come after each other Elizabeth Appley then Alison Johnson then Miss Gladys lady Nancy you and I got you got to go oh you okay thank you very much thank you madam chair can you hear me okay I can hear you yes my name is Elizabeth Appley I'm an attorney and advocate and I thank you for the opportunity to be here on such an important issue I advocated the capital to strengthen Georgia law and increase the resources to support access to safe decent affordable housing to prevent homelessness and I work on behalf of the number okay enterprise community partners out these to press materials for better Georgia 95 Georgia the Georgia support of housing association Georgia advancing communities together and house ATL so the purpose of this legislation I'm talking about SB 125 is to support local control

by communities in order to address the challenges that you've heard so much about today, to help people stay stably and safely housed. And we appreciate your attention to this important issue. For over 30 years, Georgia law has recognized, quote, that housing is an issue of paramount concern to this state, which affects the health welfare and safety of the citizens of the state, and the economic viability and plan growth of its community. That's OCGA 83170. And it also goes on to say that it is the state's policy, quote, to provide decent safe and affordable housing to all segments of the population of this state. That's OCGA 83171. Well, we know that Georgia has fallen very far short of that goal. And while the conditions that have led to the current housing crisis preceded for a very long time, the pandemic, the pandemic did exacerbate the situation. And it has had a disproportionate impact on certain aspects, certain members of our community. People of color, women with children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities have been disproportionately negatively impacted. So we know that housing instability is a very serious problem. It threatens the physical and mental health of adults and children. It threatens children's ability to succeed in school. The ability of parents to hold a job. And we know, in fact, from recent research that is Georgia specific, that the effect of losing one's home of eviction has a detrimental impact on pregnancy outcomes, preterm delivery, low birth weight with multi-generational adverse impacts. So 2021 saw a historic increase in rents. A recent article in the Atlanta paper looking at the metro area found that while rent rates had increased between 2.4 and 5.7 percent between 2014 and 2020, in 2021, they increased by 17.8 percent. And so keep in mind that even though we see in 2022, the rate of increase was reduced down to 1.3 percent, the effect of those increases is cumulative, pardon me. So if your rent was 1,500 dollars a month the beginning of 2021, by the end, you're at $1,767 a month. And by the end of that year, you're paying an annual increase of over $3,200. Keep in mind that most families, 60 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. So when you see a massive increase like that, you hear the stories that you're hearing today. So as of April of this year, 14 percent of Georgia renter households were behind on their rent. That's over 181,000 Georgia households. And we know, as I said earlier, that those rent arrearages don't occur across the board. They disproportionately impact low income families. 72 percent of those were low income. More than half of those households had children, over 200,000 children are being impacted. And 69 percent were people of color. At the same time, that average rent debt according to the national atlas is $1,400. Compared that to the price that every community pays for each eviction. The University of Arizona law school did an analysis of what it costs the local community for each eviction that occurs in this state. And it was a very conservative estimate of over $11,200 per eviction, looking only at the cost of emergency shelter, medical hospitalization, emergency room visits, welfare costs, and child delinquency costs. So we know that the cost of eviction, according to that analysis, is eight times the rent arrearage. It's relatively inexpensive to keep families safely and stably housed as opposed to the cost of eviction. We know that wages have failed to keep up. We've seen some modest increases in recent years, but nowhere near approaching the increase in the cost of rent. So we have, regrettably in Georgia, had some of the highest eviction rates of any state in the country. And this has been true for decades. The face of eviction, as you know from the research, is black women with children who are disproportionately targeted, and they're two to four times more likely to be evicted than a white person. Having children greatly increases the risk of eviction. And we know that over 20% of foster care placements in this state are due to housing inadequacy. So we are continuing as a community, as a state, as taxpayers, to pay the price of failing to address the problem of affordability. Georgia is an outlier in failing to provide even basic tenant protections, which are necessary for families to remain safely and stably housed. I want to mention to this committee House Bill 404, which passed the House of Representatives unanimously last year. I was going to call out Senator Redt and thank him for his support for the legislation in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Regrettably, it didn't, it wasn't called up on the final days of the session to, for a vote. That legislation would provide a warranty of habitability. It would require that there be a two month cap on security deposits, and it would require a three business day notice and write to cure before an eviction can be filed. We appreciate, we look forward to your strong support. We're trying to strengthen that legislation and move it forward to final passage in 2024. You all asked about the issue of solutions, which I hadn't a plan to address in my plan testimony, but if you want me to address solutions, I'm happy to go into that. Madam Chair. Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Not not per client, by the way. So, you know, Mr. Davis is right that an increased supply does bring down costs, but it has to be the right supply. What we see overwhelmingly, I'm so sorry, in Atlanta is we're destroying what we call naturally occurring affordable housing, older properties, maybe haven't been well maintained, those are being destroyed and replaced with luxury units. That does not help the people who are trying to address who have needs. We need to address the challenges of tenant protections. We are, as I said earlier, a vast outlier in providing even the minimal protections that are neighbors, even here in the southeast, which are not particularly tenant friendly have. And so bringing a measure of fairness to the landlord relationship, reducing evictions is very important. We need also eviction diversion tools. We need emergency rental assistance. There's a small program that the Department of Community Affairs is instituting now in conjunction with Atlanta Legal Aid Society and Georgia Legal Services to use some of the balance in the federal emergency rental assistance funds in order to provide legal services and to help people access emergency rental assistance. The City of Atlanta is working on an initiative to provide emergency rental assistance and to provide and so that that triumvirate of diversion legal representation and emergency rental assistance are critically important. We need to increase the state's investment in the construction preservation of affordable housing. Georgia now has one tool that it utilizes to construct or preserve affordable housing and that's the state low income housing tax credit. Currently under review by the joint tax credit panel. So it's critically important that we protect the state low income housing tax credit because otherwise there are no state dollars going into construction or preservation. We also need to invest in subsidies for vulnerable populations. There are some populations that need permanent supportive housing. There are seniors, there are people with disabilities. Chairman Mitchell mentioned today's Wall Street Journal. Today's Wall Street Journal front page has a story about the problem of seniors becoming homeless. The highest rate of increase in homelessness is among seniors and the level of homelessness among seniors in this country today, according to HUD, has never been seen since the Great Depression. And these are people many of whom have worked their entire lives. They've worked physically demanding jobs. They don't have that safety net that we'd like for them to have. So subsidies are going to be necessary. And the way states that have been successful in investing in the construction preservation of housing and providing those subsidies and providing the flexibility to local communities to address affordability, they've done that through the dedication of revenue. Joe Frank Harris proposed that some 30 years ago. The housing trust fund for the homeless was renamed and the dedication was removed. But the power of the housing trust fund, the legal authority to create, preserve, invest, grant, loan, all there. We have an 11 billion plus surplus. Let's invest some of that money into the housing trust fund and allow the Department of Community Affairs to spend that in a way that will support affordability. Thank you for your indulgence. Thank you for allowing me the extra minutes. We look forward to being a resource to you, to the committee, as we continue to work on this issue. Thank you very much for always informing us and the information you just shared with us. I would like to get that because I know it's going to be a lot of people who are listening. Now, we're going to ask more about it so we could get a list of it. I can do research to make sure that those people who need it will be able to help. Is it anything that the couple, the young man and his mother who talked earlier that they could immediately go and apply for? Yes. The emergency rent, well, they're homeless. So it's not a three-year-old. So it's not a five-year-old. They just got close. You've been foreclosed upon? They had the rent to buy, right? We were going to house right now, right now, somewhere early. I actually think, I moved out of the house and he's still available. I mean, it has to go to court. It's the reason we should put that in the end, that chair. So I'm sure you're able to go to court in Tui's. The front myself, that's my way more of you than anything after I move out of it. So yeah, if I could talk to you. If you could talk, yeah. How many more people want to speak? Because I have a big list right here. And I know we can't. Okay. Madam Chair, I apologize. I'm going to have to leave. I'll give the gentleman my heart and of course, available. I'll get you the citations to the research that I have. Thank you very much. We appreciate you. Okay, Ms. Alison Johnson, then Nancy, and Lady G. And Closest. Which one? It's the, um, camp Creek. You see your, but then you'll be right after her. Thank you. Oh, I didn't see you anymore because you were sitting. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Go ahead, please. Thank you. I'll be really quick because I too have to leave. But I do want to be here to be on the record. My name is Alison Johnson. I'm the executive director with Housing Justice League. We also work really closely with folks in the community, particularly tenants, those both in private or in subsidized housing. I do want to put on the record to say we do support SB 125. And so do so many thousands of folks throughout the state of Georgia. We have formed what we call a Georgia fall writ stabilization coalition. And this is a coalition that brings people from all different regions and counties together to figure out strategically how do we support getting this bill through the threshold. But more importantly, I just want to say that at Housing Justice League, we do have a hotline. And I just want to say we are inundated to a point where we can, it's really hard for us to continue to have this hotline because of the need. And the need that we are hearing is people need support. People need money to stay in their homes. We have people that are working really hard, two and three jobs and just cannot afford the increases of rips that have been placed on them in between their leases. We are people that are calling us because of the conditions in which they are living and the landlords still allow to raise their rents. And so we also have people that are calling us because their parents are seniors. And they can know some landlords are not allowing them to remain in a dwelling to be the caretaker of their senior parents. So these are things that are all factors and contributors into people being displaced in our communities. And like Elizabeth said, we work with people who are disproportionately impacted by these factors, particularly black women and go down to a full in county. I'll say last month, 72,000 evictions. This is, this is just crazy that this is allowed to happen. We know that in the state of Georgia, we have corporate and we have private equity who have comment and have just totally squeezed the market, making the rents so astronomical where people cannot afford to live. And those folks who were once at the point where they want it to become homeowners no longer have that dream. So I encourage you all to continue to fight and you have people on the outside that you don't hear, but you most definitely see them in corners and cracks and under the bridges that need this specific legislation passed. We are eons behind other states. And like you all said, there are multitudes of ways to enact rent control and restabilization. And we have to do that. We have to do that. And we have to continue discontinue to allow the price gouging that's happening. These are communities are just inundated and about we are on the breaking point. And so we just we need this legislation to be passed. So thanks. Thank you so much. Thank you. And ladies, what's your name? I am on the somewhere. I am on the you came early. Oh, you're next. Well, they're next. And then because I skipped over their names early. Thank you. Good afternoon. You're very beautiful. By the way, he writing it. To consider. Thank you. Senator Dunnell, Dunnell James and Sir Dias. I'm here to wonder is it legal what they're doing to the seniors in my building. I live in Galleria, Manor, senior apartments in Smirna. And our rent has gone up $300 to $50 a month to $400 more a month. And we're all on fixed income. And they're about to put us all in a terrible fix. Not only are they doing that, but they're making the seniors pay $20 a month to park in a senior building because the seniors had been arguing over park and spots. And some of the seniors are so stressed out. We've had three deaths in the past month. And I think that because they're stressed, where are we going at 85, what I'm 83 years old, but where do you go from here? And is it legal what they're doing? And we're told we can't do anything because this is private property. But this is senior affordable property. And they're making everybody now market price. We don't get market money. We don't get $350 extra a year, but they want us to pay $350 extra a month. And what do we go from here? Thank you very much. Anybody want to comment to that? How can it switch from affordable to market? One thing is a very demanding location. I'm on your two blocks from the Brave Stadium. I can go up on the back and then look at the stadium at some of the apartments. So it's very demanding. They need that every year. I will pass that. Oh yeah, they're pushing the sound. But where are we going? We don't have the money to move. Like we want to, I moved here from New Jersey 10 years ago. And they have changed management in this building over seven times. And the new management just sent us the notice 90 days ago that they're going up $350 more a month on our rent. Where we're getting it from. It says market value. I came up for affordable novice market. I call it green. That's what it is. Say it again. It didn't hear you. I call it green. That's what it is. That's the market price. That's the market price. Yes, I'm sure. Sorry. Sorry. I just wanted to bring this up to you. Can you tell us? I can't give legal advice. No. Which one of you? I'm number six. Okay. Go ahead. My heart goes out in that situation. But unfortunately, our department is not allowed to give legal advice. Okay. However, my friends down at the other end of the table aren't allowed to give legal advice. But I'm not certain that they can give legal advice to people that aren't members of the Senator of the House. Well, I'm specifically asking you for what she is talking about. They are in senior living quarters. They have these senior buildings. And they go in on a fixed income. And then now they're doubling their rent. Really going $400 more. Yeah. After the one year lease is over. What I'm asking is this legal? I don't know. I'm going to talk about my head. Okay. Okay. Let's just lay the council. Good. Would you like to? 15. I don't know the answer to the question because I don't know the specifics of the type of unit that she may be living in. Some of this does fall under federal housing law, which I am no expert on. So I would have to have more information in order to give an adequate response. Look, Lady G, we will. It's not right. And even if it is, the law accepts allow it. It's not right. So we can talk more about possible legislation. You know, it's very difficult to pass legislation up here. But if you educate the legislators to let them see, that you're not just a name on a piece of paper and you come up and talk to them and have tensions sometimes. We do listen. Right. Because when I moved in, this was a new building. It's 88 units and I was number seven that moved in. So it's a very new building. Wow. But in 10 years, it's almost doubling. But it's beautiful. I know where that building is. You know it is. Beautiful. Yeah, but that's in the areas in demand. Yeah, you're about to say when the brave stadium. Yes. Wow. And the stadium was not there then. It was not there. It was. No, it was when I moved. Right. Right. I remember that. So if anybody could help me, let me know. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you for your time. We have. We should come up with a same way. This is. Miss Richards and do you want to come up together? And for the record, please say your name. And they and and we have our representative that borders that area. Oh, okay. For the record, my name is Micah Richards. I am the CCV sitting president for the joy board. Hi, my name is Tracey Bonner and I am the Camp Creek Village Town Homes secretaire. H.O.A. So essentially we're not on the on the eviction side, but more so on the H.O.A. I guess maybe some sort of legislation to govern H.O.A.s. Just like the young lady spoke earlier, we. Well, I would say a new-ish development. The original developers, I guess they left. That's another story in itself. Rockland came in. They were the new developers, but they were also the decorate over the H.O.A. We had a large pot of money prior to Rockland taking over, but of course because they purchased the majority of the undeveloped lots. They have the controlling vote, i.e. control over all of our money. So now when they move out, oh, let me back up. Also in control of our money, they hired another community association company to manage our funds, which is also their company. So now they control our funds and the company that manages us also is owned by Rockland. Once they left, of course, they just left. They left us in shambles. We created our board, but there's a lot of money that was missing. And reviewing the documentation, they used a lot of our H.O.A. funds for developer-type issues, erecting fences, just monuments, all types of things that the developers are supposed to cover. They used our funds to do so with also we were we are planted as a private community. I don't know if you guys can hear me. We're planted as a private community, so they were supposed to install a gate. We have no gate, but we're still considered private, so we get no support from the city of South Fulton for any sinkholes, infrastructure issues, a ray of things that we need assistance with. So we've just been kind of left in shambles, so to speak. Can we just want to make sure that the city officials are doing proper inspections? For example, our infrastructure is very poor. We have drains that are above the ground. So the water stands in our yards, causing erosion. And because we're a private community, we are responsible for fixing the erosion, which costs thousands of dollars. And so those kind of things have to be done when we're bringing inspectors into our communities, our city officials, not inspector developers, our city officials should have proper inspections throughout the entire process to make sure these things are being done. Because now we are being required to pay for this, and we only have 103 homes. We're a smaller private community. And every time we try to get the city to take over our community, they come in and do an inspection and say, well, you have to fix your curves. Well, these curves have been here since 2006. We've gone through three different phases of developers, and none of them fix these things. And now you're requiring. Yeah, they were able to get their bond back from the city. And so we need to make sure that they don't get their money back until the homeowners, and the residents are being treated fairly and taking care of in their communities. And as a trickle down effect, like she said, a lot of our issues are pretty pricey. In order to cover those, we have to increase our HOA dues. Now there's a large percentage of our community that already can't afford the HOA dues. So now we're tacking on more dues, which is going to trigger evictions, and all of the other things that you guys were discussing today. So it's just a trickle down effect when we don't have proper oversight of the HOA, slash the developers that are coming in and doing county, I mean, city developments. And you know, two other things that we have issues with. Just making sure that these corporations that own that come in and buy up properties and have renters, we need some kind of legislation against that because they're not requiring their renters to follow our covenants, illegal street parking. They don't pay their HOA dues. And then a lot of these corporations do not reside here in Georgia. And so it's very difficult for us to get someone to come in and enforce some of these rules. We can't, we had to find a company on Instagram and reach out to them that way because they didn't have, we went on their website, they didn't have a number that we could find them. So we had to, and that's on my job, you know, I'm an actor, I don't have time for that. But I don't have time to chase down homeowners who are HOA dues and things like that, violations. And then another thing, we have issues with our community improvement districts being brought into our HOA districts, but they're not dealing with certain zone-age. For example, we're zoned behind a plaza that has clubs. And our homeowners have kids who are staying up to three in the morning because these clubs are zoned improperly in front of our communities. And so we need some help with that as well because

the community improvement districts are not willing to work with the homeowners. Got an email today saying just that. So. And then the last thing which is going, I guess back to the other two individuals that spoke about increasing. Or what what does what I want to say, increasing housing essentially in development. So I am a real estate broker on a real estate brokerage. And I work with developers in the city of South Fulton. And I can just attest to the difficulties that we have. I have one developer that was awarded funds to to build affordable housing for seniors. We can't get a permit pass in the city of South Fulton. It's been two years. So we know. And then the city of South Fulton does not have seen your house and then. Oh, one. Yeah. Well, this particular developer. Okay. That one that I have been, you know, and the only one I'm done with that I know of is right there behind that publics on 92 and South Fulton Parkway. And then we have a lot of things that we can do. And then we have a lot of things that we can do. And then we have a lot of things that we can do. Well, we just have the land. We haven't even been able to get to doing any development because we'll send in things. They'll say, Okay, do this, this, this, the next. Then we'll do those things and then they'll say, Oh, we'll do this, this, this. And like, well, why don't you tell us the first time when we submitted this. And then we'll give affordable housing to residents of the city of South Fulton. So just kind of a two part situation with here. Yeah. And I'm really sorry that it worked out that way because I actually authored the legislation to create that city. And then many years later, though, because we had to keep working on it over the years. And it did finally pass. And then we worked with trying to put the city administrators together into departments. And that's entirely different from what the committee had put together for them. As soon as the city council persons and the mayor's got elected, they changed all of that. And then we have the questions that I mean the concerns you have. We have the address on the city level. Correct. They have to just have a smoother process of being able to transact business in the city of South Fulton. Because it really does hinder. I have clients that have been waiting for homes for two years. And we can't get through permitting in the city of South Fulton. And then you have a friend too that wanted to put. Yes, I had some issues having a permit issue. Some other businesses in the software. And solved by now, but it took a lot longer than I would expect. And they had purchased a land start building on it and couldn't get the permits. And most of them had to wait like months and months of just sitting there in the property and the structure that they had already built was sitting there vacant empty when the end of last. But there are a lot of problems that need to happen. So, you know, maybe we could all sit down together with the city. You did when I first met you, both of you, it was unfortunately when the young man was killed about a drunk driver at, you know, at that. And we've had forced accidents since that. Oh my god. That's the way. Yes. We had to have everything changed anything. That's a few blocks from my house. Right. And that's where my son. Yeah, cute. When he was a teenager. Right. They did work on the light, the turning light, but nothing else has. Right. I noticed that. Well, we, well, we are still working there still working on trying to get that done, but that's DOT and that's under the state. Right. And that way I can help you directly when it's more of a state issue, but, but the issues now the reason we introduce the legislation on HOAs. And then the other one on lifting the ban on rent control is to make sure that we take care of the residents. And then I have the same problem. And with the HOAs, they definitely have to have some sort of oversight of restrictions. I don't think that it's fair for the developer or that to be the decorate over the HOA. There's who was who was looking out for the residents, because like I said, after they left, they ran through our money. And now we're just sitting here and they're gone. And we had to go through all of the, their standing and expenses to find, I think, like 20,000, at least $20,000 of our money that they use to do things that they promised us when we signed our contract. So we need better oversight over over that is just, I mean, because we're not official board members at that time. We could look at the finances so we could only take our community manager's word for it. Did you have a question? Yes, sir. Well, I just wanted to mention to you, Madam Chairman, that House Bill 630, which was sponsored by Representative Lim of the 98th, would have taken it. It didn't pass, but it would have, it had taken into account some of the things you're discussing. And again, our office is nonpartisan. So I can't say, well, this is a great bill or this is a bad bill. But just that representative spill talked about how. So it was House Bill 630. It was the end monopolies and housing act. And it proposed registering some of these corporations that own properties with the Secretary of State so that if you wanted to know what corporation went and owned a certain. Is that bill still alive or died in the position? The final disposition was it was second red in the house. I'm not quite certain. Okay, so no, it's not moving. However, you can look it up in monopolies and what? The end monopolies and housing act. It was hb630. This year. That's this year correct. I think it has been. I think it has been reintroduced. It was reintroduced this year. So that means it's still alive. Okay, you want to say something Senator. So do we have any legal recourse? Do we have any recourse dealing with these developers who. Come in and you know, they've a lot. They got some sort of approval from the state to get their bonds back. So where does that leave us as residents? Maybe we can ask. So we can ask. So we can ask. Do they have any recourse? Oh, I had 14. Sorry. That's okay. Again, I think this is the situation where I would need more details about the, the specifics of your case to be able to advise what potential recourse there is. How do we can contact you because we have. I'm sorry, but I can't provide advice specifically to you. What if you get in contact with a member. The member can ask questions generally about the state of the law. And when we go to meet with her, we can take you with us. That's not perfect. Thank you. Thank you. And we have questions. No, put about you since you know, this is your area. This is a comelita gums is the city council. She's doing a great job and other things that again. And oh, yeah, representative Roger Bruce. Okay. So we'll try to get in touch with them. And we need to stay in touch. So we can do it. Doing the interval before January. We can deal with your issue now and see if it's something we can do. Do we have your evening? Do we have your conversation? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You do have. I have it. He's my administrative assistant and I got my chief of staff in here and my eight. Elena, you want to talk to him? Make sure they got my numbers. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. What's your name? I don't. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to have you to come up now. I'm going to have you to come up. I'm going to have you to come up. And then after that, who else? Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. So I, I'm sorry, I want to refer back to my nose. I'm up here. And I play a. A dual role. And I wanted to piggyback a little bit off of what. I'm going to have you to come up. I'm going to have you to come up. I am. A resident of the city of South Portland. When I moved to the city of South Portland, it was Atlanta. I am now the tenet of the home I once owned. The company, the corporation who came in and bought a lot of homes in this subdivision. I was in the city of South Portland. I was in the city of South Portland. I was in the city of South Portland. When I purchased a home, I was 21 years old. When I first purchased a home, I was 21. I literally, because of, because of my childhood issues of being evicted and being homeless and our family living in shelters down here, I started saving at 15 years old. Parish. I was loved to see Artway Island Mediation at 21 years old only to have a corporation come and not call my door so it's coming to me that they purchased my home from the for Dante County court-steps, while. Yes. It's for mortgage default, but I was literally on a payment plan in lost mitigation. So I don't know how that took place. However, when they came to my home, they told me that they purchased a home on the Fords and County court steps. And I had two choices. They can evict me or I can become a tenant. And because of my childhood drama, I did not want to become evicted. I became a tenant. And when I became a tenant, unbeknownst to me, because at that time, I was young. Next month will be 15 years. I will be there and at home. When I became the tenant, I did not know that I was in a binding contract where I could no longer voice my concern about the home being wrongfully foreclosed. Because the contract is binding. Essentially, what I have, what I said, what I said was, I'm aware of the foreclosure, but I did, I was not aware of the foreclosure. I never got, I never got a cell date. So fast forward to be to become an tenant. Now that I know more about it, I've been seeking to regain the ownership of the home. But since I've been seeking to regain the ownership, the landlord has been fouling vicious eviction notices to evict me because the property has one up. When I moved to Camp Creek, Camp Creek wasn't Camp Creek. You know, it was not as developed. The price is triple now. And I live in Pittman Park, so that's awful, but in a role. Oh, okay. So yes, so you have to get to myself the vision there. So to my point, as far as being an owner and previous owner and tenant, Georgia, Georgia has nothing that protects borrowers. And now that I'm a tenant, Georgia has nothing that protects tenants. There are tenants built on rights, isn't it? But the tenants built rights. So there's some things that's there. But it's not enough. I wasn't protected on either ends. So my point as far as the tenants is concerned because I'm literally in court right now fighting a stay until the wrongful foreclosure part is done. But I wanted to bring up as far as the rent control is concerned. Being a tenant, there are hitting fees that is in addition to that I feel that should be governed in those leases because the rent can go up. But then you have you have the flexible month to month fees. And I'm going to refer to my lease. And I'm just going to assume that a lot of leases could be this way because this company is an enormous company. You have the flexible month to month fees. You have legal fees, legal fees in which they add, they tap on. So if you go file an eviction in Forts and County, when you file that eviction, okay, so so many evictions that were filed with falls, right? You have to pay a $200 legal fee. But if you go down there and you and you recall that eviction, the landlord does. You're paying double the legal fee. Well, that should never happen. I shouldn't, as a tenant, I shouldn't be responsible for paying double the legal fee for something you filed and you came back and you recalled, particularly if you filed it viciously. So my lease has the month to month fees, the legal fees, a continuation fee. And I'm referring to a ledger that they submitted to Forts and County to the eviction course. The fluctuating late fees, the master policy admin fees, and then there's hidden fees that's just coded that's on the ledger. So there are layers of fees. So when you're saying I'm behind on rent, what's included in this are all of the other fees that may be over $1,000 that just should not be there. And it's there. So the course is there, but it's not there in the lease. That's a problem because the courts are not, they're not going to go that far and dipped with it. What they'll expect you to do is have an attorney. You can't even appear, proceed and be respected as being appearing as, proceed. You need an attorney. And if you have the attorney, they're not digging that deep because the judges, it's landlord friendly, just being honest. I've said on many cases besides mine, but it's landlord friendly. So the objective is let's come up with an agreement. So you want to stay in a home or you want to pay all of these additional fees. You want to stay in a home, pay all additional fees or just become another number in risk being homeless. Well, we're talking about three, we're talking about three pieces of legislation today. And four closures was not a part of it, but clearly all of the problems that you're having are a part of what is going on. Yes. So we do need to look at the legislation to see if we can incorporate anything that could help your situation. But, yes. I don't mean because you all but many of us, a lot of us are going through this. And it's just not, if you go to the court, you're expecting the court to protect you, their protection is not there. You must say. No, no. Wow. Well, I think you're going to see what we can do. We'll record it and we'll try to do what we can to help. And if you want to contact us again individually, then I think that we can let you talk to Dory Henry over here, my chief of staff, because she knows about the leases and the four closures and evictions and all of that. So, Dory Henry, you want to make sure that she has your number. And I thank you for coming today and seeing with us. And we have 10 minutes before they're going to throw us out. Thank you. We have, how many more people did I speak? I know Amanda. Amanda, who else? The other people left on the back row? Okay, please come up. I'm so sorry. It took so long. Let's see, where it happened to Judy Eccles and Shah Bates? Shah Levin. Did she have anything in writing that she wanted to leave us? She was, she has the same concern you have. Okay. Okay. Okay. And if I love anybody office because I don't see your name on here, but Amanda, I know you told her early. Yes, ma'am. And you've been very patient and our list got tossed around. No, it's quite all right. I understand how that goes. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I appreciate you. Of course. Thank you. And please let us hear. Your issue. Okay. First of all, before I begin, I want to say that everything that everybody has said today is well known and par for the course and what's known as HOA Health. That is what I'm here to speak on as SB 29. My name is Dr Amanda Dutton. I am an independent researcher, a Georgia resident, and a consultant for the HRLNG. That's the Homeowners Reform League National Group, which was mentioned by David. Those of you concerned about HOA reform, please look us up on the internet, HRLNG. I'm here to show my appreciation and support to the committee and sponsors of SB 29. I'm here because I, we, when our founder, given rights back, the current structure of HOAs allowed them to knowingly and willingly deny American citizens their constitutional and human rights. Not all HOAs abused their power, of course, but those that do have created horrific situations that you've heard of that have American citizens leave American citizens with ruined credit, devastated finances and in homelessness. Sometimes because those people only painted their home the wrong shade of beige. I know of an association operating contrary to Georgia code, specifically. They were informed and they did not care. They also, this association also is known for not giving new homeowners contracts. So people by these homes are and are bound to this association without even knowing. Only residents, the only thing that residents can do in these situations is to sue. This can cost thousands of dollars and if you lose the lawsuit against a nature way, you have to pay their legal fees. Some people have legal fees of up to 60, 80, hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not right. The whole system is a racket. Fraud, corruption and abuse is intolerable in anyone in a position of power. From people in the humblest positions to the highest office in the land, it is intolerable. Yet many of us suffer these conditions from our own neighbors. It must end. I read from the Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it. It must end. We must alter it. SB 29 is the first step in that direction. I thank everyone here for their efforts and dedication to protecting and restoring the promise of America to Americans. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do we have any questions or comments? Well, comments, all this heartbreaking story. Thank you for coming in and educating us. As I would say before the session, you know, begin like you all to come, continue to email us meters and individually, and I will be glad to. I am sure all of us will be able to listen to a little bit more details. I know we have three different bills, but to me, it looks like to handle some of this issue, we might have to, instead of putting it in one bill, we might have to have one big bills or maybe piss me. I don't know. We have to figure it out. We will do our best. How can provide some relief to our citizens, that's our duty. We can do anything that we can do within our power to help our citizens. I thank you for all of your deposits today. It was a great education. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. It is appreciated. And just so you know, I am an academic and professional researcher. It's part of my independent research right now to inform myself on this whole situation. Again, as an objective academic with professional research, so I'm happy to contribute. I am planning perhaps putting together a lecture circuit that I'd be happy to, I don't want to say test out on you, but it's to share. Let's say let's share with you and to educate the general population because many people don't understand what's happening. Well, it looks like we have a really good advisory committee if you'll be a part of it and the young man right here and two other people who we've talked to including Mr. David. So we would like to talk again, even if we do it on a conference call. Yes ma'am. So make sure we have your contact information. And please know that we're going to use this information to do something in January. Thank you. To address these concerns. It would be my honor to serve and contribute. Thank you so much. And, uh, uh, Mandisha Thomas, uh, St. Ruff. Thank you for staying with us and being with us this whole time today. I know you came to just block me to this group about your concerns. So thank you very much. And thank you all of our members and especially Immanuel Jones, who's who's on the call watching us. We were streaming. He's been watching us. They were not somehow we couldn't get him in to ask questions, but he's been texting me. So I know that he's still with us. Thank you committee members of the Legislative Council and uh, research. And we got to thank the media. Yes. Because they kept us kept us on. We were scared. But thank you again. We are going to officially adjourn this meeting. And, uh, we do have one other meetings since we did not address the hospitals. We have to have one more meeting maybe in of them. We do have to address the fact that we have to get a hospital in metropolitan and valley. And hopefully about our board are either in the downtown of that area. So this committee, uh, Ferbin Affairs, uh, thanks to you for being here.
