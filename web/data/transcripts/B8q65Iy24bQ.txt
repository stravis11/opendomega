This is video of the Georgia House
earlier today where lawmakers have been
working steadily since about 10 this
morning on and off. And the day could
end late tonight or possibly early
tomorrow morning. Good evening and
welcome to our special 1-hour 40-day
siny die lawmakaker show. Tonight we
wrap up our 55th season of the show on
GPB. Thanks for joining us. I'm Donna
Lowry in Atlanta. We are live from the
capital all evening for interviews with
leaders from both sides of the aisle.
Among the guests, Governor Brian Kemp.
He'll give his view of the legislative
session. And in the studio, we'll have
analysis from Republican political
strategist Brian Robinson and the
interim head of the Georgia Democratic
Party, Matthew Wilson. First, a look at
Siny Dy so far today from Sarah Callas.
Hi, Donna. Lawmakers fulfilled a
preeminent obligation on day 40, but
there's still much to be done in the
final hours of sin die.
The day kicked off with a bill signing
by Governor Brian Kemp. And today I
signed SB36, also known as the Religious
Restoration or the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act or RIFFRA, uh ensuring
that once again at the state level that
Georgians are protected, including
Georgians of faith. In the House,
members got to work agreeing to Senate
changes made to House bills. They gave
final approval to a bill requiring
colleges to disclose funds accepted from
foreign countries of concern. Members
also approved fluorescent pink hunting
garments, infrastructure for vertaports,
and increased indemnification funds for
school resource
officers. After lunch, the House took up
the only bill they are constitutionally
required to pass, the fiscal year 2026
budget. The House and Senate compromise
on House Bill 68 includes big wins for
the state prison system. The Department
of Correction receives an infusion of
$200 million over the current
budget. This is $75 million more than
the governor's original
recommendations. Both the House and the
Senate agree on staffing and safety
increases. However, the House went
further and wanted to recognize the
increased costs for food and health care
in the base budget. But ultimately, we
recognize that some of these
additions are multi-year process and can
be adjusted next year. And HB68 also
funds the Georgia Promise Scholarship,
about 141 million or 1% of the quality
basic education funds. I know many of
you have been receiving updates on the
number of applications and
know that of the 10,000 applications
started, 5,100 have been deemed eligible
for the scholarship to date and that's
as of today. This full funding allows
for more than 21,000 students the
opportunity to participate in the
program. The budget also allocates $15
million for school districts with a
significant number of students in
poverty and keeps funding mental health
initiatives for students. Funding for
the new student support services program
at DOE is preserved, albeit at a
slightly lower number. This includes
nearly $20 million for mental health
support grants for middle and high
schools and $2.3 million to provide
funds for school systems that due to
their size do not earn full funding for
a school social worker. Medical programs
in rural Georgia and grants for timber
farmers also made the final cut of the
budget. The bill passed 170 to 5. The
Senate spent over an hour during this
morning's points of personal privilege
speeches as multiple Democrats angrily
decrieded the banning of DEI programs in
the state schools and colleges with
HB127. The legislation passed late
Wednesday night gutted original language
increasing teacher sick leave days.
Democrats used today's anniversary of
Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination
as a reminder of the importance of
having those programs. I hope this body
will take a different approach to
solving problems and settling different
disagreements today. A better better one
than what we saw on
Wednesday as Republicans in this body
couldn't even bring the fight to us
properly and cut and
run instead of allowing us to represent
those voices that we represent back home
and stay here. If you're going to put a
bad bill here, stay here and fight us on
it. Even if it took all
night, today we should carry the sp
spirit of Dr. King and keep his legacy
in mind as we bear the task of making
decisions that will impact 11 million
people who live in this state. People I
love in a state that I love and I'm very
disappointed by what has been happening
this session and at times were unable to
contain their anger over the issue. Many
of you are pretty good
people. I came to know most of you. You
have a pretty good heart. But some of
you are just
racist and you need to stop it. They
then debated two House bills that dealt
with speed cameras at schools. HB 651
would regulate the use of cameras and
how revenues earned from speed camera
citations are used. The second bill,
HB225, would eliminate the speed cameras
altogether. It repeals all laws relating
to the enforcement of speeding
violations in school zones through the
use of certain devices and prohibits
certain contracts for the enforcement of
speeding violations in school zones
through the use of certain
devices. What it does is it sets a
sunset on the use of these types of
devices here in the state of
Georgia. And if you are
looking at the legislation as
amended, if you go to line 91, it says,
"No contract shall be entered into or
renewed by local governing body or law
enforcement agency for the enforcement
of speeding violations in a school zone
through the use of an automated traffic
enforcement safety device on or after
July 1, 2027."
Both bills were passed and sent back to
the House. The Senate also passed the
FY2026 budget, agreeing to the changes
worked out in the conference committee
54 to1. The Constitution of the State of
Georgia. The Constitution of the State
of Georgia. Also today, new Commissioner
of Labor Barbara Rivera Holmes was sworn
in. We expect lawmakers to work all
night and I'll be back talking with
legislators later. But for the last time
this session, that's my capital report.
Donna
and she said later and later is now
because we're going to that was Sarah on
tape. Now we're going to her go to her
live where Sarah has an interview with
House Speaker John Burns. Sarah,
thank you so much Donna and thank you
Speaker Burns for being here with us
tonight. So a big priority for you that
cleared both chambers was a robust
school safety bill. Can you talk to me a
little bit about the effort behind this
bill? Yeah, it's been uh you know our
number one priority. It's uh it's what
makes Georgia a great place to live, but
we're making sure that our young people,
our students are safe when they go to
school in that learning environment. We
also want to make sure our parents are
aware of that and they feel comfortable
when they drop their kids off, they're
safe. But, you know, you can't learn if
you're not in a secure learning
environment and we're taking we're very
proud of our efforts this year. Uh
Representative Persinger has worked
diligently to make sure we would get
this across the finish line. Appreciate
our House members. certainly appreciate
the Senate too and as we send it on down
to Governor Kemp and another one of your
priorities that cleared both chambers
was protections for IVF or invitro
fertilization. Can you talk to me about
the importance behind this issue? Sure.
You know, there's nothing more important
in our lives than children. And this
creates an opportunity for folks who've
um may have been had challenges with um
having children to create an opportunity
to get it in and codify the legislation
to sure that will be for them be there
for them in the future. And certainly we
have a member Leman Franklin and his
wife Lori are now expecting a little
girl because IVF treatments and c
certainly a blessing and we want to
ensure that's the case because we
respect life in Georgia and the house
has worked very hard at this. We're very
proud of that as well. And perhaps a
more controversial bill was a bill that
would ban transgender girls from girls
sports and that also passed the House
and the Senate with some collaboration.
Can you talk to me a little bit about
this collaborative process between the
House and the Senate on this particular
bill? I can I think that's just it's
it's a good piece of common sense
legislation the people of Georgia have
spoken and uh we we heard from them
during the election in November and
certainly as we continue to hear from
our constituents and people not only in
Georgia but across the country. uh go
the President Trump passed a uh uh
executive order certainly respecting the
right of of to prevent boys from
competing in girls sports and we're
we're proud to be a part of that
movement and and certainly the Riley
Gains Act is um we'll level that playing
field. So when in Georgia we have from
from elementary school through
universities through our higher ed we
have girls competing against girls and
boys against boys. That's the way it
should be. It's a level playing field.
All right and thank you so much Donna.
back to you and your guests in the
studio. Thanks Sarah. I know we'll be
coming back to you later. I do want to
introduce our guest in the studio who
will offer analysis of the legislative
action this session. First, a former
legislator who has spent time in the
house during sin die. Former
Representative Matthew Wilson. He is
currently interim chair of the
Democratic Party of Georgia. Also here
is Republican strategist Brian Robinson.
He's with Robinson Republic. He has
served as deputy chief staff for former
governor Nathan Deal. Welcome to
lawmakers to both of you. Got lots of
good things to discuss. Let's start with
what speaker Burns was talking about.
Pretty successful in terms of his
priorities. Let's start with you this
session, right? He mentioned IVF, school
safety. As soon as the Appalache
shooting happened, which shocked
saddened all of us in Georgia, Speaker
Burns was one of the first statewide
officials to step into that breach and
say, "We've got to do something. We've
got to address these deep concerns that
so many parents and children in this
state have. No kid should go to school
in terror and we have the ability to
strengthen security to put in new
processes. We saw at Appalachi that the
emergency system, the teachers riggered,
got the police there quicker. We saw the
resource officers neutralized the
suspect. So, we've seen those reforms
already work. This just furthers them
and hopefully it's going to keep kids
and teachers safe. The IVF is something
obviously very special to the speaker's
heart. This is a family man. This is
somebody that whenever you speak to him,
whether in public or in private, he's
talking about his wife. He's talking
about his grandkids. This is something
very personal to him. Making sure every
Georgia family has a chance to have
children that is near and dear. And this
is a huge uh win for him this session.
And both of those were bipartisan. So,
you're feeling good about those two in
particular, the school safety and the
IVF, too. two bills out of how many
hundreds that that the legislature took
up this session. Uh, Donna, and you
know, um, uh, th those were, you know,
well-intentioned efforts and certainly
should be applauded for, uh, uh, for the
intent there. But, you know, my feeling
of this session is just, uh, I've been
calling it the onion session because
it's just, uh, very little of it is
sweet. We're not talking about a Videlia
onion. Uh, it mo most of it is just
pungent and bitter. Um the the
Republicans this session just focused on
culture war issues. You talk about those
two in particular. Um at the same time
that those bills passed, they took a
bill that would have uh given teachers
payraises, turned it into an anti-dei
uh bill, took a bill that would have uh
created a school uh supply tax holiday,
turned it into a gun and ammo tax
holiday. Um and uh of course we have to
talk about the RIFFA bill um which uh
you know is is is going to turn Georgia
into a place to hate back to a place to
hate. And the thing that I'm worried
about you know we talked about the IVF
bill and wanting to encourage families
in Georgia. My husband and I are going
through the adoption process right now
and bills like this will make it harder
for thousands of LGBTQ families in
Georgia to adopt a child right here in
this state. Yeah. So despite that, you
you still feel overall your filling on
the session is not good. Bitter, Don,
bitter. Bitter. When you said onions, I
thought you were going to say it has
layers. It sort of had layers, right?
You could have peeled away a little bit
of what happened this session. To me, it
was a sweet idea. Yeah. Okay. Onion. A
sweet
idea. Look, it's not just about cultural
war issues. Those do predominate in
every general assembly legislature in
the country. It is something that's part
and parcel of American politics. But
this session was so much more. Georgia's
got a tax rate cut. They are going to
get a tax refund. $500 if you're
married, 250 if you're single, put into
your bank account. We got hurricane
Helen relief for many communities in
this state. But
the tier one issue that is a huge
economic win for Georgia was Governor
Kent tort reform effort. It will protect
jobs. It will protect common sense in
this state by limiting these jackpot
juries that are simply unaffordable and
make it hard to do business in Georgia.
If you're living, if you're in a high
crime area, even just in the same zip
code, the retailers there, the gas
stations there that our uh residents
depend on. They can't afford the
insurance in those places. It's it it
hurts low-income Georgians. It's not
just something that um is a giveaway to
the rich. Okay. Your idea, your thoughts
on tort reform. I have a lot of ideas.
You spend a whole hour talking about the
tort bill. I was You're an attorney. So,
I was down at the capital a lot this
session with the trial lawyers uh on
this bill. And you know, um certainly
everyone can complain that um inflation
is too high, that our insurance rates
are too high. that tax that uh uh tax
rebate that pass. You know, who doesn't
want $500 more dollars in their pocket?
I certainly will take it, but um that
was a loss, a missed opportunity to
spend and invest uh uh billions of
dollars into our economy. And the tort
reform bill, the insurance commissioner
testified before the legislature and
said, "This will not lower insurance
rates." So, what are we doing here?
Yeah, Donna, I think we saw the House
leaders come out after the tort reform.
Obviously, one vote margin. This was not
an easy sale in there. It took a lot of
leg work and shoulder grease from
Governor Kemp and Speaker Burns to get
it done. But we we saw leaders come out
and say, "We want to see insurance rates
come down. You told us that this would
get us there. We are watching. We will
hold you accountable." And I think
that's going to be a great metric to
judge this law by. Well, we have
Governor Kemp available right now. So,
we're we're going to talk more about
this in a moment. We are happy to
welcome to the show the Georgia Governor
Brian Kemp. Good evening, sir. and
thanks for joining us for a few minutes.
Busy night.
Hey, great great to be back with you.
Happy signing die. Thank you. I want to
start with what you told or you plan to
tell those in the chambers this evening.
I guess you haven't talked to them yet.
No, we're fixing to go do that here in
just a little bit when everybody gets
back from their dinner break. I know
they're going to have a busy rest of the
night, but I'm looking forward to
getting in there and thanking the
members of the general assembly for a
great legislative session. I mean, we
have had some really tough issues that
we have worked on and debated, but I
think it's been done in a a really open,
transparent, fair way where everybody
had their say, and that's the way it
should be. Uh, obviously from my
perspective, we've had had a great
session. Uh they passed a great budget
today and so I'm looking forward to the
rest of the night and also the rest of
the year. Okay. We've been talking about
it here in the studio, but one of your
big priorities was to get tort reform
passed. You did that. How how are you
feeling right now about that goal being
accomplished when you were on the show
last year? You told us you were going
for it and and you did. Yeah.
Well, very very excited to get that done
as y'all were just talking about. very
very close vote, tough debate, very
tough issue. People have been trying to
get this done for, you know, really the
last 5 years. Uh, you know, in modern
times and really over the last 20 years,
there hasn't been a whole lot done. So,
it's a it's a tough issue to tackle. Uh,
but I think all the leaders in the
general assembly felt like we had to do
this. I know from my perspective I felt
like it was the one thing that was
really hurting our business environment
here and that other states were using
this against us because they have taken
action on tort reform and so you know
our main thing was to stabilize the
marketplace that was out there people
cannot continue to live with you know 15
to 30% premium increases every year is
killing small business people killing
working Georgians out there and uh so
tour reform you know what we did I think
will help stabilize the market and we're
going to continue to watch that, you
know, as we get out of session. All
right. So, we've heard some people
talking about this. Is there a
possibility possibility you'll want to
see insurance reform next year?
Well, I know there's a lot of members of
the general assembly that were very
concerned about some of the insurance
companies and, you know, wanted to take
a look at that. I kept asking people the
whole session, hey, bring me something.
You know, if you want to legislate that,
bring me the language. I'm I'm open to
talking to all sides on these issues to
stabilize costs, but also to open up
markets. I mean, we got small business
people out there, entrepreneurs, uh, and
others that can't even get insurance
because of the way the market was here
and the way the the legal environment
was here. And so, we wanted to bring
some parity, transparency, and fairness
to that issue. Now, if people want to
look to the insurance companies, I'm
open to to talking to them about how
they want to do that. But my message to
the in insurance companies is uh we we
did what we think was right. I think
they're very supportive of that. And so
now we're looking for them to get into
this marketplace and have more
competition which will help stabilize
prices. And so that's something
certainly I'll be looking at in the
months ahead. Okay. On another issue,
given that the budget relies heavily on
federal funding and we still don't know
where things are going to fall out when
the state in the state when it comes to
money, do you think there will be a need
for a special session to deal with the
budget at all?
Yeah, I think it's very very very
premature to be talking about special
sessions when we hadn't even ended this
one yet. uh in regards to what's going
on in the federal government, whether
it's Doge, other things that uh the
Congress is doing on ending ending COVID
funding. I mean, look, they have to do
those type things. We cannot continue to
have the levels of spending in this
country, especially things that were
related to CO that quite honestly when
you look at the way the state of Georgia
has performed, I mean, we haven't been,
you know, relying on those things for
over the last two years. So, you know, I
think they're making the right moves to
make sure that they worry and get down
our debts and our deficits, uh, which
will help bring down interest rates and
not burden our children and our
grandchildren in the future. And I can
assure you that we have continued to
budget conservatively conservatively in
our state uh even with this bud budget.
But we're also putting money back in our
taxpayers pockets with a another billion
dollar tax refund that's going to send
$500 to the average family out there
that's been paying taxes. We're lowering
our corporate tax rate. we're lowering
our uh personal tax rate to continue to
keep more money in Georgian's pocket so
that they can fight the high cost
environment that we've been over the
last four years. And hopefully we're
going to see that continue to to go down
and have a better better days ahead uh
financially. So, I'm very optimistic
about that, especially in the state of
Georgia with the economic development,
the jobs that we're creating here, the
amount of investments been historic over
the last three years. So, uh, we're
we're positioned as well as any state in
the country to weather what whatever
goes on in the US or the world economy.
I know you said this this evening isn't
over yet, but I do want to know if
you're already looking toward next year
at all, like you talked last year about
tort reform for this year. Anything for
next year?
Yeah, I'm not I'm not looking forward to
uh I'm not looking forward yet to to
next year. I'm looking forward to next
year. But, uh, look, we had a big agenda
this year. We had a lot to get done. Uh,
so we'll, you know, get this session
done with tonight, go into bill review,
uh, and make sure that we're signing or
or potentially vetoing bills that would
be bad for our citizens. And then, you
know, then we'll start looking on what
we're going to do uh, next year, but a
lot different than we were in this
position uh, this time last year,
talking about reform and having to focus
on it in the next legislative session.
Thankfully, we got that done along with
a lot of other good things and uh we've
had a great legislative session. Well, I
know that you are going to go talk to
each chamber uh and and thank them for
everything and they'll be happy to hear
from you, but I want to thank you for
coming to see us first. I appreciate you
talking with us, Governor.
Great to be back with you. Have a good
night. Thank you. You too.
All right, then. So, a lot to cover
there. And actually, you got us rolling,
both of you did, ahead of time on that.
Uh, so he he feels really good about
tort reform. We knew we knew he did. We
didn't get your full opinion on tort
reform. Did you say enough? It was
interesting because Donna, you asked him
about insurance reform next year, which
of course the speaker uh and some house
leaders have already uh called for. Uh,
and it was interesting to me what what
Governor Kim just said because he said
that he would that we would talk to the
insurance companies and see what they
wanted. Um, and that's exactly what we
did with the with this tort reform bill.
Uh, gave a you know give away uh what uh
President Trump calls a multi-billion
dollar insurance bailout um like when it
passed in Florida um to the industry. So
what we should be focusing on is the
everyday Georgians whose insurance rates
are too high. Uh tort reform is not the
answer. Insurance reform is. And you're
filling on insurance reform. Look, he
did not say the insurance company should
bring me language to look at. He said
legislators should bring him language to
look at because he heard legislators
talking about does this impact the cost
of insurance? Does it bring it down? I
think that is the metric by which this
law will be judged. I don't know that
we're going to know in the next 6
months, but within two years we'll know.
We do know that Georgia is an outlier.
And this is my real problem with Matt's
argument is we're hearing from retailers
with footprints across the southeast.
And they're saying that the cost and
number of lawsuits in Georgia is
outpacing all the other states combined.
And most of them are in Cobb, Fulton,
Gwynette, right here in the metro
Atlanta area. That had to get stopped.
We heard we saw regional businesses
saying stay out of Georgia. Don't have a
footprint there. The legal liability is
too high and these juries are just
passing out jackpots. We just saw
another $2 billion jury verdict here
last week against Bayer because of a
roundup case. Utterly ridiculous. Okay.
So, we we had that answered. You're
you're feeling on insurance reform,
though. Are you are you okay with
looking at that? Absolutely. I think we
just heard from the governor that he's
fine with it as well. Oh, look. Look,
this the rhetoric around this wasn't
made up. It was not a false flag. This
is about bringing relief in insurance
costs to Georgians and to Georgia
businesses. We want lowincome areas to
have drugstores and and gas stations and
grocerers. We want them to have all
that, but we and we want businesses to
come here knowing that they're going to
be treated fairly. If they're negligent,
they're still going to get sued. They're
still going to pay out a lot. So you see
more businesses coming in because
Georgia's been doing pretty good in
terms he's been doing great but we heard
the governor himself right there. The
governor himself just said we've seen
businesses backing off because of our
litigation climate. This will change
that. Okay. Want to talk about something
else I asked him about and that is the
budget and the possibility of a special
session. We've heard it from people.
What are your thoughts in terms of what
we're hearing out of Washington and some
of the cutbacks? you know, they always
uh have the opportunity to to call a
special session, and I know the governor
uh any governor, not just this governor,
would be reluctant to call one unless
it's absolutely necessary. Of course, he
put a special session on the table in
his state of the state speech uh this
year, but that was for tort reform uh uh
which has passed. So, it'll be
fascinating to to follow that and see um
how Governor Kemp navigates President
Trump and his administration. I talked
to a Democrat today who thinks it's
going to happen. So, I don't think it
will. You don't tell us about that. No,
I there's no appetite. Legislators don't
want to come back. This is a part-time
legislature. These people run
businesses, uh, have families back home.
It's very disruptive to have to come
back here. And look, we've got a huge
surplus right now. The governor's got
discretionary funds that can keep the
state moving ahead. It's a problem they
can wait until next year if, and this is
it's all theoretical, if there's massive
funding cuts from the federal government
coming to Georgia. We don't know just
exactly yet what that looks like, but I
don't see a scenario where they have to
come back. Nobody nobody wants that.
When when when when Kent made that
threat, you could just hear the groans
spread through the entire uh House
chamber. It's been a long few months and
um one of the issues we didn't discuss
earlier that the uh that the speakers
talked about and that was the
transgender bills that we saw this year.
Your comments on that? You know, it was
uh you know, I I spoke about this
earlier that the Republicans really
focused this session on the culture
wars. And it was interesting to me as a
former member of of the Georgia House uh
under Speaker David Rston. Um uh that
chamber always was the firewall really
against the far right fever dream um
that was that's been infecting the
Republican party uh for so long. And I
think what we saw this session was uh
unfortunately the Republican leadership
just knocked that bulldozed that wall
right down and just shoveled all of the
those horrible bills right through right
through the house. There was more of a
collaborative um process between the two
chambers, right? There was a lot of
agreement on those transgender bills,
that's for sure, because and on a lot of
others, too, on many issues and and I
think they're going to uh they passed
record numbers of bills in both chambers
during crossover day. So, you're seeing
a lot of reduction out of this session.
When it comes to these transgender
bills, uh Democrats made a huge
political miscalculation when they
marched out of the House chamber against
a bill that bans taxpayerf funed
transgender surgeries for prisoners.
This is something that you you don't
need the poll. It's going to be 90% and
I don't know. I think that the 10%
probably don't didn't understand the
question that they were being asked. You
know, it's an overwhelming support from
Georgians for what they're doing here.
Why Democrats would choose that issue
when it makes them look so extreme on
what Matt called a culture war issue.
Culture war issues are something that
drive votes. And Democrats told
Georgians, "We don't share your values."
That's what that's what they said this
session on those issues. Okay. You're
president of the interim president of
the Democratic Party. Chair chair,
please don't promote me to anything.
Don't give me more authority. Uh no,
look, the uh the the Democrats walked
out in that in that moment. And I think
it was more that for for that caucus, it
was more just about the culmination of
of everything that has been coming down
the pike uh this session. one one
horrible bill after another after
another after another after another. And
it got to a point where um uh the the
Democratic caucus felt like it needed to
stand up and and uh show some solidarity
with this community that has been under
attack from day one. Okay. Well, we're
rolling right now. I hate to stop this,
but we need to take a break. So, coming
up, interviews with Democratic
leadership in both the House and the
Senate on this special one-hour siny die
lawmaker show. The House is back in
session, by the way. This is the 55th

This is amazing. Well, I'm excited now.

You think I'm joking, but look at this.
It did really happen.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
History teaches us to honor the past.

When you look back, you're like, "Wow,
that was pretty special." This is

course of history. You're charged with
keeping these stories alive.
The Georgia Senate back in action for
the night in what could be a long
evening, but we'll keep you up to date
on what's going to happen. Welcome back
to Lawmakers. We're having a special
one-hour siny die show wrapping up the
55th year of lawmakers on GPB. And
joining me in the studio is Republican
Strategist Brian Robinson and the chair,
the interim chair of the Democratic
Party of Georgia, Matt Wilson. Thank you
so much for being here. We're going to
head right now back out to Sarah where
she has the minority leader in the
House, uh, Carolyn Hugley.
Thank you, Donna. And thank you, Leader
Hugley, for being here with us tonight.
My pleasure. This is your first session
as minority leader. Can you tell me how
it's been going and any reflections?
It's been a fast and furious year, but
I'm so very proud of our House
Democratic Caucus. We're 80 members
strong and our members have had a great
time this year. We've worked really hard
on on really some really fabulous
issues. But at the end of the day, we're
disappointed that uh a lot of the things
that we wanted to do were not uh looked
at or heard this year. The session
turned into Trump tort and everything
trans. Uh but our constituents wanted us
to look at our agenda which was uh to
create opportunity for Georgians to
live, to learn, and to earn. Thank you
so much. And uh speaking of everything
trans, yesterday there was a pretty
coordinated demonstration by the
Democratic Party against SB185, which
would essentially ban gender affirming
care in prisons. Can you talk to me a
little bit about that
effort? At the end of the day, what were
we talking about? Five people is all
they could come up with, five people. Uh
and they make this the number one
priority. And we're we were on the 39th
day of our session. We had not passed
our budget. Uh we had not finished a lot
of things as it relates to education.
None of the things that we worked on
today uh had been done. But yet we felt
like that we were wasting the time, the
valuable time that we have here. We only
have 40 days here. uh and our citizens
sent us here to tackle the real issues
and not to work on phantom issues or
madeup issues as that was. If we were
going to look at uh prisons, let's make
sure the doors lock, that you can lock
the cells. Let's make sure that you have
the staff that's needed. Not talking
about maybe five out of all of the
people that we have incarcerated fall
into this category. And is there
anything that you're hoping to see pass
in the final hours of the session today?
My hope is that we have nothing else bad
come through in the last final hours. Uh
we've done our constitutionally mandated
thing which is to pass a budget and
we're looking to get to the end of the
session without any other major
disruptions to the people of Georgia so
that when the legislature is out the
people of Georgia can be safe again.
Right. Thank you so much leader Hugley
and Donna. back to you in the studio.
We'll be back to you in just a moment.
So, she see um leader Hugley talked a
little bit about the fact that she
doesn't expect much to happen. The big
bills have actually gone through. So,
tonight maybe a little unless there's a
surprise from that you guys may know
about her. I don't know. Right now,
anything could happen as we say. No,
literally. So, we we still have four
hours more to go. So, yes. And and they
are they are going to be clocking
through bills. You do not know what's
going to get s inserted into conference
committees. You don't know what powerful
legislator is going to be on one of
those conference committees who's got a
pep project that has gotten no traction
with their colleagues and they slip it
in something that their a bigger bill
that their colleagues do want. So it's
you never really know the fact that you
don't wake up on Saturday morning and
know we really don't know until the
middle of next week what is in some of
these bills. It's kind of a crazy system
frankly. Yeah. you're shaking your head
cuz right now we don't know what
negotiations are taking place either.
That's right. That's right. There's a
lot of negotiations going on uh behind
the scenes in between the chambers uh
and of course with the governor's office
as well, but um we we we already know
we've talked a lot about what has
happened and what may happen, but we
certainly know what hasn't and isn't
going to happen um in this session.
another session where uh Medicaid
expansion was not even really on the
table. Um uh despite the fact, you know,
we know uh Georgia spent over 40, you
know, billion a million dollars, excuse
me, um to ensure 6,000 people when we
can expand, fully expand Medicaid and
ensure close to half a million people uh
in Georgia. That was left uh by the
wayside. Um but we'll see. Maybe they'll
surprise us and pass Medicaid here in
the last hour. Oh, that'd be a big
surprise. Yeah, I I think Governor Kemp
made it very clear. You're asking about
next year. I think Governor Kemp's made
it clear as long as he lives on West
Paces Ferry, there will not be Medicaid
expansion in Georgia. Okay, we'll talk
about talk about more in just a moment
because now we're going to head back to
Sarah at the capital with the Democratic
Senator Josh McLaren.
Thank you, Donna and Senator McLuren. We
appreciate you being here with us
tonight. Absolutely. So, before we
start, I noticed your pin when you
walked over. Can you tell me a little
bit about that? Yes, this is a big pen,
big bipartisan pen. It says doing it for
America and it's a picture of me and
Senator Russ Goodman. We're both
enthusiastically committing ourselves to
service service this evening. So, I
figured the pen would commemorate it
well. All right. Thank you. And so, how
has your session been so far? What are
some of the highlights for you? Look,
this has been a wild session. And if you
ask any legislator, there's sort of a
big picture and a small picture, which
is like what are they working on? Big
picture, this has been a really tough
session. There have been some really
regressive bills. I think even members
of the majority party have been
surprised by how culture war oriented
and regressive some of the bills have
been just to be very blunt. Uh and so I
mourn actually with a lot of people uh
who think that there have been undue
attacks on teachers on the trans
community um and on civil rights in
general. However, that being said, I
have been working on some things this
session that I've been personally proud
of. Um I got a regulation on booting
passed uh both houses, House and Senate.
So, it's headed to the governor's desk.
I think that'll be the first uh
statewide booting regulation, that's
booting of cars to be very clear. I have
to annunciate clearly uh ever in the
state's history. And I've also worked on
uh funding for veterans uh and some
judiciary bills that I'm proud of. So,
for me, it's been a productive session,
but I but you know, my thoughts are with
the people who feel like uh this state
has taken a turn for the Trump. And so,
on late Wednesday evening, you were a
very vocal opponent of HP127, which
would ban DEI programs in Georgia
schools. Can you talk to me a little bit
about your stance on that? Yeah, that
bill is absurd. It may be the worst
legislation that I've ever seen in
history. The reason I say that is
because if one professor at the
University of Georgia were to teach that
the Holocaust happened, the entirety of
the University of Georgia would be
defunded of all state and federal money.
I'll say that again. If any professor
took as an official position that any
group has ever been harmed or
marginalized, uh you know, that's the
Holocaust, that's slavery, whatever, uh
all federal funding and state funding
would be withheld. It is a total red
meat culture war bill that the majority
passed to satisfy a base that has grown
to hate the letters DEI for for really
no reason. Um and so we just that kind
of move is not what the moderate
Republicans who voted uh for Republican
leadership want. This is the far-right
base that they're appealing to. And I
can tell you with certainty that the
Senate is hoping that the House does not
pass that bill because they know how bad
it is. And is there anything that you're
hoping to see pass um in the final hours
of the session today? Sure. I mean
there's still some good government
bills. I mean, that's that's the
contradiction of being in this place is
you can have a bill that's really crazy
that people are really not proud of, but
then on the other hand, you can have
good government bills that make life a
little bit easier. So, I'm I'm still
waiting on a judiciary bill that would
improve our backlog in our courts by
making cases go a little bit faster. So,
you again, you just got to stay focused
on the little wins you can get to make
life a little bit better for people. Uh,
and you got to fight where uh where you
need to. All right. Well, we'll have to
watch that bill. Thank you so much for
being here with us. Thank you, Sarah.
Appreciate it, Donna. Thanks so much,
Sarah. So, let's let's start where he
kind of left off on in terms of the DEI
bill. It was the the the information,
the language was added to a bill that
would have added sick days to teachers
who really need sick days after it
didn't make it for crossover day in the
Senate. So, talk about your feelings
about that. I have strong feelings about
this, Donna. um which may come as a
shock to you but um uh most people don't
know before I went to law school I
taught sixth grade um no I didn't math
and science and um so uh educators have
a very special place in my heart because
I know how hard their job is. Um, I used
to, uh, joke that, um, nothing prepared
me better for service in the Georgia
House than being a sixth grade teacher
because it's an exercise in persistence
and getting up every day and not taking
everything that's said to your face
personally. Um, so I thank those sixth
graders for preparing me for especially
middle school. Yeah, sixth graders. But
but this is just another example, Donna,
of how Republicans are not doing
anything to address those high costs
inflation that we were talking about
earlier. This is just another Senator
McLaren said it well, another red uh uh
um red meat bill thrown out to the base
um as we go into a critical election
year um which we should talk about some
critical statewide seats on the PSC this
year uh which Democrats are going to
have a great shot at. Um and going into
even more critical cycle uh next year. I
expect about this time next week we'll
have a whole bunch of campaign
announcements. Okay. Okay. anything that
you want to add to us. We'll we'll get
back to that in a moment. I just want to
hear what you have to say about the DEI
language added to the bill that dealt
with sick days and it's now in the
House, we believe tonight they'll vote
after the Senate. Well, we heard the the
chairman here and the senator talk about
red meat and I want to point out there
red herrings. Look, the idea that a
University of Georgia professor is going
to threaten the university's funding
because they teach that the Holocaust
happened is just so extraordinarily
outrageously false. There there's no one
watching this right now that believes
that is the case. No one. Not one
person, not even the senator who said it
believes that's the case. What this is
about is rooting out the left-wing
ideology that has been put into
curriculum from elementary, middle,
high, and and colleges across the
country. And now there is a backlash.
This all came out of COVID when parents
for the first time were hearing what
their kids were learning through the
computer. And you are seeing folks say
enough of this ideology. We're not
sending our kids to public school to be
fed liberal propaganda and to be taught
uh basically that our country is full of
shame. We should be proud Americans and
that's what this is about. And I I
disagree with the senator as well that
moderate Republicans disagree with this.
There are things that moderate
Republicans disagree with the MAGA part
of the party on. This isn't one of them,
right? uh the the Democrats and the left
who control cultural institutions simply
went too far and people got sick of it.
Okay, we're going to change gears a
little bit here because earlier today
when I talked to the governor, we talked
about the fact that he would be talking
to both chambers. Let's listen to him
right now. I believe he's in the house.
Thoughtful coordination between the
house, the senate, and my office has
benefited the people of our state and
put Georgia on a path to continued
prosperity and opportunity.
My hope is that we continue that
successful streak which will benefit
hardworking Georgians most of all. And
as this seventh session during my time
in office draws to a close, I want to
thank you all for your contributions and
your hard work. Marty, the girls, and I
are grateful for your service to our
fellow Georgians. Thank you all. Have a
great rest of the night and God bless
you.
All right, Governor Brian Kemp speaking
tonight, siny die to the members of the
Georgia House. I believe he now will
probably go on over to the Senate, but
we're going to right now go back to
Sarah at the capital and she's with
Senate Minority Whip, Senator Kim
Jackson.
Thank you, Don. Donna, and thank you,
Senator Jackson, for being here with me
tonight. So, can you start off by
walking me through some of the
highlights for the Democrats and for
yourself this session? Yeah, you know,
this has been a long session for us.
We've had to fight really hard against a
lot of really bad bills. Uh, but we also
continue to fight for good things. Uh,
we passed a child tax credit um this
year that I think will help some Georgia
families. Um, we continue to work to
make sure that people have education
fully funded based on the QBE. We wish
that we re-evaluated the QB uh scale,
but we're glad to fully full fully fund
that. Um, but it's been it's been a
tough it's been a tough session for us.
And so we saw several bills that would
have restricted transgender Georgians
passed the Senate this year and you were
vocally opposed to all them. Can you
talk to me a little bit about your
stance on that issue? Yeah, so my stance
is that all people in Georgia should be
treated equally and fairly that no
population and particularly a minority
population as small as transgendered
folks and trans gender children
specifically um should never be attacked
and pointed out. And so I've stood
really firmly on that. I am a member of
the LGBTQ community, but more
importantly, I'm very much invested in
no child feeling discriminated against,
no child being limited in terms of being
able to exercise their rights as
children to just play and have fun. And
are there any other reflections that you
have for this session as we head into
the final hours? Yeah, you know, I'm
really disappointed in my colleagues in
the Republican party. We had an
opportunity to really bring good things
to Georgians and we continue to have
people who are uncovered when it comes
to Medicaid and being able to have
access to insurance. We continue to have
families that are just struggling to
have access to child care and to have it
be affordable. Um, our TANF dollars are
not where they should be in terms of
people who are really low income being
able to have access to additional funds
so that they can just simply feed their
families and care well for their
families. You know, there's just a lot
that was left on the table that we could
have done to really help Georgians to
advance the ball. And instead, we've
been playing these games with trans
children. And um now we had a DEI bill
that passed out of the Senate that um
would greatly limit what people can do.
RIFFRA passed, a bill that we've been
fighting against for 10 years because it
legalizes discrimination. And so I'm I'm
deeply disappointed. We had an
opportunity to do good things and
instead my Republican colleagues chose
to throw red meat. All right. Well,
thank you so much for taking the time to
be here with us this evening. Have a
good evening, Donna. Thank you so much,
Sarah. I appreciate that. Well, earlier
this evening, Sarah did an interview
with House Majority Leader Chuck
Estration. Here it is.
Leader Upstation, thank you so much for
being here tonight. Yeah, thank you for
having me. A lot going on here at the
capital on Sonny D. So, plenty to talk
about. Absolutely. So, we've seen the
House pass hundreds of bills this
session. Can you explain some of your
highlights and the bills you're most
proud of? Sure. We've prioritized school
safety, ensuring that hurricane recovery
relief, uh tax cuts were part of uh the
discussion this year. Tor reform has
been a major issue. Really, I think it
comes down to education, public safety,
and ensuring that Georgians are in the
best possible position to live, work,
raise a family. We're um we're focused
on common sense kitchen table issues.
and uh what are your biggest takeaways
from the session this year? Yeah, I
think the um success that we've had in
passing legislation that really means a
lot to Georgian. So, um uh $2 billion in
tax relief that's been passed. We've had
uh school safety legislation to ensure
that parents are aware of uh school
infrastructure improvements, mental
health care. Um we we've had uh you know
the hur hurricane Helen had a
devastating impact. So just my takeaway
is issues that really matter to
Georgians issues we were discussing in
January at the beginning of the
legislative session we followed through
on and passed and there's still some
time left this evening. Is there
anything else you're really hoping is
going to come up? Passing the budget was
huge. We had to do that and that
occurred earlier this afternoon. But
yes, I think we're going to continue to
see additional issues. Um and uh and
there's always some surprises here and
there on sunny die, but I'm I'm looking
forward to finishing strong this
evening. Absolutely. Well, thank you so
much for being here and talking with me.
Great. Thanks for having me.
All right. Thanks, Sarah. So, leader of
Stration, the last thing you talked
about was the budget. So, I wanted to
get into that. So, anything you want to
talk about in particular with the budget
that stands out for you? Obviously, a
one-time issue is Hurricane Helen, but
let's hope it's it's one time.
Obviously, there was tremendous damage.
we there's something we can't afford to
do every year, but this was something
that the legislature and the governor
really prioritized and hopefully it's
going to bring some relief to those
communities in South Georgia over into
the Augusta area. One thing that hasn't
gotten a lot of attention, but it's
significant is the amount of investment
that has gone into our prison system.
This is something that's gotten
bipartisan support. Our prison system
was in dire straits. These are some of
the deadliest, most dangerous prisons in
the entire country. Gangs are being run
out of these prisons. They're dropping
in cell phones. Gang uh leaders are able
to order hits, manage a drug operation,
all from within our state prisons.
They're woefully undermanned. They are
very dangerous. And look, it's very
difficult in politics to go make an
argument to taxpayers that their dollar
should go to people who have committed
crimes. No one wants to talk about that
too much, but there is a humanity
involved in some of this. People who
commit minor crimes shouldn't be
sentenced to a virtual death penalty.
And in some cases, with the amount of
murders that happen within the prison
system that has been the case. So, I
think that this is a monumental
investment. I think it's going to make
our prisons safer and hopefully make it
safer also for the people who work
there. No one wants to work in these
places. The pay is terrible, that work
is dangerous. So hopefully with higher
salaries, we can attract some good
people and we need safety in numbers. If
you only have a couple of guards, the
gangs in the prison can target them at
home and kill them, which we've actually
seen happen. As you you would agree that
this is a an issue nobody wants to talk
about, but it had to be dealt with this
session. Sure. Sure. Absolutely. And um
it's commendable that they that they
took that up. Um, you know, I think most
uh most people don't understand um how
the budget uh uh works um uh in the
legislature, but it really starts uh
with with the governor and and who's
elected as governor because um as Brian
well knows and Donnie, you know, well
well know, uh the governor uh selects
the economist who decides what the
future projections um for tax revenue
are going to be, which determines how
much money the legislature can actually
budget and What we've seen in successive
administrations is governors choosing
economists who are ultra conservative
who will uh uh have a very low budget
produ uh projection number knowing it's
going to be over that and the governor
gets to allocate this amount on top of
it that does not have to run through the
legislature. And that's why we continue
to have uh disinvestment uh and missed
opportunities in investment in in
various communities um uh uh that have
been starved over the last several
decades. Okay. I want to talk about the
Democratic Party of Georgia right now.
So we've seen a transition just what
this week earlier that um Representative
Nikima Williams has stepped down. So you
are interim chair at this point. Tell us
what's going on there. So, the
Democratic Party of Georgia is really um
evolving to meet the moment that we're
in. Uh we had a chair when um
Congresswoman Williams was uh serving as
a in a volunteer capacity. Obviously,
she's a member of Congress. Um so, she
was a a volunteer unpaid uh chair for
the state party. We are moving uh to a
uh a system of having a paid full-time
chair. Um kind of like a paid CEO. But
we also have a paid executive director
kind of like a COO. Um and so obviously
with her being uh my congresswoman in uh
in Congress, she could not uh do that
role and she has graciously stepped
aside so that we can accelerate this
transition. Uh so we will we actually
just yesterday Donna announced that the
election for that will be held in 30
days. Um and we already have several
candidates that are stepping forward,
but that'll be a paid full-time position
going forward. Is there a special
process in place for choosing? I
remember it was it a few years ago there
was it was kind of a public way of doing
it. So we have a uh a state committee of
uh a few hundred um Democrats that are
appointed from the county level uh who
come together and will elect the chair.
Okay. You alluded earlier to some
announcements coming up. So is there
something you want to tell us? I have no
announcement other than other than I
will not be the interim chair in 30 days
and I'm very much looking forward to
that. uh um uh about some elections
coming up. You know, it's it's a very
exciting. It's a very exciting time and
I do think um that this time next week
uh is when we'll see the slew of
campaign announcements uh once sin die
gles out today. It'll be interesting.
I've heard a lot of of names being
thrown around. We've seen a lot of names
already um in the in the media uh both
on both sides. um some names uh in
contention and then withdrawing from
contention um and some names we thought
were out of contention now saying that
they are in contention. So it'll be a
fascinating uh uh rest of the year.
Yeah, everybody was waiting for this day
to end before we hear some of the big
announcements. What are your thoughts on
what we might hear? Well, we know of
some already because they had to file
paperwork and that was it wasn't so much
of an announcement, but a a bureaucratic
uh demand that that they announced that
they're going to run with Chris Carr uh
running for governor, our current
attorney general. Uh State Senator Brian
Strickland announcing this week through
filing paperwork that he's going to run
to succeed. Carr, I think you're going
to see numerous state senators. We're
going to we're going to empty out the
state senate. I mean, uh, we're going to
need to go recruit a bunch of smart
Georgians to fill these these seats
because so many are running for higher
office. You're going to see, uh, some
running for the insurance commissioner.
I know, uh, Senator Larry Walker's
taking a look at that. Uh, insurance
commissioner John King is looking at
running for US Senate if Kemp doesn't
run. But, of course, Donna, on our side,
Kemp is the domino everyone is waiting
for to fall. Nothing can happen until he
tells us what he's going to do. Polls
show him beating Asaf by eight points.
He's obviously the best horse for
Republicans. Asaf is the most vulnerable
Democrat in the US Senate in this
election cycle. So, everybody wants Kim
to run. Kemp doesn't want to be in the
US Senate. He has been governor of
Georgia, the coolest job that there is.
It's a step down to go to the US Senate.
So, he would have to be strong armed
into that. I don't think he'll do it.
So, I I think you may see some of these
state senators looking at the lieutenant
governor's race like John F. Kennedy
who's the pro Tim and Greg Doazol from
coming to maybe look at that US Senate
race. They've been looking at the
lieutenant governor's race and of course
agriculture commissioner Tyler Harper
also like Bert Jones our lieutenant
governor very close to Trump and might
be looking at some other kind of office
to run for as well. But there's going to
be a lot of names there'll be some
sitting. We'll see next week people
holding fundraisers and that will tell
us what they're running for. What year
was it that you you ran for insurance
commissioner? right 2022 and we saw a
lot of people leave the legislature.
Well, we'll we're going to have to wait
and see. I want to thank you both for
being here. It was really fun and really
good information. So, thank you so much
and happy 55th birthday. Thank you.
Yeah, that does it for lawmakers for
2025 this session, the 55th season of
this show. Tune in to GPB for continuous
coverage of state politics on gpb.org.
And as we bid you for farewell, we leave
you with some behind the scenes images
of our crew. Have a good night.
