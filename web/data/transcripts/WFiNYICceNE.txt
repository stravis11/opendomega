TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. I want to thank you all for being here today. I'm joined by
community advocates and organizations such as Georgia National Organization
for Women, Feminist Center for Reproductive Liberation, Planned Parenthood
Southeast, Amplified Georgia Collaborative, and Sister Song National Women of
Reproductive Justice, as well as Black Mama Matters Alliance, and Indivisible.
I wish we were gathered here under better circumstances, but the truth is what's happening
right now in a hospital room at Emory Healthcare should shake every single one of us to our
core.
Adriana Smith was declared brain debt in February, a legal and medical determination of death.
And since then, her bodily functions have been sustained by machines in an attempt to continue
the pregnancy.
to her family. The hospital told them that this was required under Georgia law, but that
would be an unusual and deeply troubling interpretation of her six-week abortion
ban. Women deserve the ability to give informed medical consent, and when they cannot, their
families must be empowered to make decisions with full information and without fear. Families
deserve clarity, providers deserve protection, and Georgians deserve laws that prioritize
our health, dignity, and basic humanity,
not confusion, delay, and fear.
Republicans have made clear.
They won't repeal this cruel and unpopular law,
and repeal is the only way to give women access
and give them the care they need.
And without repeal,
Georgians deserve to know what care they can access.
We do not know what this law demands,
and that is a failure of leadership.
I have sent a formal request to Governor Camp asking him
to use his authority to get an official legal opinion
from Attorney General Chris Carr.
That's not politics.
That is the actual process.
But the governor who signed this law into effect
won't even acknowledge the question.
He won't answer Georgia families.
He won't answer doctors.
He won't answer me.
And he certainly won't answer the people of Georgia.
But let me tell you what we do know.
We know that the sponsor of this law
says it's working exactly as intended.
That this woman being kept on machines
is the logical results of their legislation.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General's office
issues a press statement saying that the law
doesn't actually require this outcome.
These are not small contradictions.
These are life and death contradictions.
And then that's why I've sent a formal letter
to Governor Camp asking him to do what only he can.
request a binding legal opinion from the AG
that brings clarity to this crisis.
And I've asked four basic but urgent questions,
questions at hospitals, doctors and families
across Georgia need answered.
Number one, under Georgia law,
including the current abortion statute,
is a hospital legally required
to maintain a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support
in order to continue gestation of the fetus.
Number two, what are the precise definitions
that constitute a medical emergency under this law.
Number three, when the law allows abortion
in cases where the fetus is incompatible with life,
what conditions actually meet that threshold
and why hasn't the state made that explicit?
Number four, how does this law affect legal standing
of advanced directives and end-of-life planning
for pregnant Georgians?
These questions are not theoretical, they're urgent
because as long as this law remains vague,
We will continue to see families traumatized,
providers criminalized, and patients left behind.
Doctors are being forced to make impossible choices.
Families are trapped in grief, grief, and fear.
And women are dying, just like Amber Nicole Thurman,
who has denied care for over 20 hours
and died on the operating table.
Just like Candy Miller, who died after managing
her own abortion at home because she was too afraid
to go to the hospital.
The governor's own maternal mortality review committee
has called these debts preventable.
Is this the Georgia that we want?
We are calling on the governor to do his job.
Request a formal opinion from the AG
and tell the people of Georgia what this law actually means.
We're not going to sit quietly while women are used as test
cases for law.
No one will take responsibility for.
In the buck stops with the governor,
he signed his bill into law.
Now it's time for him to face the consequences
of what is doing to real families.
This law does harm to Georgians every day,
and we deserve clarity, we deserve compassion,
and we deserve better than silence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next, we will have Kasey Muroshak speak,
and she will share her personal story
about how Georgia's abortion law affected her.
Good morning, and thank you for having me here today.
My name is Casey Marishak, and I'm here today not just as a grieving mother, but as a voice
for women who have suffered in silence because of the unintended consequences of George's
abortion laws.
What happened to me is not rare.
It is not an outlier.
It's happening every day.
One in four women experienced a miscarriage, over half of them need medical intervention
to complete it safely.
This is not just a political issue, it's a medical one.
And yet what I went through proved just how dangerous it is when politics interfered
with health care.
me to share my story with you. We lost our baby. We found out on a Thursday morning in March,
just one day after our gender reveal, that our daughter no longer had a heartbeat,
but she had been given a name, so I earned a cold Christian. In a matter of seconds,
we went from preparing to welcome her into our lives to try to figure out how to say goodbye.
My doctor was sympathetic, but because of the restrictive abortion laws,
My care was limited to a list of abortion clinics, no follow-up plan, no guidance, and no support.
Over the next two days, I called clinic after clinic continuously having to repeat and relive
that soil did not have a heartbeat. My insurance recommended me go to the emergency department
because of increasing septic symptoms, so I did. I spent seven hours there in pain,
and grief and in shock, only to be discharged with no treatment, no resolution, and no care.
However, we did learn I had a condition called placenta previa, meaning that if my body
had tried to complete the miscarriage on its own, I could have hemorrhaged.
I could have lost my ability to have children, and I could have lost my life, and yet still
nobody helped.
I was forced to walk around for more than a week carrying soyer who was no longer alive.
Our healthcare system had no place for my situation because the restrictive abortion
law ties the hands of medical professionals.
Our daughter had a name.
She had a family who prayed for her who loved her before she ever arrived.
Her feet will never walk this earth.
Her hands will never dig in the dirt in our backyard, but she left her mark on our hearts.
And now she's giving me the courage to speak to you today.
My story is not unique.
I'm not alone.
I'm one of many women who have been failed by a system that does not see us, doesn't
protect us and does not trust us to make decisions about our own bodies.
The government does not belong in women's healthcare.
It does not belong in our grief, our decisions, or in our exam rooms.
This issue will touch every family in some way someday.
When it does, I hope things are different.
I hope your daughter, your sister, your niece or your friend is treated with the care,
respect, and the urgency that I was denied because I was failed by policies that value
politics over people by a system that does not trust women to know their bodies, their
pregnancies, or their pain. I am not here to debate the morality of abortion. I am here
to speak to the urgent need for clear medical exceptions that protect women in crisis.
Doctors need legal clarity and the freedom to act quickly when a woman's health is at risk,
not after she is on the verge of sepsis. I refuse to stay silent. I refuse to let
at Sawyer's story and in a hospital hallway
or an unanswered phone call.
Her name will not be buried quietly.
She mattered and through her I have found my voice
and I will continue to use it.
I will keep speaking until change is no longer a plea
but as a promise.
Because if this can happen to me,
it can happen to anyone.
And I will not stop until women's healthcare
becomes the priority.
Thank you.
Yes.
We're not here brought here today for one particular case, but for a multitude of situations
that happened throughout Georgia, one of which you just literally heard because of this
draconian law that this legislature passed.
What we've learned and frankly both Democratic caucuses understood is that this is what
happens when you deprive women of their autonomy and their choices. What these
situations tell us is that more women and more Georgia families will endure
these uncertainties, pain and suffering. So let's be clear first and foremost we
need to give women their autonomy back and repeal HB481. That is always the
goal of this caucus and House Democratic Caucus and quite frankly the people of
Georgia. As that fight continues, we must stand with Senator Parks and demand
clarification from our Governor and Attorney General, what rights do women
have under this law?
Georgians have been asking this question. We as legislators have been asking this
question, and the people standing here today have been asking this question, yet
Georgia's leadership has stayed silent. This morning, I stand with everyone here to
We announced to tell their attorney general to answer the calls of these women.
Answer the call of the families of this state.
Answer the call is so deftly needed.
It is his responsibility and the governor's responsibility to give us these answers.
Whether through a formal legal opinion or other means, these answers must come.
The women of this state and families of this state demand this.
As my duty, as Senate Minority Leader,
is the duty of the Senate in the House
to prevent deaths, to prevent suffering,
to prevent the heart wrenching stories,
one of which you heard today.
We say we are here to do the people's business.
Well, the people need answers.
It's time to get to business.
With that, I will let our representative
Park Cannon speak.
Thank you.
Well, that's it.
Thank you.
It's transition.
I'd like to thank you all for being here
and particularly thank Casey for sharing her story.
She is a powerful speaker who speaks to the impacts of delayed care in Georgia.
And this is a ripple effect that happens across our state.
My name is Park Cannon.
I'm proud to serve as the Secretary of the House Minority Caucus.
And outside of the legislature, I am a full spectrum doula.
That means I help people whether they want to be pregnant or not, whether they can sustain
a pregnancy to term or not.
And many times in those decision making moments, it's not about the government and it's not
about God, it's about science and medicine.
And today what we're experiencing in Fulton County is a medical travesty and is a concern
that all legislators should carry because we see the through line of House Bill 481
through so many different reproductive injustices happening.
As the legislator for the area where Grady Hospital is, I want to thank the professionals
there for doing above and beyond care, because now they're the only level one trauma center
in this area.
Since Wallstar has closed, also within District 58, we have been looking around the state
to figure out what happens when hospitals close, and what happens when there is medical
confusion based on the law.
Additionally, with Emery University Hospital Midtown being in District 58, it has been very
clear that our constituency want to see justice as served.
That specifically means that medical professionals are able to do what they need to do and that
their surviving family is able to grieve privately.
We ask for the privacy for her family, but we also ask for the repeal of House Bill 481.
So if you're here today, I want to transport you back to the day that House Bill 481
was passed.
Here in this chamber, many of us in the legislature clamored and cried.
We said there will be vague circumstances that take place because of this law.
the law was passed, thankfully based on a number of these organizations here like Sister
Song and Planned Parenthood and Feminist, we took it all the way to the Georgia Supreme
Court and we said this law is vague, not just vague because what happens if somebody is
in an HOV lane and pregnant and gets pulled over, but because of medical travesties like
this one.
So today we asked for the legislature to consider a full repeal of House Bill 481, which put
this ban into effect and created the vagueness that we see, and to enact the Reproductive
Freedom Act, which you will hear about.
Thank you very much.
Next we will have Quodulent Jackson speak.
She will be closing out this press conference.
She is with the Feminist Center for Reproductive Liberation.
Thank you very much for having me here today.
My name is Kwajaland Jackson,
and I'm the Executive Director of Feminist Center
for Reproductive Liberation.
And I first want to offer my sincere condolences
to all who have lost a loved one to medical mistreatment,
neglect, denial of care, or obstetric violence
that are hurting today, to the families of those whose names we know and to those
that we don't know. You are not alone in your grief. We mourn with you. We have
long endured a system in this country where the needs of our communities have
been ignored or dismissed. Where our pain and suffering is simultaneously made
invisible and made a spectacle for mass consumption. At Feminist Center for
Reproductive Liberation, we not only provide compassionate care that people want
and need in our clinic, including abortion care, but we also fight in these
very halls to demand that care people deserve they're able to access
everywhere. That means we fight to ensure that people can safely end the
pregnancies that they don't want, and we fight so that people can survive the
pregnancies that they do want. And everything in between, we fight so that OBGYNs,
midwives, doulas, promatoras, nurses can practice the compassionate care
that they are trained to do without fear obstruction or confusion. We fight so
that birth in Georgia can be a joyous occasion that people desire and not a
frightening and deadly risk that has it has been true for black women for so
long. With the proponents of this dangerous law failed to understand is that
The bodily autonomy is life, self-determination is life, compassionate care is life, allowing
clinicians to act in the best interest of their patients is life, reproductive liberation
is life.
We are fighting for our lives, and we are fighting for the lives of those who oppose us as well.
If you want to save lives, you will repeal this inhumane ban.
Thank you.
Good.
Thanks so much.
That is the end of our press conference.
If you have questions, we are open to answering.
I mean we're concerned with the fact that this law is mandating care with
medical consent. A woman should consent to medical care, and if they can't, their next
to kin should consent to medical care. And at the end of the day, if this situation,
this family should have had the ability to have a conversation and not have this mandated
on them. And if this were to happen ever again, we want our families, we want women to
be able to have bodily autonomy and make their decisions for themselves, and that decision
should be between their doctor and them.
All we're saying is that with this being a second case like this that's ever really
taken place in our country, when we look at the similarities between the medical circumstances
And we see there's a time ticking right now.
And so many of us are curious as to what is the next course
of action for these medical professionals,
which is why we're gathered here today to say time is taking.
We need to figure out how this law impacts care.
Any more questions?
Thank you very much.
