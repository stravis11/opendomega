31st house District representative Emory
Donahue representative donohoo
thank you Mr Speaker
have the privilege of introducing my
friend
Pastor Jeff Appling he's otherwise known
as Pastor a but first of all let me
introduce his beautiful most talented
musician and what a beautiful voice Miss
Lisa and Miss Lisa Appling
they they were married at three years
old so they've been here quite a while
even though they don't look like that
we uh you know I have the privilege of
visiting this church
and when I go there probably several
times a year it's because my middle
daughter Megan Seth my son-in-law we
have Levi we have Selah and Becca that
love the Grove then my son Josh Holly
Kai and Haven love the Grove I attend
another church but every time I can
sneak away I go to The Grove
now with that being said to give you a
little history The Grove is in Maysville
Georgia it was founded in 1802.
Thomas Jefferson was president and I can
see
Pastor Ray riding that mule with a straw
hat waving holding the Bible as he
traveled the dirt roads to spread the
word of God
and that's a joke there but he's been
there 33 years
so with that I want you to put your seat
belt on and buckle up because right now
as not a very good golfer just in case
he hits one in the weeds I'm going to
give him a chartreuse golf ball but it's
a Titleist Pro-V
and just in case he wants to hit it
straight down the Fairway we have a
tightness Pro B and it's ready to Tee It
Up Pastor so here you go thank you sir
thank you thank you yes thank you
speaker
well I played golf yesterday so I need
both of these based off what I played so
it's an honor for my wife and I to be
here we are grateful to God I am not the
founding pastor of the Grove but I
I did go there in 1990 Lisa and I were
26 years old and we began our journey in
the pastorate it's our first pastor and
we've stayed and we've enjoyed it we
understand the value of planting
somewhere and staying somewhere and
working hard
and we're grateful to God for you
we pray for you
I understand leadership I have the
opportunity of working with a fellow
many of you may have heard of Dr John
Maxwell
and for 20 years I've worked with an
organization called equip alongside of
pastoring
and equip is just uh it's a name that
simply means encouraging qualities
undeveloped in people
and we do it all over the world
and God is blessed and we've had
opportunities to travel a lot the one
thing that I do know and understand
fully
is that you in this room sit
in a leadership seat
and a lot of people from a distance look
at leadership and think is fun they kind
of think it's a lot of uh uh they think
it's beautiful you know it's like oh I'd
love to do that
until they sit in the seat
and when you sit in the seat you
understand real quick there's a lot of
pressure a lot of responsibility and the
one thing that each of you are called
upon to do
is to make is making decisions
and that is a responsibility that you
have
you know the Bible says that God so
loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son
that whosoever believes in Him should
not perish
but have everlasting life
and Lisa and I were talking about that
this morning on the way in and we said
isn't it really wonderful that we serve
a God that loves the whole world
doesn't matter what side of the aisle
you sit upon doesn't matter what race
you may be
we serve a God who loves you and we are
capable of loving one another because
God so loved us
but I understand that under in your
situation and even as a pastor for this
many years
we are called upon to make decisions and
when we make those decisions how many of
you know not Everyone likes our decision
the moment we make them I heard a little
story it said you know to dwell below
with the Saints we know
you know oh I'm in order to dwell above
with the Saints we know won't that be
glory but to work below with the people
we know that's another story
it's not always easy and not everybody
likes our decisions and we get that
but I thought if I had one thing to say
and basically when I came in they told
me you have one thing to say and sit
down I said okay I agree
the word of God says and we know
and we know this
that for those who love God
all things work together for good
for those who are called according to
God's purpose
the promise is given to those who love
God
that God will take the decisions you
make
and God will work them in our nation and
God will work them in our state
both Lise and myself have enjoyed living
in Georgia our entire lives we went away
to school for a few uh five years and
then return to Georgia and we were so
grateful to God to be back in the great
state
and we we had to make decisions in our
life and so over the last 33 years we
have learned that some people are real
excited when we make them and some
people are really not excited at all
and sometimes we think we're doing good
and then sometimes we think I don't know
if that's good or not and this is my
question to you
how do you really know what's good
and how do you really know what's bad
well I'm thankful that we have the word
of God to measure our decisions by and
we certainly can consult the Lord and
and I would say please for all of you in
this room
who are representing me and my family
please be prayerful please seek the
wisdom of God I think God's smarter than
all of us and I think we can lean on him
and the Bible said if we acknowledge Him
God is faithful to direct our path and
to help us make those decisions but as
well as we all know decisions are not
popular with everyone but I heard a
friend he was trying to tell a story and
he said hey can I tell you a story about
a trip I took on a plane he goes man I'd
love to hear that story he said well I
was going to take a trip on a plane and
it was my it's my first time to fly he
said well that's good he said well
he said no it's not he said it was bad
he said because they had promised me to
go up with a pilot in the field and he
was going to take me up but he got sick
and he wasn't able to take me out he
said oh man that's bad he said no I said
it was good he said because the pilot
that was got sick couldn't take me up
and so he decided I'll find the best
pilot on the field to take my place and
that best pilot took me up he said oh
man that's good you he said no actually
it's bad he said because that guy was so
good he wanted to show out in that plane
he flew it straight up nose dived it
back to the Earth flipped it over he
said oh man that's bad he goes oh no he
said it was good he said the most fun I
ever had in my life in a plane he said
was so awesome I had no idea it could be
so exhilarating he said well that's good
he said no actually it's bad he said the
last time we went up and he flipped it
over he said man I fell out of that
plane he said oh dude he said that's
that's bad he goes no actually it's good
he said I had a parachute on him well
that's good he goes no actually it's bad
he said I was free sailing through the
air and man having the best time but he
said I pulled the cord nothing happened
he said oh man that is bad he said no
sir he said actually it was good he said
I've never had so much fun free sailing
through the air and I looked below and
there was a huge Haystack he said that
was so good he said actually no it was
bad he said the closer I got to that
Haystack he said there was a
four-pointed pitch for it sticking right
in the middle of that thing now I was
headed straight forward he said oh man
that's bad he said no sir he said that
was good he said actually he said I
missed that Pitchfork he said oh man
that's good he goes no man that's bad he
said I miss that whole haystack
and to sum up my five minutes and if I
kept five minutes today I want a five
dollar tip
we don't always know what's good and we
don't know what's bad and some of us
have gotten involved in things and
thought it was good and lived long
enough to find out oh that was bad
and some of us have lived long enough to
get involved in some things that weren't
so good and to find out you know what
isn't God good to be able to work out
things in our life that we could have
never worked out on our own
this morning when I came in I was
looking for uh Emery who's been a great
friend and I I'm not familiar with the
capital I'm not even familiar with what
all you do other than we know you have
great responsibility
and I was praying Lord please help Lisa
and I to find our way and we we were
walking through the streets and I
crossed the path of another
representative in the room Mr Chris
Irwin and Chris and I used to be
neighbors and I thought you know what
God knows how to direct our path to the
people we need to meet when we need to
meet them and they'll get us to where we
need to go
and I just say to all of you
we love you and appreciate you
God loves you and wants a relationship
with you
and if you'll trust him God will give
you wisdom to navigate every decision
you have to make and when they're made
if you love God he is able to take
the little things that we do
work them all together for his glory
and our good
and God bless this nation and please God
bless Georgia and God bless you for what
you do thank you for the time let's
Stand Together
I'll pray for you and then we'll have
the pledge
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
that saved our souls
and changed our lives
we give you thanks today Lord for
another beautiful opportunity
to stand
and to glorify your name
Lord may we be humble
and grateful
and express our Thanksgiving
may we show love one to another
and to see the beauty of unity in this
room
well that'd be a gift to this nation
and so I pray for that
Lord we have not because we ask not
and so we ask for Unity in this room
and direction for each individual
and God for these leaders
I pray that you would lift the load of
their burdens and the Lord that you
would be their strength
I thank you for the leadership today
and God please help us and God please
help our nation in Christ we pray amen
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the
Republic for which it stands one nation
under God indivisible with liberty and
justice for all thank you sir

thank you the devotion was great but the
prayer was awesome thank you
it's that time
we've got a lot of work to do today a
lot of work chair recognizes chairman
Tarvin the chair of the committee on
information and audience chairman Tarvin
thank you Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker your committee on information
that audits has read the journal from
the previous legislative today and found
it to be correct
and Mr Speaker something else we could
this is something serious to think about
we uh as I went through these this year
most of these quotes were done before
1900 and this one was before 1883
because
Ralph Waldo Emerson passed away in 1883
but it's amazing how these fit in our
life today
to continue to be yourself in a world
that constantly tries to change you is
the greatest accomplishment
you were just a child when that was
written but that is very profound
and we appreciate that Mr chairman
no doubt about that
chairman Tarvin the chair of the
committee on information and audience

legislative day has been read and found

Mr Clark will you read the caption to
Senate bill
45
Senate Bill 45 by Senator Anna De varte
the 31st to be entitled knack to amend
part three of article 16 in Chapter 2 a
title 20 the physical George annotated
related to health of students in
elementary and secondary education
shall provide for the care of students
being treated for epilepsy or a seizure
disorder this bill ever referred the
committee on education that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
chair lady Dempsey is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
good morning we've had a joy-filled
morning it's very important to pause now
as we've been begin to go through these
measures this first one I actually wore
the right color for today it's purple
this Sunday is being recognized in our
state
as the the day for epilepsy awareness in
the state of Georgia
I was so unaware of a lot of this and I
actually have a husband who had a heat
stroke running track in college which
brought on a seizure and those seizures
returned later in life he's on great
medicine and he stays very healthy
but there are actually 40 different
forms of epilepsy as well as 25
different kinds of seizures some are
easy to recognize some are not just like
many of the things we've done to have a
prevention mode in our schools whether
it is an allergy a reaction to a bee
peanut butter anything else that can
help a child and a parent feel safe it's
time for there to be an epilepsy plan
for each and every child that might be
diagnosed with that and that's what this
is
approximately 16 almost 17 000 children
and teens live actively with epilepsy in
Georgia and Miss 11 or more days of
school in the past year is the average
number that they miss because of this
true challenge
we have an opportunity now with free
training it's not only good for our
teachers and the staff and everyone in
the schools but friends and each of us
who might suddenly find ourselves in
that situation it's free it's online
through the epilepsy Alliance Foundation
it takes about an hour to do with a
brief registration before it and
afterwards a certificate is provided so
what we're going to do is try to join 20
other states that have passed this safe
seizure law
Kentucky Indiana Texas Illinois New
Jersey Virginia Washington Oklahoma
Alabama Colorado Nebraska Minnesota
Pennsylvania Utah Florida Maryland
Arizona Missouri Louisiana and
California we cannot let them take
better care of this situation than we
can it is imperative that we take care
of each and every one of these young
people it requires that no later than
August 1st of this year the Department
of Education shall develop a model
seizure action plan
not every school has a nurse those that
do that can be the person but if they
don't it's quite possible for other
teachers other administrators others to
be aware and be prepared of the exact
need for that exact child some of our
special needs children
have multiple seizures
and very intense seizures but there are
also those that can go unnoticed but can
cause severe complications if not
treated exactly correctly for that
individual child so I ask you to join me
today in supporting this measure to help
our children be safe and parents to feel
safe about having their children in a
school Mr Speaker I will take questions
or yield the well
thank you
lady has no questions thank you ask for
your favorable support
the lady has yielded the well is there

Smith rise

Bill 199 be recommitted to rules

of it is so ordered
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
Senate Bill 65 6-5
by Senator Watson of the first and
others to be entitled an act to amend
chapter 1 and title 33 the official go
to George annotated relating to General
Provisions says to authorize the
Commissioner of Insurance to take
certain actions including but not
limited to promulgating rules applying
for federal monies and establishing an
advisory committee this bill ever for
the committee on insurance that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
chairman Lumsden is recognized to
present the bill
Mr Speaker members of the house I bring
to you Senate Bill 65 which is a
Governor's bill
this bill is a one-page bill that does
only two things first it authorizes the
Commissioner of Insurance to take the
necessary action to establish a
state-based Health Insurance Exchange to
serve as the enrollment platform for
individuals to shop for and purchase
health insurance in Georgia and secondly
it strikes from code language that
prohibits the state from establishing
and operating a state-based health
Exchange
Mr Speaker that's the bill I'll be glad
to appreciate your favorite
consideration gentlemen you ought to see
or is he taking a question uh I'll take
a question
representative owl is recognized for a
question to your right
thank you does the gentleman yield are
you thank you I have two questions if
that's okay first question is as we're
moving to transition away from a
federally facilitated exchange on
healthcare.gov to a state based
Marketplace what is going to be the
timeline for implementation of this
program and how is the state prioritize
funds for uh marketing Outreach and
consumer advocacy as far as the timeline
is concerned the insurance Commissioners
I understand it has been working on this
for some time to get the program ready
to go so it should be a fairly short uh
process to get get the implementation
going and a lot of the funding mechanism
is um
from
the monies that are paid to the
currently that are going to support it
at the federal level will be coming to
the state level
okay one follow-up question if I may
sure thank you if the gentleman further
yields how will the state ensure that it
does have a robust patient navigator
system to reach first of all low income
or uninsured patients and also to help
people who speak languages other than
English I'm just going to say I'm asking
this because I note that healthcare.gov
offers resources for patient
registration in 15 languages and that
George is also becoming increasingly
International so what programs right the
Navigator program will remain it will
just be answerable at the state level
instead of being answerable at the
federal level but The Navigators will
still be just as they are
thank you
gentlemen yield for another question or
two one more question
chair recognizes will park to your left
right in front of you for a question
what part thank you Mr Speaker does the
chairman yield I do is it not true that
that this bill would create a
state-based exchange similar to about uh
10 to 20 other states that have a
state-based exchange I think 17 other
states in DC already have implemented
yet this yes does the general mean uh
yield for one one additional question
yes sir is it not true that this state
basic chain state-based exchange would
have to be subject to the protections
found under federal law that ensure that
for example all the qualified health
benefits are included and the plans that
are on these exchanges and that also
allows for flexibility absolutely we're
still Bound by all of the ACA
regulations so yes this is just uh
transitioning from a federal program to
a state program which frankly if you've
dealt with any federal programs you know
that they can be unwieldy and slow
sometimes and we feel like we can be
more flexible and move quicker when
things need to be dealt with at the
state level than waiting on the feds to
take care of it thank you Mr Speaker
I'll yield the well

relating to state grants authorized
relative to General provisions of solid
waste management so as to specify the
manner in which funds are appropriated
to the South Solid Waste trust fund this
bill I haven't refer to the committee on
natural resources and environment that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
chairman Petrie is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen in the house to bring you
today Senate Bill 95 this bill deals
with the solid waste trust fund on your
desk you'll see a an audit that was done
in 2015 of our uh of our Solid Waste
trust fund one of the primary
recommendations here was that we move
our tire fee so when we established this
in 1992 we established a one dollar fee
on all new tires sold in this state to
help us with Tire pile cleanup all
across the state and many of you are
quite aware as as uh I am of how many of
these piles are still out there all
across our state what we discovered is
we're only collecting about 80 percent
of those funds because not all of our
retailers are paying it and so one of
the primary recommendations that we move
that collection away from retailers
about 46 or so hundred of them in the
state to less than a hundred wholesalers
and which are described in the bill as
Distributors so this Bill very simply
shifts that to Distributors rather than
the retailers all of your tire shops in
your community are going to love you for
this one and uh moreover we're going to
increase our collections dramatically
probably around two to three million
dollars that are being left on the table
that we could use for these for these
cleanup uh
projects uh one more thing in section
one you'll see we do add the governor
will add a new uh appointment to the
recycling Market Development Council and
that will be somebody to represent the
tire industry that's very simple what
this uh very simply what this measure
does Mr Speaker and I'm glad to answer
any questions if there are any
gentlemen yield for a question you have
a couple yes sir I yield
representative Wilkerson is recognized
our question to your left in the back
thank you Mr Speaker uh I guess looking
at Lines 49 through 53
currently
the retailers can deduct a certain
amount is that correct as far as I'm
assuming that's for doing the reports
that's correct does that amount need to
be increased at some point because the
Distributors are now collecting a
significantly amount amount more because
you're having fewer Distributors going
to collect more they're going to submit
more they're going to ask for more than
that three thousand
you know that issue was never addressed
it wasn't as part of the recommendations
in the audit and so we did not address
that so what you'll see representative
that language Remains the Same uh and is
unchanged in this measure
gentlemen yield
representing Chaz Cannon to your right
has a question
Mr speaker thank you do you yield no yes
sir I yield is it not true that rural
counties such as the ones I represent
depend significantly on the distrust
fund for our uh our our
the tires to have a collection to then
get take them back to the state yes sir
it's uh vital we uh these Tire piles are
everywhere and and this material is
useful it's recycled and uh and has
great reuse value so thank you sir thank
you for the question you have one more
representative yes sir Mr Speaker I'll
take one more
right out to your left representative
Bennett
thank you Mr Speaker would the gentleman
yield yes ma'am am I to understand that
the one dollar would no longer be
um
accepted taken or paid to the retailer
is that yeah yeah no ma'am so the so the
one dollar fee will still be uh charged
but it will come from the distributor as
the bill describes it rather than the
retailer so it's just a matter of uh
where we're getting it at what point in
the in the process we're getting it from
the distributor again about a hundred
folks if you can think about the
advantage uh administratively rather
than trying to collect it from 45 4 600
retailers we're collecting it from
around 100 Distributors thank you but
the fee is unchanged the one dollar fee
Remains the Same as it has since 1992.
thank you Mr Speaker and I yield the
well gentlemen's yield of the well is
any objection to the previous question
be in order the chair hears none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to

caption to Senate Bill
129 129.
129 by Senator Williams of the 25th and
others to be titled not to amend chapter
2 of title 21 of the official go to
George Antonio relating to primaries and
elections generally so to provide for
time off
for employees to advance vote this bill
haven't referred the committee on
governmental Affairs that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
a representative Leverett is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen I'm presenting to you today
Senate bill 129. this is a bill filed by
a
form a member of this body Senator Rick
Williams
I was telling Rick whenever I
see members who were house members
who have now gone into the Senate I'm
reminded of the man the words of the old
man in A Christmas Story and one of the
dream sequences where Ralphie imagines
having gone blind because of the life
boy punishment he got and his old man
says what has brought you to this lowly
state
so anyway we've got a number of alums
over there but Rick is doing a good job
this is a bill actually it's it the the
essential and original component of the
bill is section three that was a bill
actually that was filed in this chamber
last year Bob representative Hagin that
would expand the existing Protections in
Georgia law that allow people to take
time off on Election Day to vote the the
statute has not been amended since we
adopted early voting it still just
addresses election day so we are
expanding that protection to also extend
to to our employees can take up to two
hours to vote on a early voting day they
have to notify the employer and the
employer can designate the actual time
they take off but it does allow people
to to have that time off if they need it
to vote on an early voting day so that's
a bill that passed out of this house I
think almost unanimously last year and I
would encourage you to vote favorably
for the bill again this year because
because it contains that plus some other
sections which are and I use this word
in the well but largely cleanup that was
requested by the Secretary of State
specifically just to walk through those
quickly section one that has to do with
the uh performance review boards there's
a provision that allows the appointment
of local election officials to those
boards that has arguably been construed
to refer to an entire Board of Elections
and registration so you'd have to
appoint the entire board we're just
amending that to make it clear that
specific board members can be appointed
in section two we're changing the text
of the disclaimer that has to go out it
has to appear prominently on a ballot
application where the the initial
language I think was in an earlier
version of 202 when it was moving
through the process and there were later
some changes made to that section and
the disclaimer is more consistent with
the laws actually passed section three
is the original bill from the Senate
section four has to do with the reports
that the local election superintendents
have to generate on the day of the
election as to what they're supposed to
file a report currently by 10 o'clock as
to what ballots they've counted and what
balance still remain problem with that
is of course that's the exact time
they're you know assiduously trying to
get the ballots counted so we push that
time back to 11 59 and then the final
section we're just trying to clear up
some of the processes on Audits and make
it clear that auditing can also occur on
primaries and other elections as well as
general elections uh Mr Speaker that's
that's the uh the gist of the bill and
I'm glad to stand for any questions
you have no questions but we do have
another speaker on the bill
thank you ladies and gentlemen I will
yield the well and ask your favorable
consideration of Senate bill 129.
the gentleman has yielded the well
representing Bernal is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
this bill is an improvement however the
intention to modify or eliminate risk
limiting audit procedures could be an
unintended consequence of creating a
lack of Integrity in Georgia's elections
a risk limited audit can tell us to the
highest level of certainty that the
announced election outcome is correct if
there is a problem with the machine
counting a risk limiting audit can catch
and correct the problem if potential
high-stakes sampling of the Statewide
contest is needed a risk limited audit
of the Fail-Safe method is the Fail-Safe
method to collect the accurate sample
size Georgia used the risk limited audit
method to reconcile the 2020
presidential election
this bill would also be more acceptable
if we could add at least 10 drop boxes
to each County because we all don't have
mailboxes at the end of our driveways
and we have constituents that work
different shifts and need more
flexibility thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the will
the lady has yielded the well is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered that Jerry has done the
previous questions ordered is there any
objection to adopting the committee's
substitute the chair has done the
committee's substitute is adopted he is
in objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill the chair he has
done the report of the committee is
agreed to shall this bill now pass all
in favor of the passage of the bill
we'll vote Yes all those opposed will
vote no and the clerk will unlock the
machine
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine on the passage of
the bill the yeas were 161 denays nine
the bill haven't received a requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
true
Mr Clark will you read the caption to
Senate bill 204-204
Senate Bill 204 by representative Donald
the 27th and others to be entitled an
act to amend chapter 14 Title 20 the
official quoted George annotated related
education accountability so to provide
for the recognition of certain
accrediting agencies as evaluators
evaluators of the quality of Education
offered in public schools in this state
this bill ever refer to the committee on
education that committee recommends that
this bill do pass by committee
substitute
the lady from the 36th house District
representative Judy Earhart is
recognized to present the Bill thank you
Mr Speaker members I present to you SB
204 which addresses the issue of
accreditation of our K-12 Public School
Systems the organizations that accredit
our public schools are private agencies
they are funded by our tax dollars by
way of our school districts these
private accrediting agencies are
independent unelected bodies that have
no oversight from the State Board of
Education or the general assembly
they have no accountability to any
elected body or state agency in Georgia
they are in a word unregulated
by their own declaration they are not
subject to open records requests they
have no allowance for due process and
offer no independent appeals process
should a public school system disagree
with the findings of the accreditation
review
additionally in just the past three
years they have entered into the
business practice of selling Improvement
services to the same school districts
they accredit typically based on the
findings of their review
currently in Georgia there is nothing in
code that offers any oversight to these
accrediting agencies so why is this all
code concerning
because eligibility for the Hope
Scholarship requires that our high
school seniors graduate from an
accredited high school so without
accreditation they are not eligible so
essentially we have an unelected
unaccountable private entity with the
power to Grant downgrade or remove
accreditation or threaten to do so and
affect the affect our students
eligibility for hope
hb506 seeks to address these concerns by
providing some guidance and guard rails
to this taxpayer-funded accreditation
process so that Georgia doesn't abdicate
something as important as Hope
Scholarship eligibility to a private
entity the bill creates a new article in
code that does the following it defines
what a recognized accrediting agency is
it sets forth that the State Board of
Education shall establish accreditation
criteria
based 65 percent on the academic quality
of the school district meaning uh
meaning but not including but not
limited to student achievement closure
of student achievement Gap and student
progress 35 of the accreditation
criteria would be based on the financial
efficiency of the school district and
how state and federal funds are being
used by the district to impact student
achievement
it also provides for a due process that
means a hearing a right to appeal a
right for the school district to be
represented by Council if needed
it prohibits the agency from selling any
services or materials to the school
district that are intended to address
any deficiencies they find so thereby
eliminating the conflict of interest
that currently exists it provides for
compliance with open records right the
agency must give full disclosure to the
school system of any complaint that
warrants a special review
it allows the state Boe to determine if
they are complying and most importantly
it provides for an appeals process for
your school districts
through the creation of an accreditation
committee through the Boe in case
there's a dispute between the school and
the crediting agency allows them to find
either through mediation through
compromise to find a solution to any
disagreement that the school district
may have with the accreditation agency's
findings and that is what hb506 does it
passed unanimously out of out of uh our
education committee I asked for your
favorable support Mr Speaker I'll yield
for any questions if there are any
you have a couple to your left chairman
Parsons to your immediate left-handed
question gentleman's recognized for a
question thank you speaker the lady
yield I will
I wanted to ask I see the
Senate Bill 206 is sponsored in the
Senate by the gentleman from the 27th
over there
and I just wanted to ask is this Senate
Bill 207 204 rather the language on this
bill substantially the language and a
bill that I know that you have worked on
it is thank you unfortunately my bill
just didn't quite make it across on
crossover but Senator de la Zell was
certainly
willing to incorporate some of the
language in mind it provided I believe
his originally did not allow for an
appeals process so we added that to his
bill it is essentially the bill that I
carried very good thank you for your
hard work on this thank you
representative Doreen Carter to your
extreme left back here is recognized for
a question thank you Mr Speaker this is
gentle lady yield yes would you clarify
for me the language that states that the
accrediting agency cannot offer services
for a cost but are they also prohibited
from uh providing a service if there's
no additional cost right thank you Frank
with that question does not prohibit
them from providing uh
service if there is no additional cost
it simply eliminates the ability of them
to go in and diagnose the problem and
then sell the school district a solution
to that problem it also doesn't prohibit
them from offering or selling services
that address issues that were not found
as part of a deficiency in the school
district I do remember that was a
concern that you had and I hope that's
been sufficiently addressed that's a
general lady yes you so it does and
thank you for that but I would like
appointed Clarity that it did not leave
the committee uh with full support
because I did vote against it but I will
be voting for it on the floor today
thank you for that thank you
lady year for one more one more question
representative Lisa Campbell to your
left has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes and my Cobb or my Acworth
neighbor
my question is well I'm excited to
affirm your stance advocating for
accountability in our Educational
Systems I'm curious on for Point C1 on
page six an accrediting agency shall not
apply any standards measures or
evaluation criteria and not in
compliance with state law could you just
help me understand the types of criteria
that would be found in that law that
would be anything that that this body
has previously passed or anything that
is currently exists in state laws that
we are making sure that whatever
standards we're using to accredit those
agency don't step outside of what is
currently allowed in state law and would
you allow for yield for one more
question do those um
do those standards evaluations and
criteria currently exist in state law
do the standards exist there are
currently there is nothing in code that
addresses accreditation in the state of
Georgia the only reference to
accreditation now is as it relates to
the Hope Scholarship so there are no and
that's really one of the reasons for the
legislation there currently is no
standard in code that establishes any
parameters for accreditation criteria
and would you yield for one's further
following question last one
if the entire point of this bill
is to review
standards measures and to evaluate our
schools
and the premise is that the
accreditating agency will follow state
law but that law does not exist
how will we rationalize that in
supporting this bill not quite sure I
understand the question however I can
tell you that that is certainly not the
only purpose for the bill
um this is essentially an unregulated uh
area of educational purview uh the
purpose of the bill is both to set
parameters saying look everything that
we're using to comply needs to either be
based on the academic achievement of the
school district or the financial
responsibility of the school district
that's it all the other things as well
it does a lot of other really great
things for our school district by
empowering them to have a say at the
table let's say they don't agree with
their with their review through the due
process and the appeals process and
eliminating the conflict of interest
that I mentioned earlier thank you for
your questions
Mr Speaker if there no further questions
I'll yield The Well the lady has yielded
the well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair here has known the previous
question is ordered is there any
objection to adopting the committee's
substitute the chair has none The
committee's Substitute is adopted he
used any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
that Jerry has done the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machine
have all members voted
for what purpose does representing may
not rise
parliamentary inquiry the state inquiry
is it not true Mr Speaker that over the
summer I was privileged to be on the
accrediting
um special study committee with the
education
committee and it was found that schools
throughout the state of Georgia are
being accredited by an organization that
has no oversight whatsoever and is it
not further true Mr Speaker
that if an accrediting body has no
oversight and they're making up their
own rules to accredit a school that this
bill will help provide more oversight
for the schools so they are not spending
so much money on accrediting Services
because there is no oversight of the
accrediting agency
is that not true
makes sense to me sounds I know the
general lady believes what she sow
States and is certainly informed
all members voted if so the clerk will
lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
161 the Nays 10 that bill having
received your requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed Mr clerk
will you read the caption to Senate Bill
197
197. Senator 197 by Senator Hostetler
the 52nd and others to be entitled not
to amend chapter one and title 43 the
official to George anatelli relating the
general Provisions relative to
professions and businesses so as to
prohibit deceptive or misleading terms
or false representations by Health Care
practitioners in advertisements and
representations this bill ever referred
to the committee on Health Net committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chairman Newton is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'll be brief this
is a transparency Bill and it relates to
having patients better understand the
varied professionals that they interact
with when they receive Health Care it
does this by having the provider be
clear about their area of training both
verbally and in advertising we all know
receiving Health Care can be a complex
and often confusing process especially
at a time when a loved one or family
member is ill or injured there's many
Specialties there's lots of different
areas of expertise Physical Therapy
nutrition and others
we've discussed numerous times that it
does take this team of professionals to
provide this care it turns out more and
more though are also getting Master's
level degrees or sometimes even
doctorates which occasionally can be
confusing with patients if they're not
sure exactly who they're overseeing
doctor is this bill does help by making
sure that everyone's clear about their
their level of training it makes sure
that the patient will be informed of the
field and the level of training that the
provider holds does also as I said
applies to advertising
there's so many varied procedures and
individuals involved I recently had a
family member who was hospitalized with
a with a fracture and even with one of
the family members in the room with
almost all the time it can be a very
confusing situation when multiple people
and Consultants are coming into the
rooms you've got teams of of surgeons
and PAs that work together nurse
practitioners that work together it can
just be a very confusing time even in
the best of situations I think HB 197
I'm sorry SB 197 will help give those
patients and caregivers the accurate
information they need so that they can
heal up and get better I hope you'll
support I'm glad to answer any questions
Mr Speaker
gentleman has no questions
I'd appreciate your support on SB 197

the 27th another is being titled in
actual Man chapter one and title 50 of
the offense go to George annotated
relating the general professions
regarding state government so as we
remove the automatic repealer on the
prohibition on state local governments
from requiring proof of covet
vaccination for government services this
bill having been referred to the
Committee on Public Health that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
for for informational purposes before
chairman Jones presents the bill we do
have a number of folks who have signed
up to speak and we have a Minority
Report chairman Todd Jones is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
good afternoon colleagues welcome back
from lunch
um I have the privilege of carrying
Senate Bill won by Senator dullesal
Senate bill one is a simple bill
it extends in perpetuity the current law
as it relates to the covid-19
vaccination status by removing the
sunset clause on line 40 of the bill
that's all this bill does the current
law prevents government and all of its
subdivisions agencies and authorities
from discriminating against citizens and
denying Services based on coveted
vaccination status Mr Speaker that is
the extent of the bill and I'll yield
for questions
yield for a question yes sir
to your left representative Park Cannon
is recognized for a question thank you
Mr Speaker do you yield
yes representative
it's the kobit 19 pandemic over
representative Park from everything that
I have read and based on the knowledge
that I have received from studying the
data I would indicate to you that I
believe that it is we've also heard that
from certain parts of Washington but at
the end of the day this is not a bill on
whether or not the pandemic is over or
whether or not it's still ongoing but
rather this is a bill that says we are
not going to allow the state its
agencies or its subdivisions or
authorities to discriminate against any
Georgia citizen for services that they
are due
and a follow-up question do you yield uh
yes representative
thank you for that answer and so for
those who are differently abled or maybe
handicapped or more sensitive to
infectious disease how does this bill
impact their livelihood well I can't
speak for all 10.7 million Georgians
other than the fact that I believe in
their freedom and their Liberty I expect
them to take all the proper precautions
just like they did before 2020 and I'm
sure they will continue to do that and
frankly I encourage them to do that
gentlemen yield for one more yes sir
representative Roman straight out in
front of you hi does the gentleman yield
yes thank you um it's kind of a two-part
question does this how does this impact
private entities
this does not impact private entities at
all at all so but with their um with
their contracts be in any way shape or
form
um impacted if they do require a coveted
vaccine for their employees but they do
work for the state
what a private company does in a private
organization does is basically a
contract amongst themselves and we
encourage that okay thank you
gentleman has one more question that
popped up chairman sayings to your left
has a question does the gentleman yield
yes sir is it not true that the CDC
marked this pandemic over while this
protection was in place and Georgia
Citizens had this right that is true as
I reference we have seen Washington and
its Affiliates some of them say that and
in fact you are correct
gentleman has no further questions thank
you Mr Speaker I yielded well and I
asked for your favorable consideration
on sb1
the gentleman has yielded the well
we will now have up to 30 minutes for
those to speak to the bill that are
opposed
representative Al is represented for
a presentation
representative
the clown knows fell off
thank you Mr Speaker
I Rise to speak in opposition to sb1 and
I have to say that speaking against this
bill really feels like deja vu all over
again because I remember when this bill
was heard last year on the Senate side
back when it was called SB 345
so this bill aims to eliminate the
ability for government agencies
including public schools to require
coveted vaccination quote as a condition
of providing any service or access to
any facility
so while it's important to note that no
Georgia public schools at present
require the coveted vaccine for
attendance the harm posed by bills like
this are not abstract
so first while we know much more about
covid-19 at this point in the pandemic
we cannot anticipate future events
variants or public health needs
bills like this tie our hands with
respect to the response we can provide
and it limits our toolbox whether we
think we need the tools at present or
not
so last year when this bill was called
SB 345 Senate Republicans in the HHS
committee my good friends and colleagues
added two amendments both of which we
can see in the text of this bill as it
stands right now
the First Amendment we can see in lines
35-39 this was added by Senator Chuck
huffstetler and this made sure that we
didn't ban hospitals and Health Systems
from requiring coveted vaccination of
their patient-facing employees because
that would be uh
that would run afoul of CMS requirements
for entities that care for Medicare and
Medicaid patients
and I think we can agree this is a good
Amendment
as generally speaking it's good to not
write bills that violate federal law
the second amendment was also a good one
proposed by Senator Dr Dean Burke
which you can see in line 40. this
amendment proposed a one-year sunset
provision on the prohibition of covid
vaccine requirements
Senator Burke of course is no longer
serving in the Senate because he has
been appointed to be the chief medical
officer at the Department of Community
Health
his reasoning for the sunset provision
at the time was that it minimized the
effect of SB 345 because we should not
tie our own hands when it comes to the
ability to respond to Future Public
Health crises
sb1 now eliminates the sunset provision
expanding the potential for this
limitation indefinitely
so beyond the specifics bills like this
seeking to undermine the coveted vaccine
have the effect in fact of undermining
confidence in all vaccines including
those for polio the measles the
chickenpox bacterial meningitis the list
goes on
and whether this was the intended
consequence or not
this rise in vaccine hesitancy supported
in part by state governmental efforts to
undermine trust in public health is in
fact what we have seen here in Georgia
and nationally in the past few years
in other words we've seen how even a
limited version of sb1 passed last year
is already inflicting demonstrable and
Lasting harm
and we've seen
the way that doubt and cynicism
misinformation
and the undermining of confidence in
public institutions has caused cracks in
the foundational elements keeping our
society safe
and indeed free
we have a responsibility
in this body because what we say here
matters I think we would all agree on
that since we serve in this body and
what we legitimize in our discourse what
issues we focus on in this chamber what
we write into law this all matters right
because for good or for bad people
are listening to us
whether explicitly or not bills like
this give oxygen to the idea that people
should be skeptical of the demonstrated
safety and efficacy of a vital public
health tool that here in the state of
Georgia is still vastly underutilized
further this bill limits the Department
of Public Health from having all options
at its disposal to do the often
impossible job we ask of them day after
day
this bill is not about our current
environment or the current state of the
covid pandemic which is ongoing
or what we need to require or prohibit
right now
this bill is about limiting our ability
to respond in the future
to circumstances we may not currently be
able to anticipate
so one point I need to make here is that
pandemics work very quickly we saw that
three years ago
this legislature as we can see Works
quite slowly
this is why we should not write limits
to our pandemic response into law the
same reason that I don't lay out my kids
clothes two weeks in advance because I
cannot possibly anticipate what the
weather is going to look like
so I recognize that one of the easiest
things to do in this chamber is to stand
up here and talk and talk and talk and
talk right I recognize however also that
one of the hardest things to do in this
chamber is to persuade people
but I Ask of my colleagues to please
please please think critically on this
issue and view this not through a
partisan lens
and simply consider that it should not
be the role of this legislature again to
dictate what public health tools can be
at our disposal even if we don't want to
use them right now
don't burn your Bridges
and maybe more importantly than that do
not give people the impression that
Bridges cannot be trusted
more than any one bill
more than just this bill what we say
here
matters
so consider what you say with your vote
today and please vote no on sb1 this
bill that undermines Public Health
thank you I will do well
lady has yielded well
representative Hutchinson is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
we're tired of kobit we're all tired of
covid I'm tired of covid
I really wish covid was not a part of
our everyday lives but unfortunately it
still is
we still have people who wear masks
we're not mandated to wear masks but
some people have compromised immune
systems
or whatever personal reason they decided
they want to wear masks because they
might be afraid of covid
you know
we're not losing 200 people a day like
we were during the height of covet
but Georgia has lost over 40 000 people
to covet and over a million across this
country
I want to digress a minute I'm a social
worker
prior to my election in 2018
um we have a lot of new people prior to
my election I did not hang out at the
Capitol I did not know
the intricacies of what
people or party can pass what or chair
what or when I first got here
I was I am from New Orleans for the new
people my husband's from Georgia
we decided while we were dating that we
could not talk about any form of
football whatsoever not College not
professional nothing so when Atlanta
United that announced that they were
having a professional soccer team
we signed up for season tickets before
there was even a name so I have four
Atlanta United super fans at my house
when I was running somebody asked what's
the first thing you're going to do on
your first day of office and I said
probably not much but I will start
Atlanta United day
I was elected in November 2018.
they won the MLS Cup in December of
2018. so when I was sworn in in January
that Atlanta United day was already
started so I joined reached across the
aisle joined the effort
and the person I was working with in the
house said I don't like license plates
so when the Atlanta United license plate
Bill comes I want you to carry it
I didn't know any better that was
probably my first week as a freshman
here but I was very excited
until the lobbyists called me out the
day before the boat to say he made the
executive decision that a freshman from
the minority party could not pass a
license plate bill
that was my first lesson here about what
I could and could not do so I've been
watching
and things that I thought before I came
here
just didn't turn out to be
such as
medical autonomy
I kind of thought that was a one-sided
thing
I kind of thought that we only talked
about medical autonomy when we were
talking about Reproductive Rights but
then I learned by watching the debates
about masks and vaccines that these are
very personal medical decisions that
people make
with their Doctors Without The
interference of government
parental rights
but most importance
when we're talking about vaccines when
we're talking about making decisions for
children
but there were also times like trans
bills where parents have no rights
I thought local control was a huge thing
until redistricting
and local bills were hijacked
and that's why I am confused about this
bill
somebody I'm sure
I'm truly confused when does local
control matter
because I represent Snellville if the
next bird flu or raccoon flu or
coyote flu hits Snellville
if this passes it will limit what we can
do to protect my constituents from
raccoon flu
and believe me I have a lot of raccoons
in my yard so I am concerned about
raccoon blue but if this bill passes
will Snellville have
the authority
to control what happens in Snellville so
that we don't spread raccoon flu
reading this bill I don't think so
when covid first when first broke out
and even after and even now we were
criticized as a country that we did not
have a safety plan we didn't have a
backup plan if something like covet hit
the planet which it did
I feel like sb1 is sending us back into
the unknown
if we don't have the ability at the
municipality where these things are
coming out
how will we control for the next
outbreak
and that is my concern
so I'm asking you for the sake of
raccoon flu or coyote flu or whatever
flu comes up next year
let's vote no on sb1 and keep local
control where it belongs thank you Mr
Speaker you're the well
lady has yielded the well
represent your nullowitz
is recognized to speak to the bill
represent vanilla Woods thank you thank
you Mr Speaker I actually prefer the
term trash Panda but that's not what my
speech is about I actually rise before
you today to share my concerns with sb1
we know and we have the data that proves
to us that the vaccine rate for routine
childhood immunizations has decreased in
Georgia measles bacterial meningitis
polio the rates for all of these
childhood vaccines has declined in
Georgia these are completely preventable
diseases and they have devastating
consequences for the children and adults
who contract these diseases or even if
they are simply exposed to these
diseases for example if an unvaccinated
child exposes their teacher to measles
and if their teacher is expecting a
child
the consequences for that unborn child
are potentially lethal
in Cobb County where I'm from
covid wasn't actually the first time
students had to miss school because of
an outbreak
in the fall of 2019 in fact there was a
measles outbreak in a middle school in
Cobb County that kept almost two dozen
students out of school
for several weeks alarmingly and this is
this is what really disturbs me this
outbreak this measles outbreak was never
even reported to Public Health officials
they happened to learn it when they were
when they were trying to trace what
could have happened with an outbreak
that began in Florida and they realized
it was in Georgia and then they realized
that kids had had the measles and nobody
had told the Department of Public Health
that is deeply concerning
the root of this outbreak was parents
who I think
sincerely believed they were acting in
the best interest of their children by
not vaccinating them
but these parents were in all likelihood
making these decisions based on a stream
of misinformation that is perpetually
churned from a fire hose held by those
who the reality is stand to make a whole
lot of money out of this industry of
vaccine disinformation
I have spent years now
in my role as a House member immersed in
the world of anti-vaccine misinformation
and I'm telling you there is a lot of
money that a lot of folks are making so
they they it is to their economic
benefit that they have policies like
this like sb1 that we're discussing
today because it continues to erode that
faith in vaccines I am an advocate for
vaccines because I am so aware of how
critical these vaccines are to the
health of all Georgians and by extension
to our economy
if we learned anything from the pandemic
and we learned a lot I hope it's that a
healthy Workforce is critical to every
business in Georgia thus I am baffled
that any employer wouldn't encourage
their employees to be vaccinated against
any illness as well as their families
because we also know when your kids are
sick your employee isn't able to come to
work
it's troubling then to hear elected
officials who purport to want a strong
vibrant healthy Georgia for our
individual Georgians and for our economy
to be talking about policies that do
undermine that faith in vaccines we know
that discussions like those behind sb1
do erode public faith and vaccines there
is data on this also a lot of scientists
have been studying this we've had a
pretty large sample size for the past
few years
we know that the potential consequences
of this anti-vaccine anti-science
rhetoric is incalculable
yet we continue with these discussions
because all of us in this room hear from
a handful of activists who continue to
perpetuate this pervasive culture of
misinformation I know that the cohort of
folks that emails me about any
legislation having to do with vaccines
anything the past few years having to do
with the pandemic the same parents who
wanted parental Authority you all know
that term the same parents who wanted
parental authority to you know choose
whether they can have their children
vaccinated to choose whether their
children have a you know Mass the ones
who send me information from these
organizations that are making a lot of
money spreading vaccine misinformation
it's the same folks who emailed me when
they loved this bill I always know when
I need to be on the lookout for a
vaccine bill because I start to get
emails from the same group of folks and
I'm sure y'all also have similar cohorts
of parents again I do believe they love
their children intensely and they think
they're doing the right thing I also
know that they have been misled
equally concerning is the rise of
similar sentiments that aren't just
anti-science they're not just
anti-vaccine but they're anti-scientist
they're anti-scientist Georgia is home
to the CDC it makes me heart sick and
continues to have made me heartsick over
the years to see people who I know and
otherwise respect saying the most awful
things about the CDC because you know
what it really is and I've told this to
my friends and family who live out of
state who would say things about the CDC
or maybe say some conspiracy I'm like do
you understand that in Atlanta these
aren't just a bunch of really smart
scientists they're our neighbors they're
members of our community they're the
people that our kids play soccer with
they're the people who are behind line
at the at the Publix or the people who
were going to cheer for the Atlanta
United with or maybe the Saints who
knows your mileage may vary
wanted to make sure y'all are listening
who dat
these CDC scientists are not only the
experts in our fields in their fields
not my field their field
I'm really good at talking
these CDC scientists are not only the
experts in their fields but they are our
neighbors right we know them we know
they're not part of some kind of
conspiracy we know they're not part of
any nefarious plot they're just trying
to do the work that they have been
trained to do
frankly I think that these scientists at
the CDC are patriots again it bothers me
greatly to know that we are having
policy discussions that one way or
another undermine the work of these
Americans who are working to keep us
safe and alive and healthy and they're
doing it right here in our backyard
I'm grateful for their work I'm grateful
for the work of all of the public health
employees who continue to plod ahead
through the morass of disinformation and
public policy proposals that serve only
to undermine their life's work
I urge you to vote against this bill I
urge you to support our Public Health
officials I urge you to support vaccines
in Georgia I yield the well
representative drenner is recognized to
speak to the bill
I got 12 minutes worth of information
I got nine pages here to talk about
just so you all know I spent the last
three years
dreaming about the day that I would get
to come down here and talk about covet
again
right every one of us in this chamber
has been impacted by covid
first
where you live during a pandemic matters
second how old you are during a pandemic
matters third what you do for a living
during a pandemic matters
and fourth who is running your response
matters
so demographics geography social status
party affiliation and federal state
relationships matter during a pandemic
the federal response to covid was to
avoid a national strategy on what was a
national problem
that put Americans reaction apart from
the rest of the world
there was a different response in every
state
and no other country was the level of
friction between National and
sub-national governments as high as it
was in the United States
everybody's sleeping now in the back
remember I have 11 more minutes to go
thank you Karen
these decisions shaped two basic
patterns first the decisions that each
state were not just reactions to the
virus but were embedded in a far longer
and much wider policy stream
second these decisions are clustered in
important ways with groups of States
following different tactics
there were many arguments for allowing
the states to take the lead to begin
with the virus did not flare up
uniformly
as the disease developed they had
surprising patterns hitting both urban
areas and Rural hot spots you may recall
that it hit food processing plants here
in Georgia
so crafting a single strategy proved
extraordinarily difficult
most notably in the early weeks of the
crisis the lockdown decision was the
central
public policy action
the pivotal question was whether the
lockdown decisions followed the
seriousness of the outbreak
sadly the death rate provided the best
evidence of the severity of the disease
and it was the most uniform National
measure even though reporting problems
made even this measure hard to collect
the timing of the governor's decisions
was not directly connected with the
seriousness
of their problems
the pattern of State responses showed
that the lockdown in March
voted for President Trump at a much
lower rate and tended to have a weaker
Republican control of their state
governments
the decision to lock down was also
consisted with a broad collection of
disparate policy decisions over a long
time for example consider the connection
between a Governor's lockdown decisions
in a state previous decision to expand
Medicaid as a part of the Affordable
Care Act
in the states that did not lock down in
March almost two-thirds had to decided
not to expand Medicaid
there were also Stark differences in the
state's investment in their public
health programs
the outbreak of coved has laid beer a
trio of fundamentally essential issues
the first is the relationship between
the federal government and the states
the relation among the states and what
is at the point here today is the
relationship between the states and
their localities
in Georgia
the frictions between the state and the
local governments boiled over with
Fierce battles over who had the
authority to set the rules for Citizens
which businesses could stay open and
under what circumstances
this intergovernmental confusion meant
that it was impossible to get an
accurate picture of the disease it
spread and its Health implications
in fact The Benchmark data for tracking
coved increasingly came not from
government sources but instead from
private and non-profit organizations
including a collaborative of media
organizations that created their own
covid tracking project
now I know at this point all of you are
like why is she continuing to go on
right
I heard you penny
I'm going on because the most enduring
questions that has emerged from this
covet outbreak is whether governments in
the United States failed
or at least did not succeed As Americans
needed it to precisely because it relied
so heavily on the states as Laboratories
which produce such wide-ranging
experiments
the questions you should be asking is
did some states develop strategies that
given the problems they face produce
significantly better outcomes
did frictions in the system between
Washington and some states between many
states and between some states capitals
and their local governments create much
higher risk and cost more lives
these questions require us to sustain
and examine because it's impossible to
escape the conclusion that the country's
initial response was successfully
less so than other countries
its response in turn weakened The
public's trust and widened political
polarization at precisely the time
that citizens and Business Leaders
struggled to determine who to believe
that's really what's at issue today in
sb1 is who do we believe
we are preempting local governments
again today was DeKalb day
DeKalb was one of the first counties in
the state
to shut down
to issue a mask mandate
which was taken
at issue by the state
preempting local governments
from reacting to a pandemic
is the least efficient way to control a
pandemic
I would encourage you I know everybody
wants to go I probably have what five
more minutes left
I'm thinking about maybe singing a song
in all seriousness
the pandemic was probably the most
serious
crisis our country faced
and continues to face in eliminating
local control is not the way to move
forward I ask you to vote no for sb1
thank you Mr Speaker I'm gonna go sit
down now
the lady has wisely yielded the wealth
is there an objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair has
done the previous question is ordered we
do have a Minority Report
for up to 20 minutes
representing Ann Allen Westbrook is
recognized for
the first part of The Minority Report
representative you will not control the
time on the Minority Report
thank you Mr Speaker and good afternoon
colleagues I Rise to speak against sb1
because it taints what should be a
straightforward Public Health measure
with partisan politics and it needlessly
puts Georgians at risk for preventable
illness
we know that covid-19 has been
unfortunately politicized in a way that
other diseases have not been and that
was a conscious Choice made by political
leaders People Like Us
people in this body national leaders
Amplified by I would argue some of the
less reputable media outlets in our
country also played a part in that and
the choice that they made was to
prioritize political posturing and a
distorted view of individual liberty
over the health of Americans and what
was the result of that
we lost so many lives unnecessarily
because of that choice
but going forward we can choose better
we can make a different choice we do not
have to continue to make Public Health a
partisan political issue
it is a fact that the covet vaccine
saved lives and continues to save lives
all of us prior to 2020 had not
experienced life in a global pandemic
none of us had and what we have seen
since then is more than a million
Americans have died
including about 42 000 Georgians
but fortunately we have a vaccine for
covet 19. it was created evaluated and
authorized for use in about a year
researchers were able to leverage
previous coronavirus and vaccine
research to develop a vaccine for this
disease and record time and what does
That vaccine do it does what vaccines do
it reduces transmission and reduces the
severity of illness to save lives
our message about this should be that
this is a feat of Science and Innovation
this is a good thing we should be
shouting this from the rooftops and
that's what we should have been doing
for three years but we're not we're
playing political games
should not be our message this only
works if people get the vaccine and we
have a role to play as leaders in making
sure that people do that
sb1 does not send that message it uses
our powerful platform as Leaders to give
oxygen to misinformation and it sets
people up to contract and transmit a
preventable disease
meanwhile our Georgia Department of
Public Health is communicating accurate
information about coveted vaccines and
accurate information about other
vaccines if you go to their website you
will see information about requirements
for some vaccines in some circumstances
and recommendations for vaccines and
other circumstances it is consistent in
its messaging of confidence and trust
that these are life-saving measures that
we should be encouraging Georgians to
take part in
and we are going to contradict that for
politics
that is bad policy and bad governance
unfortunately as some of my colleagues
have noted the harm done by this bill is
not limited to covet 19. misinformation
much like viruses has a tendency to
spread and there's a very unfortunate
spillover effect with covid-19 vaccine
misinformation it leads to mistrust of
other types of vaccination including
vaccinations we have been relying on for
decades vaccines to address measles and
other childhood illnesses measles was
considered eradicated in the year 2000
and we're now seeing outbreaks of this
preventable illness in American children
because of misinformation
last year in Ohio 77 children under the
age of five got sick with measles
one-third of those were hospitalized
speaking to the parents here do you
remember what it was like when you had a
child under five and that child got sick
especially maybe if you were a new
parent and it was your first child it's
terrifying
and we are allowing a situation where
misinformation is leading to children
being hospitalized when they don't need
to be
this is not something we used to see in
the U.S we didn't see this level of
vaccine hesitancy that we see now at the
same time of that Ohio outbreak there
was a study from the Kaiser Family
Foundation that reflected a significant
rise in parents who oppose vaccine
requirements in schools that's grown
significantly since 2019 that's a direct
result of the pandemic how we mishandled
it and the way we let misinformation
grow
you can draw a direct line from bills
like sb1 to vaccine hesitancy to lower
vaccination rates to outbreaks of
preventable illness in children there is
a relationship between and among those
things
so in closing I just want to remind us
all of the position of influence and
power that we have just from the fact
that we sit in these seats the choices
we make as Leaders matter
are we going to be a voice for accurate
evidence-based information are we going
to join the loud chorus of folks who
like to sow distrust and spread
misinformation We cannot put good
information and bad information on an
equal plane and that's what sb1 does we
can't do it when the stakes are this
High the stakes are our neighbor's
health
so I ask you please vote no on sb1 and I
yield the well
thank you Mr Speaker the lady has
yielded well representative Lisa
Campbell is recognized to speak
to the bill as part of The Minority
Report representative Campbell
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues today I Rise Against Senate
bill one
and I encourage everyone in this chamber
to take just a few minutes and I promise
a few minutes
to think about the long-term positive
impact we could have on our children's
health by voting no
this bill allows the prohibition against
requiring proof of covet vaccination to
stand
not just this year
but permanently
and as we Mark the second anniversary of
the U.S covid-19 vaccination campaign
understanding the impact of vaccines on
reducing disease burden is needed to
inform our future
evidence-based action on this bill today
it has been almost two and a half years
since the first coveted vaccine was
given in the U.S and since then listen
to this y'all we have administered more
than
655 million doses
eighty percent of the population has
received at least one dose
with a cumulative effect of preventing
more than 18 million additional
hospitalizations
18 million hospitalizations were
prevented
and More Than 3 million additional
deaths
in early 2021 when the coveted vaccines
were widely distributed there was a huge
demand we remember it right at the peak
of the vaccination campaign 4 million
people got vaccinated in one day
that demand dropped off by the summer
and two years later many states are
still barely north of 50 percent of
people fully vaccinated including in
Georgia
so how many lives would have been saved
if that slump in vaccine demand had
never happened have you ever wondered
about this
to answer that question Brown University
and Microsoft researchers calculated the
peak vaccination rate for each state and
then imagined that that rate continued
until all adults in the state were fully
vaccinated
the total for the country is Stark
yes many of the nearly one million
coveted deaths took place in 2020 before
vaccines
but from December 2020 through November
2022 these researchers estimate that the
covid vaccination program
could have prevented more than 18.5
million additional hospitalizations and
3.2 million additional deaths
without vaccination there would have
been nearly 120 million more covid-19
infections
the vaccination program also saved the
U.S
1.15 trillion dollars in medical costs
and these numbers are even more striking
in certain states where more than half
of the deaths could have been avoided
half of the deaths could have been
avoided
in Georgia at least 13 000 deaths
could have been averted by vaccination
according to that research
so in addition to tying our hands to
prevent ongoing illness it is worth
noting the trends of declining coveted
vaccination rates as others have shared
are increasingly spilling over into
other routine immunizations
did you all know that Georgia is the
fourth least vaccinated state in the
nation
number one for business but number 48th
for vaccination rates and that's for all
vaccinations not just coven
and Studies have found that Georgia
ranks in the bottom for vaccine rates
for our children for flu 47th for adults
for flu and 42nd for the number of
adults even vaccinated for tetanus
these Trends began before the pandemic
and are historically low rates are
worsening according to the new data from
CDC that shows the percentage of U.S
children entering kindergarten their
required immunizations fell to 93
percent in 2022
percentage points below the recommended
herd immunity levels of 95 and lower
even still than vaccination rates in
2021.
and while one or two percentage points
might not seem concerning
one percent represents tens of thousands
of people children who may be
inadequately protected from diseases we
can easily prevent through immunization
these Trends are alarming both for our
health and our finances
the CDC estimated that vaccinating
children born from 1994 to 2018
would prevent
472 million illnesses that's why we're
talking about this it would prevent
nearly 30 million hospitalizations and
more than a million deaths
the state-run vaccination requirements
are also projected to save
479 billion dollars in health care costs
and other related costs
are unvaccinated are a great risk
because the disease vaccines prevent
have few effective treatments
even in this day of great medical
advances children who are unvaccinated
are not protected against the suffering
the complications and the long-term
disability that can come from vaccine
preventable diseases
and one last thought
everyone in this chamber
who cheers go dogs after every single
prayer
just know that we personally
benefited from required proof of
vaccinations
for measles mumps rubella chickenpox
tetanus Hepatitis B TB
why in the world are we going to be
denying these same protections for
students
all of this comes down to trust
whether our political leadership creates
the climate of trust in the public
health agency's efforts in the science
in the ability of our health care sister
system to deliver
this is not about discrimination
it is in fact about the health of all
Georgians and for all of these reasons I
ask you to please seriously consider
voting no on this bill
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
that completes the Minority Report
now we'll have for up to 20 minutes for
chairs time
cheerleaded Cooper is recognized
for the chairs time
thank you Mr Speaker but I would like to
yield my time to Chairman Todd Jones
chairman Jones is recognized to speak to
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I appreciate it and
I appreciate my colleagues providing
that information but I'd like to be able
to provide the chamber with I'll just
say maybe something else to think about
I think first and foremost let's think
about what the last year has brought up
on for us I think we have had I'll say
an upward right trajectory within our
state and that has been with this law in
place by taking out the sunset we don't
do anything to take the trajectory off
fine I think the second thing we heard a
lot about undermining public trust
undermining Public Health I think that's
just a fallacy let me think about this
for just one moment in the latter parts
of 2020 president-elect Joe Biden said
who is going to take the shot are you
going to be the first person to take it
Vice president-elect Kamala Harris when
referring to the development of the
vaccine said it's untrustworthy
we did not hear
either party talking about undermining
the public health but I could keep going
Dr fauci said all three vaccines are 100
effective against death and
hospitalization I think if given the
opportunity he would sit in this well
and say I was wrong
this bill is not about whether or not we
can have an argument over is it or isn't
it in terms of the pandemic and the
treatment of sedge what we're saying is
we're not going to permit discrimination
we do not want discrimination when it
comes to the state its subdivisions as
agencies its authorities to be able to
provide services necessary services to
our citizens
another speaker talked about the ability
to wear masks I say please do so it is
your absolutely your individual right to
wear a mask and take the vaccine if
you'd like get a booster every four
weeks I encourage that
in terms of the speaker that spoke to
the idea that this was going to
undermine the state's ability to attack
other pandemics and let's hope in all of
our lifetimes there's not another
pandemic but if there is this bill only
speaks to the covid vaccine it does not
speak to any other animal vaccine or any
other animal flu
in terms of what we can do as a state
good or bad we have data that tells us
over the last two and a half years we
have had educational loss that is
generational generational for our
children
we know what we have done it needs to be
fixed and that Gap needs to be closed
and we will do that
let's talk a little bit about mistrust
it was commented by a speaker regarding
the mistrust of certain news agencies
let's talk about what happened to the
Public Square in the new Public Square
being that one made up online
of Twitter and Google and Facebook and
meta and Instagram
let's talk about who was told you're
de-platformed let's talk about who was
told your content is wrong this is
supposed to be the Public Square there's
supposed to be a free exchange of
information and ideas and brainstorming
but yet what happened you were basically
shut down if you did not follow what as
we turned out to know certain federal
agencies did not want you to say on
those particular platforms
another comment was made about children
we all get very I'll say Melancholy we
all get very serious when it comes to
our children and we should
again this isn't a bill about the
efficacy or not efficacy of the vaccine
or whether or not we should do this or
that but let's get the facts straight
children underneath the age of 17.
statistically
they literally were 25 to 50 percent
less fatality rate for covid than for
the annual flu
we don't shut down schools we don't shut
down economies we don't shut down States
and we definitely don't discriminate
against our citizens because of the
annual flu why would we suddenly want to
do it now
the last two points I'd like to make
hopefully
will give a little bit of I guess a
clear Earth story of my feelings
there is no intent to undermine any
other vaccines to my colleague in the
minority party I absolutely agree with
her and I truly believe that MMR polio
etc those are absolutely critical and I
hope that we still see that I don't have
grandkids yet but when they do I expect
to be able to push those through
but making the assumption
that this bill not just undermines the
vaccine but what the minority party did
not contemplate inside of any other
comments
was natural immunity
we never heard the phrase of natural
immunity and what that would do in terms
of helping our citizens be able to fight
this virus and I think it is something
that is definitely not considered
further we know from listening to
scientists that The lethality of this
virus just like others
started high and came down low
we also know more about the
comorbidities and we can keep going in
terms of the effect that they had
But ultimately that's not what this bill
is about
this bill is simple
this bill does not allow the state its
subdivisions its agencies its
authorities to discriminate
we don't want people to be discriminated
against to not get a fishing license to
not get a hunting license and not get
their driver's license but I will give
you one that I would say is more
important than all of that
we don't want a subdivision of this
state to even consider
saying for you to vote there's a
requirement like this
and let's think about that for a moment
Mr Speaker that ends my comments and I
ask for the favorable consideration from
the body for sb1
the gentleman a geodewell
is there any objection to a Greenville
report of the committee which was
favorable to the past of the bill Jerry
has another report of the committee is
agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the pastor the bill will vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
for what purposes represents
representative inelowitz rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry is
it not true that the reason we are all
encouraged to get a new flu shot every
year is because not only does our
natural immunity Wane over time there
are also new strains of the flu each
year that we want to be prepared for
with that continued routine vaccination
again to address the new strains of the
flu that may emerge in the fact that
natural immunity Cannon does wane
I'm sure the lady believes what she so
States
for what purpose is representing Jason
Ridley rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker is it not true that this week
alone that in uh coveted georgia.com
says that there's 300 Only 377 coveted
hospitalizations in the whole state of
10 and a half million and also is it not
for the truth it says regardless of the
reason for admission meaning that
they're not there for covet alone
and also the CDC says that there's the
1347 flu hospitalizations this week four
times of what covet is so I'm pretty
sure the pandemic is over
if the gentleman sow States
for what purpose does representative
bird rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry is
it not true the most local government is
the individual and further is it not
true this is about personal
responsibility and medical freedom
I'm sure the lady believes what she so
States
for what purpose
does representing Roman rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker is it not true that
up to 52 000 people die from the flu per
year however we had over a million
people die from covid so far in the
United States
I'm sure the lady has correct figures
and believes in what she states one more
if I may
stature statue inquiry is it not true
that unlike the flu we've only had a few
years to study coven and we're trying to
do our best to mitigate the negative
impacts because we're now finding people
like myself are developing long coveted
symptoms as a result of infection
you know how she feels that's for sure
for what purpose is representing sharper
rise
parliamentary inquiry stage inquiry is
it not true that regardless if you vote
yes or no on this bill that the CDC and
other agencies that track how many
people have covert they are not aware
that a lot of these people that are
getting coveted that are taking home
tests are not reported but you have
several people that are still getting
coveted every single day that are doing
home testing that we will never know
about
thank you
yet the gentleman's those States for
what purposes representing Maine arise
parliamentary inquiries Mr Speaker State
inquiry is it not true that I firmly
disagree in the government forcing
people to do things and I would be
voting yes for this bill but I want to
support my party and I'm going to vote
no for it
I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks
taking one more representative Barnes
for what purpose do you rise
parliamentary inquiry police
you can make written comments if you'd
like
for what purpose does
heavy State your inquiry thank you Mr
Speaker is it not true that if we don't
continue to take precautions that we may
experience in other pandemic so we have
to continue to take precautions is it
not true thank you Mr Speaker
if the lady is so States
I'm going to take one more
I've heard from this lady but we'll hear
from again for what purpose does
representing all rise
you parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry is it not true that the sponsor
of this bill discussed educational loss
as an incentive for this bill however
did not discuss how School absenteeism
might be affected by eroding or
disallowing vaccine standards
I'm sure the lady believes what she
speaks

minority leader Beverly has a question
thank you speak to this gentleman Yale
yes sir what happens if the Senate

so that is that is a good question that
I don't have an answer to my assumption
would be that there would be a vacancy
which would then when we're out of

the question of confirming that
appointment next session that's my best
guess
I believe the gentleman answered

chairman Tyler Paul Smith is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
ladies and gentlemen this August body I
bring to you today Senate bill 73.
Senate Bill 73 is in response to an
issue we've had here in Georgia law and
basically what we've had is there have
been folks that have tried to get around
our Georgia no call Provisions whenever
somebody were to sign up to not be
contacted Again by telemarketers and
such they've done this by going over to
foreign companies and so basically the
situation presents itself as you know
we're prohibited by Georgia law from
calling these folks but if you're in a
foreign country you can do this so uh
what this would do is allow citizens on
that do not call list to receive more
than one unauthorized telephone
solicitation within any 12-month period
they can bring action against the person
or entity that made those solicitations
and or the person or entity that the
telephone solicitations were made on
behalf of for injunctive Relief and
damages Mr Speaker that's the bill and
I'll yield for two questions

secondary metal recyclers
in section one of SB 60 States it shall

program for the next two years that
would allow these the certified
recyclers to be able to pay a hundred
dollars cash to to uh people that are
bringing in recycling but not limited to
catalytic converters use utility wire
communication copper copper wire or

non-profit just right up the straight

about 30 seconds for for these Bad
actors to go get under a bus cut the
catalytic converter off throw it in a
car and leave on my way up I have a
friend right behind me the clerk just

there's representative McCullum rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
I should ask this question before I
apologize so if I have a little shop in
my backyard and I have a Cadillac
converter back there does that mean that
I'm breaking the law on this bill
state that question again
if I have a little Garage in my backyard
fixing cars and I have Cadillac
converters there does that mean I'm
breaking the law
I'd be careful but I'm sure
the gentlemen
so States
probably depends on the law enforcement
in your area is probably what it does
amount to for what purposes
representative Hutchinson rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
isn't that true Mr Speaker
that I was trying to ask the the
presenter is this not illegal now are we
is it not illegal to steal a Cadillac
head border today
I'm not sure if the technical answer
that question but uh evidently it's not
or they wouldn't have brought this bill
but it's a good question the lady has
she may want to come speak to the author
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
162 the Nays four the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
not yet
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
Senate bill 164.
Senate Bill 164 by Senator huffstetler
the 52nd to be entitled an act to amend
chapter 26 at title 43 the official go
to Georgia relaying the nurse's sister
provide for licensure or advanced
practice registered nurses this bill
ever for the committee on health that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
by committee substitute
chairman Newton is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues uh
Senate Bill 164 is very similar to a
bill we passed earlier in the session
House Bill 215 that dealt with a license
uh for advanced practice registered
nurses once again all nurses all RNs do
have a license now and then they get
authorization to practice within an
advanced area whether it's certified
nurse Midwife of nurse practitioner
CRNA or a clinical nurse specialist
Senate Bill 164 will allow the nursing
board to also give them a particular
license for recognizing this additional
training that they've gotten rather than
just an authorization it'll it will it's
something that's that's very desired by
those that put in that hard work that's
required to get that advanced practice
Registered Nursing degree there's no
change in scope of practice this also
has a second section on it that
recognizes anesthesiology assistance
those are physician assistants Pas but
they're specifically and exclusively in
an area of of anesthesiology or
anesthesia anesthesiologist assistant
and so there's a section in the bill
that clarifies that their licensure
comes just like really identical to all
the other physician assistants but those
are more like generalists and
anesthesiologist assistant is like a a
particular specialty of a physician
assistant I think the two things are
great recognition of what we've talked
about earlier about the teamwork
required in in this I think they're
deserving of having their own license or
their own section in the code like
anesthesiologist assistant I hope that's
something that we can we can move
forward on and once again pass
unanimously
glad to answer any questions Mr Speaker
you have no questions thank you and I
appreciate your support on SB 164.
gentlemen as yield of the well is there
any objection to the previous question
be in order the chair here's none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to adopting the committee
to this objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair has done
the committee substitute is adopted is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair has done the report of the
community is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machine
have all members voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
166 the Nay zero the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
Senate Bill 74 7-4
Senate Bill 74 by Senator artillery the
19th being titled not to amend titles 10
15 and 51 of the official to George
annotated relating the Commerce and
trade courts torts respectively so it's
required the disclosure of the nature
and practices of businesses that provide
legal services this bill ever heard of
the committee on Judiciary that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
well burchett is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I hope everybody in
this house stays in the same posture as
they were in that last vote
um Senate bill 74. if you
um you ever driving down the highway or
or listening on TV and you see a an
attorney
or lawyer commercial and they're they're
telling you uh that they're going to
deliver a hundred percent of the time
and they're going to deliver x amount of
dollars uh this this and you don't like
hearing that or seeing that it's Bill
you're going to like what this bill does
it it
um it allows for attorneys or lawyers to
advertise but it doesn't allow for them
to essentially misrepresent what they
can and can't do it's okay to say that
you know we have we've had good outcomes
but it's not okay to say
um we're a hundred percent
um you know winners here or basically
um over represent what they can do
that's the first part of the bill it
basically regulates the
um the attorneys and lawyers from uh
going Beyond just puffing and telling
you that they're a good Law Firm but uh
going going to a point where they're
saying I'm 100 going to be able to
deliver for you and I'm going to get you
uh x amount of dollars so that's one
portion of the bill in uh Judiciary we
made an amendment and and the amendment
we made was the Apex doctrine that this
house has already passed and what the
Apex Doctrine is just as a review is a
doctrine that allows for protections
against
um unreasonable deposition so if you do
not have unique knowledge of something
and you're a high-ranking official
um uh let's just say of a large
corporation and there's no need for you
to be deposed or asked to be answered
questions because of the knowledge you
can get from a lower ranking
official or employee then there will be
a protection for that a protective order
against having to be deposed and so this
is a tort reform measure that we passed
earlier on in this session we've added
it on to make sure that it doesn't
you know doesn't get vetoed on the other
side to a good piece of legislation that
also regulates attorneys when it comes
to advertising Mr Speaker that's the the
basis of the bill and I'll yield for
questions
through your lift if you yield represent
representative manilowitz has a question

cannot uh get a stunt double in other
words a very good looking man or a good
looking woman to go in your commercial

to get customers you have to be a lawyer
to do that
yield
the gentleman yields got a couple more
if you don't mind representative Okoye
and then back to your left
thank you Mr Speaker that's generally
healed are you is it not true that since
this chamber is crawling with lawyers
that this bill is in danger of being of
not passing because they don't run
against it I hope that's not the case
leader illustration

famous speakers Jim O'Neill Jim O'Neills

considerable amount of time this year
working on this apic Apex legislation

have and isn't it true that the house
previously passed an apex bill out that
went over to the Senate that is true and
that Apex Bill did not even receive a
vote on the floor of the Senate over
there correct has not so uh this very
important issue that you're describing
it has only come out of the house if
passed here twice this year the Senate
hasn't passed this legislation that is a
fact that human knows what he speaks and
I will say this about the Apex Doctrine
this this is the number one priority of
the business community in the state of
Georgia is the Apex Doctrine and Mr

so as to establish a Georgia Farmland

refer to the committee on ways and means

the agriculture chairman of this house
chairman Robert Dickey is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I
present SB 222
um Georgia Farmland conservation act and
trust fund that comes over from my
colleague in the uh
220. excuse me thank you minority leader
um what this bill is about is
establishing a purchase agricultural
conservation easement program 29 other
states in our country presently have
this so it's nothing new it's a
state-led incentive initiative to
partner with farmers who wish to protect
our precious Farmland from development
uh so by working with Farmers
um voluntarily
will restrict our development rights uh
and and set up this program this program
uh does not have any funding with it
this is just a mechanism to establish it
this year
um it coordinates with federal dollars
and local matching funds to extend these
uh conservation easements uh USDA
presently allocates 450 million dollars
nationally uh for this Farmland
protection and Georgia president is not
of course receiving uh the its share of
that so it will match one for one dollar
uh for dollar uh if we raise a private
donations or
um State funds in the future but it uh
you know protects Georgia's number one
economic sector agriculture spans water
quality
wildlife habitat and green space around
our are developing Metro areas and you
know we um you see this beautiful
Farmland out there and it's just got
prohibited for a lot of small farmers
to uh to not be tempted to develop sell
their land for apartment complexes
commercial and this just really keeps a
great balance it's a great voluntary
program
and um and and I just think it's
something that Georgia needs uh this
year and uh it just really gives
priority to those type lands uh that are
threatened for development so uh I asked
your Fable consideration on SB 220.
if there's uh any questions I'll be

199-199
set up a 199 by Senator Estevez the
sixth and others to be tallied act two
amend article 3 chapter 18 and title 45
of the official to George annotated
related state employees plan counsel so
it requires such counsel to establish
health savings accounts and to
continually provide for education or
salary reductions for such accounts this
bill Landry for the committee on health
that committee recommends that this bill
to pass by rules committee substitute
chairman Chuck Martin is recognized to
present the bill
thank you thank you Mr Speaker ladies
and gentlemen let me first address the
rule substitute this is the same bill
that you've had out of committee there
was a scrivener's error on line 26 uh
the date was improperly reflected in the
previous version as 2024 it should have
been 2025 that's how it came out of the
Senate that's how it came out of
committee somehow it got changed so just
to address the reason for the rule
substitute it was to fix the scriveness
era now to the meat of the Bell there's
not a year I've been down here where we
haven't had somebody in the employee uh
of George or TRS or ER has come to us
and want to enhance the retirement
system generally that always costs money
it always costs somebody we have a bill
this afternoon ladies and gentlemen that
weekend pass and we can pass it and it
does not cost money and it is good for
our employees this will allow us to
implement a health spending account this
is different from a health saving
account a use it or loses use it or lose
it type benefit that happens this is
dollars that would be pre-tax that you
can save will you not pay federal state
income tax you don't pay FICA on it and
then you can spend it on your health
needs if you're part of a high
deductible insurance plan about five to
seven percent of our employees in the
state are part of that plan now we
suspect that would go up when this tax
benefit is in order so what we have here
is a situation where people can put
money aside and pay for their health
care costs with pre-tax dollars that's a
big deal I want to thank Senator Estevez
for bringing that to us out of the
Senate and allowing me to bring this to
you today so very simply put this is all
enabling and it asks our
department at the state to put the plan
together so that folks can have pre-tax
dollars to pay for health the last thing
I would add is when you get to be 65
without penalty you can use these funds
for other reasons so Mr Speaker this is
a good enhancement that we want to bring
to our employees the university system
offers it to their employees and their
system now and this will save this will
save Untold dollars for our um our
employees across the state that are able
to take advantage of with that I'll
answer any technical questions that I'm
able to
gentlemen yield to your neighbor
chairman Williamson to your right
Mr speakers absolutely for a question
yes sir is it not for the truth that not
only save the employee tax dollars it
also is portable should they lose leave
employment and they can take that plan
with them absolutely and I thank the
general for the question yes this is
this goes into their health savings
account so this is their money to
control and um if they if they leave the
employee at the state they can take that
with them further in in reality it saves
the state money as well because any
dollars that go into this plan the state
would not be uh responsible their
portion of FICA on that also because
it's pre-tax money this this just allows
our employees to Pro pay for medical
expenses with pre-tax dollars quite
frankly it allows the federal government
to help us pay
um help our employees pay for their
health care costs no further questions
Mr Speaker I'll yield the well
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question be in order the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to withdrawing the
committee substitute the chair has done
the committee's substitute is withdrawn

pro-law enforcement bill that will allow

greatly narrowed the scope of the bill
just the law enforcement officers as
opposed to public employees why was the
bill narrow just because I think all
public employees should otherwise
deserve the protections this bill
provides sure so the bill was narrowed
the bill sponsoring the Senate the great
Senate rules chairman Matt brass had hit
the original intent of the bill and the
the reason he brought this was a
constituent issue related to Law
Enforcement Officers so we worked
together to craft a more more narrow
tailored bill that addressed his
concerns thank you
gentlemen yield for one more question I
will representative Hutchinson to your
right in the back towards your back does
the gentleman yield I will
so piggyback on my colleague's question
I had a I had a client that found my
home address and sent me dead animals to
my house is there any way we can expand
this to cover therapists
uh well again this bill uh if you have a
legislator wants to bring another
measure certainly that would be up to
them I do believe uh that certain
government employees judges and actually
I believe state legislators can request
their their address to be removed from Q
public but this would make sure the law
enforcement can do so and that's what
Senate Bill 215 is here for today
Mr Speaker if there's no are there any
further questions gentlemen's yield of

good afternoon colleagues I know that
the hour is getting late so I will try
to move through this very quickly this
is the house substitute of Senate Bill
26
lc47-2473s from Senator Dulles all
um I will just do a quick read through
of the bill section one establishes
the Georgia Electric Vehicle
manufacturing commission the reason that
this commission is being informed is to
continue the work in progress made by
the Electric Mobility Innovation
Alliance that is basically sunsetting
and this will allow the commission uh to
be able to provide a significant amount
of what I'll call leadership within the
EV industry which is something that We
Have Heard On and On Again in terms of
our want and our need to be able to
provide significant leadership not just
in our state but across the country in
electric vehicles and I will just say on
this on as an aside hopefully in
autonomous vehicles and then also in air
taxis in section two which was the
original part of the bill this is
effectively
permitting certain agencies and
authorities to meet on a virtual basis
versus meeting in person essentially I
could boil this bill down to section two
which would be if the Quorum is in a
virtual State then the meeting may occur
virtually assuming proper public notice
and the public is giving all due ability
to be able to participate
if the Quorum is physical the meaning
will have to be physical and then
ultimately the public will be able to
participate in a public forum Mr Speaker
that is the extent of SB 26 I asked for
my colleagues favorable consideration

for each participating student this bill
ever refer to the committee on education
that committee recommends this bill do
pass by rules committee substitute
chairman Todd Jones is recognized to
present the bill chairman Jones
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues I'm here to present
SB 233
lc491458s which is a committee rules
substitute
this is a pretty big day and excited
about being in front of you for the
Georgia promise scholarship act this is
a face effectively an opportunity for
the state to take the next step in terms
of doing something that my Public School
Mentor for the last 22 years always told
me
and that's this
put the child at the center of every
decision you make in K-12
and I've been fortunate enough for 22
years to be able to do that and today I
think we have an opportunity with SB 233
to do exactly that
the voucher effectively has five key
components but before I get into the
components I want to mention to you a
couple of things
it has been narrowly defined in terms of
our our ability to provide this type of
opportunity and choice to the students
within the state of Georgia more
specifically this is being provided to
the families who attend the bottom 25 of
public schools in the state of Georgia
so this is a chance to say to those
children
to those families
we are here to give you an opportunity a
choice to be able to go to an
alternative
to be able to do something at home or
through hybrid that will allow you to be
able to extend the educational
opportunity
we've been fortunate within the
education committee and I'd like to
thank the chairman
to be able to have former
superintendents
Public School teachers members of the
Board of Education
to be able to come together and
formulate this bill
this bill truly hits the mark in so many
places and let me give you the five that
I would like to focus on today
first in terms of the participating
student
a question had been asked a
participating student and their
eligibility what does that mean
a student must attend two consecutive
counts at their assigned Public School
for those who do not know we take
account generally speaking in October
and March of each year
so what we're saying is is that they
must be there continuously I want to
stress continuously for two counts
typically it'll be October March
but it could be sometimes March October
but what we're saying there is for a
full year
for the parent the parent must reside in
the state of Georgia for an entire year
reside in the state of Georgia for an
entire year and must also commit to not
enroll their child full-time in the
public school system must commit not to
stack what do I mean by not stacking
they may not take an SSO many of you
consider that to be a goal scholarship
they can't take a special needs
scholarship
these are the things that we wanted to
ensure that we again narrowly focused on
what this bill is going to do in terms
of providing for choice and opportunity
in terms of funding
this is an important thing in terms of
we did not touch education funding
but rather we said this is based on
appropriation this would be a line item
from an appropriation made by this body
and then also our colleagues on the
other side of the third floor and then
ultimately the governor of our state and
it would provide for sixty five hundred
dollars on an annual basis
accountability there have been so many
comments made and frankly good comments
and constructive comments made in terms
of how do we ensure that the taxpayers
money is being appropriately used how do
we make sure that the students that are
in this program are basically getting
the education they need and how can we
be confident
well I think we've been able to hit that
and we've hit it strongly there will be
reporting on an annual basis back to the
commission
that reporting will be both of a
financial nature and then also of an
achievement nature
the students that participate in this
voucher program and this includes
homeschool students hybrid students and
private school students will be tested
more than our public school students I
want to say that one more time
they will be required on an annual basis
to take a norm reference test
every year we do not do that to our
public school students but you will see
in the accountability section there's a
choice between going the norm reference
test or what the public school gives in
that particular grade year of course the
most I'll say famous one is the third
grade year
from a transparency standpoint the
commission is required to put the
reports up
it's going to include both aggregate
data and personally delimited data so
we're going to know from each School the
individual when did they attend what
their attendance was what their
achievement was how much of the account
did they use from a homeschool point of
view very similar
and that leads to the account
a question was asked how is the account
done please think of your HSA or
something similar this is third party
administered that money is not fungible
it does not go to the parent but rather
it sits as an approved account that may
only be used
for Approved expenses that are made by
the commission the commission will
delineate what are approved expenses may
they be an accredited private school
may they be a textbook may they be any
type of supplement
speech therapy Ock therapy and up to 500
of Transportation
we are confident that with the help of
so many stakeholders we have put
together the narrowest but we think
going to be a very effective Choice
program
and we hope
that once this is implemented people
will see that we are able to
cross-spectrum and make sure that this
type of accountability and transparency
truly lifted this program to be the best
in the nation Mr Speaker that is the
review of sb233 I asked for your
favorable consideration and Mr Speaker I
would stand for questions
gentlemen is yielding for questions uh
let's see
chair recognizes will park right out to
your left in front of you thank you Mr
chairman does the gentleman yield
yes Mr whip is it not true that in the
past 20 years public education in the
state of Georgia has been underfunded by
at least 20 billion dollars and per
pupil spending is now ranking 38th in
the country
what park I want to look at it just
slightly different than that in my mind
we have fully funded QBE uh the last
four years we are now aggressively doing
I would say not just the right thing in
literacy but also in compensation our
teachers now if you factor in the cost
of living are in the top five of our
Union and then in addition to that our
school systems all 180 cumulatively sit
on over six billion dollars in reserve
which means they have more money in
reserve than the state of Georgia the
eighth largest economy in our country
and the 24th largest economy in the in
the world this gentleman for the yield
yes so in understanding and admitting
the fact that systemically we have
underfunded our schools for decades
which has had a generational impact is
it not true that this bill would further
harm and take money away from rural
schools in particular especially because
in in parts of Rural and South Georgia
there are no no private schools that
accept vouchers
is that not true I would disagree with
that and for two reasons Mr whip first I
was privileged to be the K-12
Appropriations chair and I saw
consistently per capita spending that
was say double of my home school
district sometimes two and a half of my
home school district yet my home school
district had I'll say
far superior outcomes than the ones that
were spending 2x 2.5 x
does a gentleman yield for a final
question yes is it not true that some of
the largest public education
organizations in Georgia from Georgia
Association of Educators the
professional association of Georgia
Educators strongly opposes this bill
because of the harm that it would cause
the public education in the state I
can't speak for those associations but I
know this based on the incremental
funding that when you look at the
voucher and you look at the funding that
would remain with the school system
meaning the local
would stay 100 with them the federal
would stay 100 with them the non-qe
would stay 100 with them then we can say
with confidence and we also have this
affirmed by uh Mr or Dr Dorfman the
state's Economist that a vast majority
of school districts on a per capita
basis will actually have an increase in
funding not a decrease in funding and
furthermore I think for the rural School
District or any of the districts that
have schools in the bottom 25 percent we
then would have in my opinion if people
chose to do this a better student
teacher ratio which I would hope would
produce better student outcomes because
ultimately we put the student at the
center of everything that we do would
you do it for one final of course Mr
whip
again and saying we want to put students
first perhaps it'd be best to listen to
teachers who teach our students and try
and put them first every day in the
classroom thank you sir thank you Mr
whip
gentlemen yield yes sir
chair lady silcox stay on the center
aisle has a question
does the gentleman yield yes
representative
isn't it true Mr chairman that this
could also serve as an economic
development tool for people to move in
areas of the state where there's New
Economic Development projects but not
always great schools to support those
projects by allowing people to use their
funds in alternative ways to educate
their children
I do believe the downstream implication
will be absolutely a lift of I'll say
all boats Rising with a rising tide and
from an economic development standpoint
I think the data would show from a
Realty standpoint and from where
business want to park themselves because
getting employees in is very important
as absolutely you could see this that
way absolutely thank you
representative fry to your left is
recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman
yield yes representative
isn't it true when touting your home
District's success that you leave out
the fact that you
probably live in a pretty wealthy part
of the state
with a pretty homogeneous population
that doesn't have the difficulties that
some of the other school districts May
face
representative there is no doubt that
Forsyth county is blessed however in
terms of homogeny my district based on
the last census report had 81
nationalities and I welcome you to come
to my district and I think you will see
that I have several schools that are
majority minority and we're very proud
of that and so I appreciate the question
I appreciate the opportunity to talk
about the diversity in Forsyth County
and also the Excellence that we have in
outcomes in Forsyth County you further
yield yes
can you explain what your version of a
definition of a failing school might be
yeah if you you can go to the website
without the doe publishes on an annual
basis and cpri will be able to provide
that to you it's a weighted algorithm
sir based on achievement schedules
outcomes Etc sure does gentleman for the
yield yes representative are there any
are there any issues that these
so-called failing schools
that
can be solved
by taking students and money away from
those schools well first and foremost Mr
representative I think the premise that
we are taking money away is not a proper
premise and a proper Foundation I think
let's think about this and I want to
make sure I read this so I don't just do
it off you know memory there are 22
elementary schools in Georgia last year
in which at least three quarters of the
third grade students couldn't read on
grade level and another 68 schools were
two-thirds of the three third graders
had fallen behind there were 10 middle
schools where zero percent of the eighth
graders not one child scored proficient
in math and another 28 no more than five
percent of the eighth graders so I would
say continuing to do the exact same
thing and expecting different outcomes
could possibly lead you to a path that
doesn't make sense but what would
possibly make sense is giving the family
an opportunity to have the choice to be
able to say is there an alternative that
would work better otherwise I think
there's an opportunity yeah we will
continue we don't see this as an or we
see it as an and help the public system
and provide choice this isn't an either
or you've seen us going ahead together
we have funded uh seven thousand dollars
of teacher salary increases over the
last four years we have done I think
this year's budget is 13.1 billion into
the public school system we'll continue
to make those Investments absolutely but
at the same time we need to be able to
lift up everyone and give everyone a
choice because I think it's unrealistic
to believe that any entity can address
100 of its target market
thank you one more question uh yes sir
so what do you think is the cause of
those
low reading scores in those schools so I
think if you're going to talk about a
systemic that's going to be a
conversation that you and I should
probably take to the Annie room or maybe
go grab a drink and I don't mean to say
that facetiously I mean that seriously I
think we have a series of different
challenges between birth to four in
terms of what we're doing in the birth
to four area what we're doing in pre-k
what we're doing in terms of being able
to lift up those families that need that
assistance between birth and foreign
Pre-K but there's a series of different
things going on but I know this once
they get to K-12 we got to be able to
provide a system that allows the family
to have an opportunity and I hope it's
the public school system all four of my
children went through public school I'm
an empty nester now but I do know this
being able to provide choice to them
will give them an option and hopefully
be able to lift everyone including the
public school system because my belief
is we will get a better student to
teacher ratio if the vouchers are in
fact accepted
I appreciate your responses okay thank
you Mr representative Mr Speaker I'm
going to yield the well because I know
there's several people who want to want
to speak to this uh bill and I know that
we are short on time thank you very much
sir
the gentleman has yielded the well
and he is correct
here is our posture
those opposed have 30 minutes and those
in favor have 30 minutes
the minority we have a Minority Report
that will be allocated 20 minutes and
chairs time for 20 minutes
at this time the chair will recognize
representative Doreen Carter
to begin 30 minutes
representative Carter
thank you Mr Speaker
you know I love coming to the well I
love coming down here to tell you guys
about good stuff I love coming to the
well talking to encourage you
encouraging you to take care of
yourselves
but today I'm really not happy about
coming to the well you know when I was
elected one of the things that I was so
excited about as a parent at kids in
school at the time was we were actually
going to come down to the Georgia state
capitol and we were going to figure out
how to
transform education in the state of
Georgia
because we know how important education
is
and because the majority the masses of
our students go to public schools and I
I really thought that education
for the people matter
but as I've been on this education
committee
it is abundantly clear
that public education doesn't matter in
the state of Georgia
at the beginning of this session I was
hopeful because our chairman talked
about how his priorities were literacy
and safety
and he said go and find some legislation
be creative be Innovative on how we can
address literacy so we went to work
there were some other people working and
ultimately we came out with a couple
pieces of legislation and y'all I was
happy because finally we were going to
tackle that thing that we knew was going
to make a difference in the lives of our
children because we kept hearing about
how third grade test scores was the
indicator on how many jail cells we were
going to have to increase so I said oh
look at Georgia we're about to tackle
literacy and we can stop increasing the
funding to increase the jail capacity
because we were going to slow that
pipeline down and you know what we
passed a piece of legislation out of
this house it was HB 538 and it is a
really good piece of legislation y'all
but
we didn't fund it
we said let the locals find the money
for those curriculums you know what else
one of the key indicators that made the
difference in those States who have
increased their literacy scores were
literacy coaches and you know that was
the thing that was left out
the literacy coaches why because it was
gonna cost
to much
so here we go
we didn't fund that
but we figured out a way to uh figure
out a way to find some money in the
budget
because it's going to be appropriated
we don't need a physical note
to find sixty five hundred dollars per
student on endless amount of students in
the state of Georgia
from the time they get in this program
today leave High School
we're talking Millions ultimately
billions of dollars that will come out
of the appropriated budget
now mind you they said it's not going to
come out of education budget because
they're not transferring dollars from
education budget
to the voucher
fund
right well let's think about it
let's do some simple math we're going to
talk about the budget let's talk about
your personal budget right so you got a
couple things you've got income and
you've got expenses so unless you have
unlimited income you got just so much
you can do right and then you're gonna
divvy it up well we know what about 54
of our budget goes to education so you
got something left so what's left so
whatever is left we're going to
appropriate that money so that we can
pay for vouchers now if it ends up one
of those years where we're in a
recession and we have living and money
you know what's going to happen we're
still going to have to find those
vouchers yeah but what we're going to do
is we're going to cut the education
budget because that's what Georgia has
done historically when we get our budget
and we need to go here's all our
expenses but here's the income so hold
up we got to balance this budget so how
do we balance the budget we cut the
education budget
but you're right over the last couple
years we had a little Surplus and it
feels good even our personal budgets
when we have a little Surplus right so
what we do we spend a little extra but
some of us who are conservative
in our finances we don't spend
everything we still set a little bit of
the side so we don't start making extra
expenses or going by big things because
you know what did last year might have
been a good year but do we know two
years down the road is going to be a
good year so we try to save some not
here in the state of Georgia let's
figure out how to get the money away so
we can come back and cut the education
budget so for for whoever believes that
you are not going to be taking money out
of your public school because that money
is going to come out that education
budget one way or the other but another
thing I want you to think about so we've
talked about the money but who can
attend there's one group kids who are
not going to be eligible to take
advantage of this voucher that you guys
may or may not pass but you know what
only I Have 112. This concerns me and as
a and some of you who have children and
those you will listen to me help
children that you're trying to do the
best thing for if your student is
enrolled in a school that's operated by
the Department of Juvenile Justice
they're not going to be eligible part of
the thing I think some people don't
understand that people those kids are at
Youth Challenge that are operated by the
Department of Juvenile Justice they're
not criminals they're youth with
challenges so parents send them there so
that they can keep them out of trouble
but if those parents had another option
to do some other type of school they
would be they would send them there but
those kids won't get to go now let's
talk about let's talk about this
the lowest 25 of schools in the state of
Georgia they are outside for the most
part Metro Atlanta so you know what when
we took that map and we looked at the
last time that 25 was uh those schools
were identified and then we took another
map and we looked at where those private
opportunities were
they weren't in those areas where those
kids said they're gonna need those those
uh services so what are we going to do
so we just I think I just heard a
question back there so we're going to
have some influent people move into some
non-afluent areas to ensure that they're
in a school with a low 25 and they're
going to be the ones that's going to
take advantage of that money now the
accountant in me kicked in too so let's
talk about this we want to make sure
that these these schools are financially
solvent tell me how will you know if a
school or a system or a service that's
the provider is financially solvent if
they've only been in business one year
you absolutely know that most businesses
fail within the first three years so why
not extend it to three years because I'm
gonna tell you another reason a business
that's only been in in operation a year
first of all I want to have financial
statements after that first year
when I run my accounting departments I
end a year is basically on the calendar
year December it's the 20th of January
before I can get December closed then
I've got to come back and reconcile and
make sure that I close for the year so
it's it's February March so and then we
got to get to the Auditors y'all there
is absolutely no reason why we would
send our children to a system that has
not been proven while they're in a
system that we're contested continuously
try to destroy guys come on join me and
vote no let's get rid of these vouchers
let's come together let's fix our public
schools because I believe in the bottom
of your heart Public public education
really does matter thank you Mr Speaker
I see you're the well
lady has yielded the well
representative Howard is recognized to
speak to the bill representative Howard
we'll I'll have to representative Howard
my my mistake my mistake
I do have an order
representative Roman is
is recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
um good afternoon colleagues forgive me
if I Stumble a little bit I have been
fasting for like 10 hours but
um
thank you
so as a freshman we are inundated with
information a lot of times we are told
how to vote we're not really 100 sure
how to vote sometimes and I completely
and totally understand that but the
reality of the situation is that our
district sent us here and each and every
single one of our districts has unique
needs
and so I'm sharing this map with you
because this map shows what counties are
going to benefit the most and what
counties are going to be drained of
funding
look at that map
how many of y'all have districts in blue
and how many of y'all have districts in
red
the folks in red are seeing a decrease
in money within those school systems
so I ask you
for those who are asking you to vote Yes
on this bill
do they live in the blue county is the
red counties
and so I'm not going to take too much
time here but I do want to point out
that you've heard this argument multiple
times but I wanted to show it to you
though that money is going from our
districts to other districts and we need
to be able to vote for the districts
that sent us here because at the end of
the day those are the people that we
have to answer to and last but not least
I want to ask you
do you really want to vote against one
of the largest employers in your
District
I know I personally don't want to and I
hope you'll join me as well thank you
I yield the well lady had lady has
yielded the well
representing Ogden Union is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues today I Rise Against SB 233
as a naturalized U.S citizen recently
elected to this body I feel it's
important to speak on this matter
which is about to make a historical
impact on our future because what we
decide today will become a historical
document on how we educated our kids
I stand here because I'm a product of
public education growing up in the UK
and Nigeria and here in the US my wife
proud parents of three kids that are
benefiting from Gwinnett County Public
Schools
last week I attended the Gwinnett County
school board meeting
and I saw the great job that Dr Calvin
watts is doing in growing our specialty
schools we had updates from a few
schools we're next schools of
mathematics Science and Technology
Maxwell High School International
transitions Center the presentations was
one of Promise where a student from each
one of those schools spoke of their
journey and aspirations because of our
public because our public education is
working
I also was proud to see recognitions of
teachers and Educators at McConnell
Middle School
Brookwood High School and five Fox
Middle School
I myself as an educator
taught as an adult instructor in
Community College University I know the
value of a good public education giving
you a strong Foundation
I start by saying this is not a good
bill
this is not a good bill this is not a
good bill
and I say that after citizen education
committee meetings I did not see any
provisions for the following items one a
fiscal note
you cannot pass a bill that requires
funding without forecasting your
estimated annual budget I know this
because I've been a strategic planner
for over five years
the voucher will allocate sixty five
hundred dollars per student
since the author of the bill referenced
Arizona and Indiana that passed similar
bills I looked up the numbers
and for those States Arizona spent seven
thousand dollars on thirty thousand
students which amounted to 200 million
Indiana spent 5500 on 40 000 students
which amounted to 240 million well let's
do the math
at 6 500 let's do some mathematics we
take the average of the both States it
comes to about 35 000 people students
receiving 6500 multiplied will give you
approximately 230 million
according to the Georgia budget and Pub
policy Institute analysis
this voucher diverts public funds from
schools serving majority black students
and majority living in poverty
this is a reminder of Brown versus Board
of Education which was pivotal and
desegregating public schools it made
education accessible to all and this
bill does not
this voucher bill
reduces the amount of funding that our
Public Schools could use to support good
bills like HB 538 the literacy bill
which would cost 80 to 90 million
dollars
two and a half times less than this
expensive voucher bill
Arizona projected that their bill will
cost them 1.5 billion over the next
decade siphoning money away from the
public school system the new governor
is looking to reverse their voucher lore
two fail in schools we talk about our
Public Schools failing but there's an
assumption that all private schools are
passing schools
we should do our due diligence and use
the same terms of measurement in testing
admission curriculum and retention of
students before trying to allocate
resources to any private schools
the terminology in the bill
that families in the bottom 25 according
to the college career Readiness
performance index
States the states are currently measure
will qualify
72 of these students are black and over
half are directly certified for free
lunch
let's talk about the laws of probability
a subject that those that like math
follow along
if we take 10
private schools that are passing and
roughly 50 of those are failing
and we take five students
multiply them by 10 in the schools that
are passing five good students from from
public schools
we get 50 students that are likely to
succeed
and then if we say two students from the
failing schools we get 2 times 50 which
is a hundred which is 50 more that are
likely to succeed
but if we take resources and we allocate
them and make those fill in schools
so-called failing schools passing
schools
and we take the same number of five
times fifty and
um
and for the school we amount to 250
students which is 200 more than those in
the private schools
I say
we need to figure out a strategy and sit
down and figure out how to increase
funding for our schools our Public
Schools
lastly I want to stand by saying
my naturalized country
my punch of origin in Nigeria we have a
saying Nigerians never carry last in
Georgia we need to have a saying Georgia
must always carry first we can only
carry first by saying no to SB 233 by
saying no by funding uh programs in our
public schools by saying no by
supporting our kids including
transgender kids
by saying no by supporting bills for us
kids for school lunches and by saying by
providing resources that private schools
receive to Public Schools say no on SB
233 and I yield the well
gentleman has yielded wet the well
representative is recognized to speak to
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and and good
afternoon colleagues I rise today in
opposition to SB 233 and ask this body
two questions
how much time have we actually spent
listening to families and children
attending schools in the bottom 25
percent and will this bill do the most
good for children attending those
schools in Georgia well I have listened
I run an education non-profit that
serves under-resourced high school
students and have been in living rooms
and sat at kitchen tables to listen to
our parents our Guardians and most
importantly our students
the children this bill attempts to serve
are likely to live in poverty these are
children who lack stable housing
these are children who come to school
with empty stomachs
these are children whose parents work
multiple jobs and still feel like
they're barely getting by
to my friends in the chamber who serve
rural parts of Georgia think about the
families you work so hard to represent
and how similar these barriers to access
are for your District's children
the average K-12 private school tuition
in Georgia is roughly twelve thousand
dollars
twelve thousand dollars almost twice as
much as the voucher in this bill
provides
for poor families disposable income is
rare not to mention the short supply of
quality private schools in rural areas
of our state
so who really stands to benefit from
this Voucher Program
the winners are the privileged few
families who have the means to make up
the tuition difference
the losers
hundreds of thousands of families who
will be presented with a choice that is
virtually Out Of Reach
The Biggest Loser
Georgia schools that now have the
impossible task of serving a
concentrated pool of our most vulnerable
children
create an even more impossible
conditions for improvement and success
SB 233 will severely harm these public
schools by diverting public funds to
private schools making it harder to
recruit and retain teachers pay for much
needed social workers and guidance
counselors
support mental health services offer
free and reduced lunch and provide
quality after school program among other
difficulties
is this really the best solution for our
children
this past December there was a tragic
shooting at Atlantic Station that took
the lives and futures of two children a
12 and a 15 year old a few weeks later I
visited with the student in my program
who was shot in the leg that night
her mother Harriet was by her side while
we shared breakfast and discussed ways
to ensure that these tragedies stop
occurring
I asked my student why are these things
happening and what can I do to help
she said we need more
more after school programs
more teachers who are supported and stay
more counselors who listen and help
she said she looks around and feels like
it doesn't matter her school her future
and sometimes even her life
back in 2019 a similar voucher bill was
proposed and it would have required 48
million from taxpayers in year one
rising to a maximum of over a half
billion dollars in 10 years
we should not be diverting resources to
support private interests that undermine
Georgia's public schools especially our
schools most in need that need more not
less
let's move Beyond false hope and false
choices in favor of better outcomes for
our underserved children and families
and vote no to SB 233 thank you Mr
Speaker
gentlemen is yielded the well
representative parishes recommend is
recognized to speak
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I rise
today to quickly speak to you about
Senate Bill 233
because specifically I want to address
how School vouchers hurt George's
families School vouchers are government
subsidized scholarships that put private
schools ahead of public schools the idea
seems good that vouchers provide
families with more choices when they're
when it comes to their children's
education however in reality School
vouchers have been shown to have
negative consequences particularly for
most Georgia families instead of
assisting most Georgia families this is
a gift to our most well-off Georgians
one of the biggest problems I have with
school vouchers is that they divert
public funds away from public schools I
liken it to in committee I talked about
how you know it's like if you got a
house and your house has got an
electrical problem it's ten thousand
dollars to fix the electrical problem
instead of you taking that ten thousand
dollars and fixing the house you go and
rent an expensive high-class apartment
and decide oh going to live in this now
you got both of them to pay for so we're
at a place where we really need to make
sure that we take care of George's
children
when you look at the data that is direct
that is there is a direct correlation
between the number of students who are
living in poverty and our school's
achievement scores instead of diverting
money away from our Public Schools we
should be investing in them just like
House Bill 538 uh takes us when Public
Schools lose funding it's the students
and the teachers who suffer we know that
we are facing huge challenges in teacher
recruitment Georgia's public school
teachers already regularly come out of
their own pocket to pay for many things
SB 233 would provide 65 000 6500 in
Georgia taxpayer funds to subsidize a
student's private school tuition cost
that will not do it it's cost like ten
to twelve thousand dollars to go to Pub
a private school poor people do not have
that kind of money I Know You Know Rich
poor and uh below 20 poor they're two
different pores everyone
um there are zero Financial
accountability in this bill either
for the private schools that stand to
benefit from them or from the parents
who will receive the 65 hundred dollar
checks each year this money could be
used for a child to attend a school that
is not fully accredited whose teachers
are not even required to hold a
four-year degree and much less an
education degree
I'm going to get to the end of this
finally I must repeat that school
vouchers do not address the root causes
of poor educational outcomes families
face many challenges that we as the
Georgia state house can address which
affect their children's education such
as poverty lack of Access to Health Care
and unstable housing these issues cannot
be solved by simply sending a child to a
different school instead we need to
fully and equally invest in our public
schools and support families so that
they can provide their children with not
only a quality education but the basic
support all children need to be
successful in conclusion School vouchers
in Georgia hurt our most vulnerable
families they divert funds public funds
away from public schools come with
hidden costs and are not accountable to
the same standards as public schools
lead
they lead to increased segregation
I'll repeat that they lead to increased
segregation and do not address the root
causes of poor educational outcomes SB
233 is wrong for our schools wrong for
our families and wrong for our state
instead of supporting School vouchers we
should invest in public schools and
supporting families so that all children
have access to a quality education thank
you Mr Speaker and I feel the well
lady has yielded the well
now representative guy
you're recognized and speak to the Bill
thank you for your patience
thank you Mr Speaker
and to my colleagues that are gathered
in the room today
I Rise to oppose this bill this voucher
bill
233
and I'll do that for many reasons
first of all
I don't think the bill will accomplish
what the author's good intentions of
helping those who are economically
disadvantaged according to line 33 in
the bill
I've spoken over the last few days
with friends and closer and one close
relative
whose household household income
is in the mid six figures
mid six figures they in 200 300 000
annual household income
and I will tell you today that they are
chopping at the bits
because they see this sixty five hundred
dollars coming
and they want to take advantage of it
which is ridiculous because it's not
designed even though they are close
relatives of mine it's not designed for
those children who can afford School
private school as a matter of fact as a
matter of fact one of these uh
individuals uh that child is in pre-k
now and has been approved and
accepted to a private school for
kindergarten but if this bill passes
they're going to qualify for this
voucher which again I think is
ridiculous
it's not accomplished it's contrary to
what I think the intentions are the good
intentions of the authors have
that's one of my objectives that's one
of my concerns but a greater concern is
that this voucher Bill s b 233 it allows
private schools to accept taxpayer
dollars while according to lines 181
through 183 they can maintain Creeds
practices and admissions policies that
has the potential of prohibiting and
denying admissions to qualified students
and I think that is called
discrimination
thirdly it is my understanding that
private school teachers are not held to
the same standards as public school
teachers as it relates to certifications
if that be the case how can we justify
using State taxpayer funds to pay their
salaries when at the same time we are
cutting budgets for paraprofessionals
and debating about whether to fund
literacy coaches
this is a bad Bill
with no fiscal note
and unspecified accountability
it's bad because rural Georgia where
counties where there are no private
schools
those young people will have no options
if we want to improve and help the
students in Georgia why not give this
same Financial considerations with
accountability to our Public Schools it
is for all of these reasons and many
more that time will not permit me to to
discuss that I would not vote for this
bill and I would ask you to do the same
amen
amen
the gentleman's time has expired
and he has yielded the well now we'll
move on the time has expired now we'll
move on to the uh those speaking in
favor
chair recognizes representative Hilton
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and distinguished
colleagues today I rise in full support
of Senate bill 233.
Senate Bill 233 provides a critical
Lifeline of Hope
across our state to families who are
trapped in failing schools
public education as we've heard is not
an either or proposition
we can both give families school choice
while also focusing our continued
efforts to support public education this
is not an either this is not an or this
is an and
why are we here today
this is the farthest an Esa bill has
gotten the farthest
and I would submit to you it's because
for the better part of four years
politicians
have been telling families sit down
we've got this we know best in your
child's education and for the better
part of four years those politicians
have been voted out of office by those
parents who say no we know what's best
in our child's education
this moment is a historic opportunity
for our state to take a steps towards
modernizing our education system
allowing parents to the power to choose
and customize an education that fits
best their own child's needs instead of
a top-down
one-size-fits-all system we can move
together in a Grassroots approach that
is inclusive and respects the dignity
and unique Gifts of every single child
some students need specialized attention
a different teaching method a specific
Curriculum by giving families more
options we are not only improving
educational opportunities but we're
giving every child an equal opportunity
to succeed
as you know Georgia is home to some of
the best schools in the nation I would
be remiss if I did not recognize our
incredible teachers and administrators
who are on the front lines fighting for
our children every day
personally I am the product of both
public and private education and I'm
eternally grateful for the teachers in
my life
and I'm grateful my parents had the
choice
but unfortunately not every child in
Georgia has that choice
as the chair of the education policy
subcommittee I can tell you that public
education has never been more funded in
the history of our state
QBE is fully funded
we are now consistently giving teachers
much needed pay raises
and public schools have significant
reserves on hand totaling almost six
billion dollars on their balance sheet
in our committee we heard heartbreaking
testimony from students and parents who
are Desperately Seeking a lifeline
we heard from a young student
who literally has rats
rats y'all falling from the ceiling
that's problematic
but here's what's really problematic
that school system has a hundred million
dollars in reserve and rats are running
through the school
we heard from a mother who wanted to
send her son to a local micro school
with a cost of eighty five hundred
dollars a year
she was so desperate to get her son a
better education
she went out into her community and
literally knocked on doors asking for
money for her child
businesses and individuals stepped up
and she raised money for her son to have
a better life
on an almost routine basis we see on
social media videos of kids fighting
teachers and dangerous conditions in
schools
this does not need to happen
SB 233 allows students to escape these
conditions while also giving us the
flexibility to address needs in
education
if you're like me you've heard you've
received dozens of emails on Senate Bill
233 let's walk through real quick three
myths and three realities
myth number one Senate Bill 233
defunds public education
here is the fact
public education is funded by three
buckets local state and federal dollars
under SB 233 State dollars will follow
your student while local school systems
get to keep their local share without
the associated expense
all school systems
will benefit financially from this when
their children take advantage of this
program
myth number two Senate Bill 233 lacks
accountability I want to applaud
chairman Irwin
chairman Jones chairman dubnick leader
Wade This House made significant
improvements to this bill already a
great bill that came over from the
Senate to add even more accountability
annual audits annual testing annual
graduation rates student data based on
grade level gender and race the student
finance commission will have the
authority to conduct random audits on
annual basis
and monitor the in fiscal Integrity of
this program
any evidence of fraud can be turned over
to the Attorney General's office for
prosecution
this is tight we have it on lockdown
finally myth number three
Senate Bill 233 does not benefit our
rural community
fact
the reality is that there are private
schools and almost every County of our
state
the beauty of an Esa program
is an Esa is more flexible
allowing students to benefit from online
learning programs
home study programs and even dual
enrollment
in this bill there are literally
opportunities for every child in every
corner of our state
now I know one no matter what I say
there are going to be Skeptics out there
school choice is about giving every
child a chance to succeed regardless of
their background or social economic
status
but let's not look just to Georgia let's
look to Florida
they've had an Esa program in place for
years and guess what happened
that program is so successful this past
week
their Senate and House overwhelmingly on
a bipartisan basis expanded their
existing program
I know we're afraid here to do it but if
we do it here in Georgia I can almost
guarantee you we're going to be right
back here in a few years because this
program is going to be that successful
as we've seen in Florida
in closing I believe that every child
deserves the best education possible
and I trust I trust that parents know
what's best for their child and that's
why we need to empower parents
and put them in the driver's seat of
their child's education
so I ask you let's work together
for a brighter future for our children
I urge you to vote Yes on Senate Bill
233
and with that Mr Speaker I yield the
well
the gentlemen has yielded the well
representative Wade is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you
are you ready
representative Wade is recognized
thank you speaker
ladies and gentlemen I appreciate
you all being here and um
this is a special day for me because
I have an opportunity to speak to you as
a person who is advocated on behalf of
public education
for over 16 years as a school board
member in Dawson County schools and by
the way that is in rural
Georgia
even the kids like to say we keep it
rural there if you know what I mean
it's okay I know it's a dad joke but I
got kids that are six and nine so that's
how I roll right now
it's late I'm tired
I'm ready to get home it's my 20th
anniversary today
so
let me tell you to a public educated a
public education teacher and
administrator
she's in her 22nd year
I am a son of two teachers
I was in a public school kindergarten
through third to 12th grade 13 years of
my life
folks
we are a state that has fully funded QBE
for the last five years
QB is currently fully funded
the public school ecosystem has never
had as much money in total as well as
per student ever in our state's history
I am for public education
there are superintendents there are
teachers there are folks that are
texting you they're emailing you with
concerns and I respect those concerns
but I also want you to remember that our
job as a state legislature
and what my belief and what I believe
many of you on both the right and the
left or the Republican side or the
Democratic side believe is that
education is the most important thing
and every single child deserves the best
option
now at the same time that we have fully
funded education in this state we have
seen major improvements in many areas
but if we're all being completely honest
with one another
we also could acknowledge that all
across this state there are some
children
that are not receiving
the best and folks I believe that every
child in this state deserves the best
educational opportunity and that
ecosystem needs to acknowledge what we
did with special needs
I was told by folks that have been here
back when the sb10 and sb47 bill was
passed that it would decimate
the public education sector in the state
and I look I understand
we all have concerns about something new
but that program has served a vital
purpose for over 5500 special needs
students some of the most fragile Among
Us
and it is not crippled the school
systems in this state in fact I would
argue that has helped the schools serve
the students that are still in their
districts who have those special needs
they are getting better service because
the students that weren't being met are
no longer causing the issue for those
students that remain
I also want to speak to you from this
regard and I'll be short but I want you
to really hear me
choice
is important
in the 21st century we have to ensure
that children have the best options
we have narrowly tailored this bill and
I would argue that this is the most
well thought out balanced Approach at
this issue to ensure that we are doing
things in this state that will give us
the opportunity to compare how a student
performs it receives this scholarship
versus a student that is in our
classrooms it is helping those students
in which when I was on the gsba
board and I was a president who traveled
this state to many of the parts of this
state who have schools that are in the
lowest 25 percent of performance when
those mothers and grandmothers were
coming to me saying I need another
option
I love my community I love my teachers I
love my principal they're just not
getting the job done
that's real talk I get it
these folks need an option
to those school systems who have one or
two schools in their District that are
on this list
we already have an opportunity for you
at home to provide intra District
transfers for those families that want
to go to another school
within your own District but I have
heard from parents and community members
that they have been told that that's not
an option for them the adults cannot
figure it out they can't make that work
that concerns me as a person that
believes that every child needs to
receive an opportunity to best
meet their expectations for their young
ones
folks
I'll wrap up with this
I hope if you are a person who's in this
building that is struggling with this
choice
that you'll think about children and not
adults
I think I hope that you will realize
that this is going to be the next step
in ensuring that Georgia provides every
child the best opportunity
to grow and to thrive
I'm honored to be a floor leader for
governor Kemp
I've enjoyed being able to be a part of
that
effort Governor Kemp is fully funded
education with the legislature's help
Governor Kemp appreciates the work
of this legislation and Governor Kemp
supports this bill
I hope that you will give that your
highest regard because he is a governor
who has done much for the public
students public school children in this
state and children in every corner with
that I hope you will cast your vote Yes
and I yield the well thank you
representative Maynor is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you chair and good afternoon
colleagues
I don't know if this bill is going to
pass or not but I do think it's
important for us to talk about it all of
us are here so let's talk about the
elephant in the room
the schools and some are failing some
are not
Ephesians 1 16 says I do not cease to
give thanks
for you that was the lent prayer I did
yesterday at my church
Jesus we're in Lent Jesus spent 40 days
in the wilderness seeking discernment we
are here at the capitol for 40 days
for 40 days we need to discern the
voices of 60 000 people
we sit Rock and swivel in our leather
leather antique chairs
under an actual gold Dome
and we debate on what is good for the
people of Georgia
think about what the kids
in failing school environments are
thankful for
what is a six-year-old child selling
water at a busy intersection with his 14
year old brother thankful for
what about the little girl
who has two parents in prison what is
she thankful for
sixty thousand people are counting on us
to not be bipartisan
they assume based on our party line
we will think like them but we will
always defer to their needs over our
party's needs
now Jesus ultimately did die
after those 40 days but he rose again
Maybe sb233
may give a child an opportunity to rise
I got a call from a constituent that's a
veteran
they said rut Manor remember we don't
leave anyone behind please vote Yes for
SB 233 every child deserves a chance
when I came here I found out quite
quickly
that education was as partisan as Donald
Trump
lobbyists that are against this bill
they roll their eyes at me when they see
me
this bill makes people mad and angry
and they show it to you
now like children in marginalized
communities just like the one that I
grew up in
parents only know what they know
and if you're in an environment
in a failing school it's quite possible
that the parents you're right that is
some of the argument with some people
you're very right parents may not know
how to access
this resource
children across Georgia the whole
conversation today has been about money
money money money money money money
money
a child is a dollar sign I don't think a
child is a dollar sign
children are thirteen thousand dollars
roughly
six thousand per child from the state
and roughly seven thousand from other
sources
now when you go home
you have plenty of options children in
unfortunate situations have no options
in Atlanta I have the highest energy
burden District in the city and that
means there are families that don't even
have utilities on
how do they do homework without even
utilities
so imagine you don't have utilities you
go to the same school in your
environment
how would your eyes open up if you went
to another environment when I was little
I used to go to the downtown library it
was so big it was massive
because when I got off of the school bus
I ran home from crackheads
so when I went to the library I thought
I was somewhere amazing and to this day
I value education because
of my experience of going somewhere I
had never been before a library a public
library
children walk into schools every day
and on the board it says welcome to your
school and the schools have their
averages up there so imagine a child
walking into school every day and it
says welcome we are a d school we are in
F School
is that going to make them want to do
more
sb233 is for students students in
schools that are listed in the bottom 25
performance level of all Georgia schools
that is a lot of schools in my district
in fact I have the most charter schools
in my district than any other District
in the state because parents are looking
for options
supporting SB 233 doesn't mean you don't
support teachers in fact I think
teachers put their lives in danger every
single day as well as the school bus
drivers that we learned
sb233 is not against public schools it's
about giving a child an opportunity
everybody is not going to run and use
this resource but if one child uses it
imagine if it was me if one child uses
it it has made a difference for one
child
my mom used someone else's address so I
could go to another school on another
side of town
now imagine I don't know where I would
be if I went to the school in my
neighborhood I really don't
the Georgia Chamber released the report
saying that Georgia has a labor
workforce issue
imagine if we were
using our creativity
in the schools that we have right now
but we aren't because guess what right
now the schools are using curriculums
that are not preparing children for
today's activities
in 1906 we started this system for
factory workers the Bell System came
alive we are past the Bell System we're
past children sitting in a desk
one plus one equals two we are now at in
other countries their Pre-K students are
learning robotics
the issue is not
necessarily we're trying to take money
away from public schools what we're
trying to do hopefully what this will do
is just
make schools
do something different
we're using the QB formula has been the
QBE formula for a long time everybody
knows that that formula is outdated
right
but what do we do about it
right now our budget for education is 12
billion dollars that's the same
operating budget as McDonald's
now if you went to McDonald's every day
and got a burnt hamburger and burnt
Fries Are You Gonna keep going back to
that McDonald's
I know that leader Beverly said no he's
not going
and that's what the children are saying
I don't want to go where the burnt
hamburger is I don't want to go where
the burnt Fries Are
I want a fresh hamburger I want a fresh
education I want something different
just give me something different I am
actually screaming because I am the
child that will benefit from this there
are some things that are not all the way
right for this and we can fix that later
but if one child one child can benefit
from this then you should vote for sb233
and for all the lobbyists you do not
have to roll your eyes at me when you
see me
because it's good it's another subject
that might come up that you we might
agree on but just because we don't agree
on this and this is for my colleagues
too you do not have to treat me so badly
because I am trying to help the children
in my community and speaker I yield the
will
lady has yielded the well
representative Martinez is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker you know we're uh we're
hearing all the representatives today
let me tell you another group that this
uh this bill helps my people the
Hispanic Community the Latinos in
Georgia the tenth of thousand students
let me tell you Mr Speaker and I'm going
to be very brief because I know we got
more speakers and it's getting late
I love coming here to the well also
and telling the people especially the
Hispanic Community some good news
as a Latino
that came to this country when I was a
boy
I went to a failing school I went to a
public school
I also went through ESO esol classes you
guys know what ESO is all right I'm sure
you do I've been there I've been there
I'm a product of this bill
I'm a product that's a spell coming to
this country when I was a young boy
for the for my Hispanic community
especially the Latino kids
struggling
in schools
it gives my people
my community a choice
isn't that what we always talk about
choice
Mr Speaker I am pro-school choice
my only regret
is not having this option
when I was a student
that's my only regret I wish my parents
had this option in the early 80s when I
came to this beautiful country
and without Mr Speaker I hear the will
thank you
the gentleman has shielded the well
that concludes all of those that are
opposed
and in favor
with the time that there was allotted to
them
now we'll move on to the Minority Report
but first
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered chair here's none
the previous question is ordered
now we'll move on to the Minority Report
and the chairs time 20 minutes for each
I'll recognize representative David
Wilkerson
to speak to the bill and he can allocate
the time as he sees fit there's a couple
other speakers I think you're aware of
that
representative wilkerson's recognized
thank you Mr Speaker
um I rise today to speak to the Minority
Report to SB 233 uh
I know that we all the kids are the most
important thing I this is my first year
serving an education committee and I've
been very excited that we've talked
about safety and literacy and this
really is a discussion on what is the
best way to make sure the kids are
getting the education they need
we talk a lot about
fully funding QB so I'm going to walk
through the parts of the bill real quick
it is correct that this bill has not
become effective until QBE is fully
funded
however once we start the process
it never stops
so whether QBE stops being funded we're
going to continue to fund this
the second thing is we are funding a
formula from 1985. I'm going to date
myself but if you go back to 1985 the
top movie was Back to the Future Beverly
Hills Cop Rambo Rocky and Cocoon
if you could tell me what cocoon was
about then I'll give you extra credit
but the bottom line is we're funding a
formula that educated kids in 90 1985
and a lot of very smart people have said
that that formula does not work
so we've made a lot of changes to this
bill as we went through the education
committee but if you go to line three
there's been a lot of debate about what
is QBE funding is this enough is this
too much or whatever
the sixty five hundred dollars that were
allocating to QBE is 6 500 no matter
what we do to QBE as far as austerity
cuts
so my plea is that if we're going to do
this which I hope we don't that we say
you can get funding up to 6 500 not to
exceed what QBE is
um that would be one request to change
the second thing is as far as qualifying
for the bill if you go to line 73 this
is all driven by parents and this is not
going to be a large number of students
however if your parents live in another
state and say you're a married student
your military you're married if your
parents are in the military you still
qualify for this if your spouse is
military you do not qualify for this
scholarship so we're going to be leaving
out anybody who moves here that is
married to a service member 21 year old
that's married to an 18 year old Etc
they will be excluded from this I have a
question about foster children will they
be included because foster parents or
not I mean I'm in the in the in the in
the system they may or may not be
included so I just have a question about
that and I'll leave it to the authors
the big thing though for me is if you
look at the board on the left and
forgive my writing but if you look at
the board on the left that's a fiscal
note
it's done by the professionals down here
at the Capitol they talk about what this
bill will do whether it's going to cost
us or whether it won't cost us
on the right is the only type of fiscal
note that I've seen and so if you look
in the bottom left-hand Corner that's my
fiscal calculation for the meeting today
you'll see where I started with the 6
500 and I backed out mathematically what
QBE funding is for a 9th through 12th
grader and I get about thirty six
hundred dollars I took one of the school
systems and I said okay say only 10 of
that school system uses the voucher
that's that's 50 students if 50 students
use that voucher you potentially have
the state spending 180 000 more than
they did
um and so that's 500 times 10 and if you
look at the top right that's some other
notes that I had but the bottom line is
whether you like this bill or not we
need to know the cost because what we're
doing is obligating money to students
making promises to families that we will
have to continue going forward forever
and if we don't know what the cost now
how can we make that promises to
families that their kids will have that
funding to go to private school so with
that I will yield the remainder of my
time to other speakers but I ask us to
please get a fiscal note to make sure we
know what the promise we're making so
make sure we can keep them thank you
gentleman has yielded the well
representative Lisa Campbell is
recognized to speak to the bill
representative Campbell
speaker
colleagues we've all been hearing many
voices today about this bill but I Rise
to speak against Senate bill 233.
because I believe investing in our
public education is the single most
important thing we can do to improve the
lives of all Georgians
I urge everyone to consider voting for
three main reasons number one this bill
takes public funds and hands them over
to private entities
without accountability that protects
parents and kids there's no getting
around that
we've talked a lot about the Hope
Scholarship a smart investment in our
students and this bill uses the same
term scholarship
but do not be fooled this is not a
scholarship program using new funds as
with the lottery in this bill taxpayer
dollars are deducted from our local
public schools QBE allocations that's
where they're coming from and they are
handed out to private entities
this bill proposes a sixty five hundred
dollar taxpayer funded private school
tuition subsidy
the average full-time equivalent for
middle school student allocation in
Georgia is about 2 900 bucks in this
bill we're giving twice that much money
to private schools and to homeschoolers
twice as much than our Public Schools
get for that same child
and even more alarming is the fact that
opting out of public education means
participating parents will also forego
protections for students with
disabilities
background checks for teachers
School accreditation and they have very
little assurance that the private school
they've selected will even accept their
child or will be a viable program
this bill lacks oversight as the new
commission is not required to report the
demographics of students at the
individual participating schools the
assessment results attendance course
completion or even high school
graduation rates
an itemized list of expenditures
approved by is not required either from
the parent Review Committee
number two this bill dilutes funding for
our local public schools who are already
trying to make up for 30 years of
underfunded budgets
proponents of this bill have said local
school districts won't lose money
because the money is following the child
that is simply not true each district
would receive 6 500 less per student in
their allocated QBE funds there's no cap
to the number of students who can
participate no cap for a family and no
cap on the length of the voucher program
it could be used for 12 years
for each student for a whopping seventy
eight thousand dollars per child did
y'all hear that
each child each family could get seventy
eight thousand dollars for their child
that is coming from our Public School
budgets wealthy districts are hurt less
than poor but all public schools will
lose State money to the tune of about
210 million dollars sucked out of our
Public Schools budgets annually and
we're now already seeing the
catastrophic results from taking more
than 11 billion dollars from our public
schools in the last 30 years
I'm here to tell you 30 million dollars
is not fully funding Public School in
any way shape or form and lastly and no
one has talked about this much yet I
think this is absolutely critical number
three voucher programs are known to
decrease student outcomes
they decrease student outcomes
that's the intention of this program
right to improve our students education
but the reality is that vouchers are not
a new brilliant idea they've been tried
in other states
and when they have they're proven to
actually decrease achievement
that's right subsidizing private school
does not improve student outcomes and in
the long-term studies the long-term
studies that have been conducted has
actually decreased the outcomes
repeated studies about your programs
across the country show that vouchers
result in worse test programs in
Milwaukee Cleveland the District of
Columbia
and they found that students who receive
vouchers showed no improvement in
reading or math over those not in the
program
other studies conducted by Fordham
University the U.S Department of
Education The Brookings Institute and
others show long-term voucher programs
cause a decline in academic achievement
that rivals or even exceeds those caused
by natural disasters including the
covid-19 pandemic
I don't know if y'all are hearing this
but after aggregating the test scores
for voucher participants in Indiana
Louisiana Ohio Washington one of these
research described the results as some
of the biggest drops we've ever seen in
test scores in the research community
the worst scores there's AV you we are
advocating for a change for Innovation
but I don't think reduced outcomes is
the change we're looking for
rather than voting for this bill we
could do new things instead unite and
invest in fully funding pre-K in
kindergarten research shows that that
actually does improve our outcomes
providing for professional salaries to
attract and retrain College quality
teachers
you want to get to a lower classroom
ratio let's hire some more teachers
funding literacy curriculum to improve
our embarrassing 40-second ranking this
year and increase professional learning
for educators and fund our high quality
curriculum
this bill does not diminish the rights
of parents to send their kids to the
schools of their choice they can still
do that but it does in fact diminish our
Public Schools and I have to say this
afternoon it has been quite Rich to hear
talk about the importance of choice
but our choice is to fund education for
all kids not just some
and as the great granddaughter of two
Public School teachers
the granddaughter of a Cobb County
Public School teacher for more than 20
years and the daughter of a high school
chemistry teacher I urge you to vote no
on Senate Bill 233 thank you Mr Speaker
and I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
represented Becky Evans
has recognized to speak to the bill
thank you thank you Mr Speaker
good afternoon colleagues
I rise today in opposition to Senate
Bill 233
The Spill would send public funds to our
private schools
with little accountability for the
performance of private schools limited
transparency
and no estimate no estimate
of the program costs
I want to talk about money and values
we're saying it is it is about money and
I think it's because you know our state
and our budget it's our priorities it's
our budget reflects our priorities as a
state
and it is true that education is the
largest proportion of our budget I
recognize that and I'm very grateful for
that
but I want to talk about what we're
choosing to fund and what we're not
choosing to fund with this bill
yes it is true that we have fully funded
QBE for the past four years and we're
I'm grateful for that
but as we've heard earlier QBE hasn't
been uh updated in over 30 years
and we know that there are so many
things that are a part of educating our
children that QBE does not support
at the beginning of this session in the
education committee I remember
we had excellent speakers talking to us
about what we need what we need to do to
improve education we heard from the
Georgia partnership and excellence in
education
one of the things they talked about was
the need for more counselors and in this
budget we appear to be poised to fund
counselors for special education and
gifted students so that's good that's
one challenge I want to see if that
actually makes it in the budget but
others remain counselors are funded at a
ratio of one counselor to 450 students
above the one to 250 students
recommended by the American counselor
Association
we need these counselors so that our
students can have guidance on their
College and Career pathways
this body has recognized our 48th or
49th ranking of those providing Mental
Health Services to Georgians
the mental health parity Act and the
years of expansion this year's expansion
of Behavioral Health reforms that's I'm
hoping that will pass and I'm grateful
for that
but in our schools our state funds
School social workers and one and school
psychologists one for every 2
475 students
and that is above the recommended ratio
of 1 to 250 students for social workers
and one to five hundred for school
psychologists
another thing is Georgia is one of the
six states that doesn't provide extra
funding for low-income students through
the K-12 funding formula
we learned that that we need to provide
a poverty way this was recommended to us
and several of our legislators have
recommended that and that's something
we're choosing not to fund
Transportation costs we learned that the
portion of student transportation costs
covered by the state has shrunk from 50
percent in the 90s to less than 15
percent annually
this expense which also which often
Falls harder on Rural districts limits
the district's Investments of local
funds into the classroom
these yeah so I want to just for take a
look for us up at the map we could talk
about all these other ways we're not
funding schools
but I want to take a look here
um
at this map you see on the board and
this is a map of where we have uh
private schools
in Georgia
and if you take a look at the map 50 uh
the white part is where there are no
um private schools in Georgia the yellow
is where there's one private school so
we need to talk about who will this bill
benefit will it benefit
the students in rural Georgia who need
who who are who
and I think you look at that Mom you say
how how will this bill benefit the
students of rural Georgia when I look at
that map
the other question about QBE is yes this
the bill States uh QBE needs to be
funded in order for this to be
implemented but what about if we go into
recession what will happen with that
will we go uh will QBE
be funded or will our private schools be
funded what will our choice be
so we've talked about the the sixty five
hundred dollars that we're spending per
student what this program will cost
and you've heard estimates of cost from
other uh from other uh uh people
speaking to this bill
but I do want to
have us think about
what we've done with uh our voucher
programs before we currently uh the the
education scholarship
the tax credit scholarship that started
at 58 million we've bumped that up to
120 million
the
this the the the scholarship for
students with edu uh yeah
we've also we're at 30 million for
um
for the the students with disabilities
scholarship what will this increase to
that is what we don't know all right
students thank you thank you everyone
I ask that you please
do not vote for this bill let's fully
fund all these other things instead of
funding
private schools for children where we
have no accountability thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
that completes the Minority Report
now we'll have the chairs time
chair has up to 20 minutes for
Chairman's time
we're now recognize the chairman from
which this bill came chairman Irwin
for the Chairman's time
thank you Mr Speaker what I'd like to do
is uh share this chairman time with the
pro tem if that is okay Mr Speaker
that's your call
yes ma'am yes sir
the speaker Pro Tim of this house is
recognized to speak to the bill well
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr
chairman and I appreciate your efforts
on this legislation
I'm just going to make a couple sort of
off the cuff remarks I I will say that
in 20 years I've served on the education
committee
I've never worked on a voucher Bill I've
only worked the lady will suspend
members please give the member in the
will your attention I know it's been a
Lake debate but this is important give
the lady in the well your attention
thank you I thank you Mr Speaker I have
only worked on legislation to that was
aimed at students in public schools
teachers in public schools including
public charter schools and
um
and and this is the first time and some
might ask well why did you decide to get
involved and it's because it's it's
become clear as over these 20 years that
our state and our constituents and in
particular after covet a couple years of
disruption
there are some of them that would like
another option
and it's not a rejection of public
school usually it's you know family of
three and maybe it's just not quite
working for one you know maybe one
doesn't quite fit in we have public
schools
with 3 000 students in them you know
that's just not for everyone and I'm not
sure we should play King Solomon and be
the ones to decide what you know where
you're going to go and I um but I don't
I don't see it as either you're
supporting Public Schools or you're
supporting other options because it's
not just private schools it's these
micro schools that have emerged and and
homeschoolers who don't really fit the
model or what we thought of 20 years ago
is sort of your traditional
homeschoolers sometimes it's there's
sort of your average mom sometimes it's
the dad who finds that one of their two
kids it's just not quite working and you
know their children come first to them
and who better to know that than the
parent and so after 20 years of um
I I've worked particularly on you all
know public charter schools but I
initiated the dual enrollment with the
move on when ready because you know
that's really just another option that
by the way also uses private colleges
to provide needed services to students
because sometimes the high school just
doesn't one size fit all and I haven't
really found that dual enrollment to be
particularly
controversial
I worked on Hope Scholarship to
allow students who take stem classes the
very challenging stem classes to fulfill
needed careers that they would receive
extra weight while they're in college
sort of akin to dual enrollment and AP
weight oh and by the way at private
colleges and public colleges where
students are on hope so I I think it's
um
mischaracterize it to say that you have
to be for one or the other because
serving on the education committee under
some awesome education chairs including
Brooks Coleman former assistant
superintendent of Gwinnett County or
superintendent former superintendent of
the Year Chris Irwin Rick Rick Jaspers
and now Matt dubnick who chairs the
education Appropriations what all of us
have seen is you know time has evolve
and
education doesn't have to always look
exactly the same but I'll tell you
what's consistent on the education
committee 95 98 of the time all we
really work on is what you think of as
more traditional Public Schools or
Charter Schools so again it's not either
or and Georgia and our nation if you
think about it has a long and strong
record of using tax dollars for public
purposes or goals
utilizing private or non-profit
institutions to provide needed services
to individuals it's not a rejection of
say someone who works for the government
it just means that sometimes it takes an
array of methods to fulfill State goals
in this case education
Pell Grants go to public and private
colleges well they go to the student for
public at public or private colleges the
GI Bill public or private colleges Head
Start private day cares
uh food stamps people use them at public
grocery or private grocery stores WIC
Medicare Section 8 vouchers we found
give folks a public voucher instead of
always having public housing give them a
voucher and let them decide where it's
best to go what best serves their needs
Medicaid we don't hire all the doctors
and PAs and nurse practitioners to
provide services we give people
essentially a voucher through Medicaid
and let them find the private provider
that can best provide their needs if you
look through the budget Community
Affairs and Community Health you'll find
it full of private for-profit and
non-profit providers that provide
services that government alone never
could provide all
and it does it's not a rejection it's
not a you know it's not to say that
having government employees providing
these Services is any less
my children went to public school they
didn't want to go to a charter school
they wouldn't have wanted to go to a
private school but most of us know
a few kids where maybe it just wasn't
the best fit for them and so I will say
that uh well additionally I'll say I
don't say Pre-K students out of 84
000 students in Georgia four years old
receiving a Pre-K voucher half of them
take that voucher to a private Pre-K
provider generally a daycare center and
the other half go to a public school
I've never heard a single one of my
colleagues on the floor or a constituent
complained to me because they weren't
all at the public school and by the way
the private Pre-K providers don't offer
a door-to-door bus service just as as
the public do it's just a different
option that works for some people well
apparently it works for half the Pre-K
parents
our general budget funds 24
367 Georgia college students for nine
hundred dollars yearly teg grants
tuition Equalization grants to take to a
private college
that's out of the general budget just as
this would be and by the way there's no
fiscal note on that because it's
appropriated
a fiscal note just sort of a little
Learning lesson here a fiscal note is
required for a tax bill because a tax
bill is an appropriation in law it
recurs until you change the law you know
we fight over those just about every
year a little bit on the floor an
appropriation I I look at the difference
an appropriation is an addition or
subtraction
Ways and Means uh is is multiplication
and division it multiplies every year
every year you pay it if it's a tax bill
if it's tax law in appropriation it goes
down it goes up there's no fiscal note
here because it's zero until the
Appropriations Committee in the house
the Appropriations Committee in the
Senate and the governor signs the bill
for some amount maybe they decide it's
going to be 50 Children maybe it's going
to be a hundred of these
we don't know that would go through an
Appropriations process
Georgia's budget funds between forty six
hundred and six thousand dollars a year
for Hope private and hope Zell private
yearly
um scholarships to students that attend
our 30 private colleges
um if you don't like using public
dollars and those are public dollars
that are
appropriate well they're appropriated
then
um Matt Hatchett is over there waiting
you know we're going to have the
conference committee let us know if you
want to cut that money out because that
is a voucher going to our 30 private
schools and I'll just remind you there
are constituents too that's why I don't
regret using teg or private hope because
who am I to tell someone that they
shouldn't go to you know Young Harris or
Mercer or these other colleges that also
by the way hire our constituents to
provide these services to our
constituents and I value them I'm a
product of public colleges in Georgia my
children are products of public colleges
in Georgia but they have friends and I
have constituents and so do you that
have utilized these services
um one one of the members mentioned the
special needs scholarship for those with
disabilities in the SSO both of which
use public dollars I will mention that
neither of those programs has the
accountability
transparency and testing Provisions that
Senate Bill 233 possesses I would ask
anyone to demonstrate or to show another
voucher
plan in any state that is as well
crafted narrowly crafted and with as
much transparency and accountability as
this bill and I do thank those on the
education committee that work so hard as
well as the Senate who initiated it and
all of these examples that I'm sharing
with you and I I will close
they they don't necessarily it's not
that they don't support public education
public colleges or public health or all
the other vouchers that we have in our
budget what they do is they expand and
they enhance the reach of state
government to cover the needs and the
aspirations of all Georgians and I would
ask for you to consider voting for
Senate Bill 233 and with that Mr Speaker
I will yield the well
the lady has yielded well
to have him
remainder at a time
is yielded to
a Governor's floor leader
representative will Wade
hey guys good evening
so first a lot of y'all were in the
Annie room and y'all were talking and I
think y'all need to hear something
really important today is my 20th
wedding anniversary
people so thank you
love you Jennifer thank you for all you
do and I know you're taking care of our
our beautiful children
so I want to address a couple things
because you've heard some of you have
heard some information that I I'm not
going to speak negatively of one of our
peers but I'm not sure that they were
made aware of some of the actual things
that we've done
in this house through our education
committee with folks that have deep
background in education from a
superintendent from a former cat
director former teachers
Etc
we have put in this in section
20-2b-4 A few items
this is not going to go into effect
again until
not this next school year but the
following there's going to be a year of
planning to ensure that these things are
met
but we are going to require things like
aggregate data of student attendance and
course completion rates of the eligible
course core courses and the CTA courses
that these students will be receiving in
this school this is an accountability
and transparency piece that I've heard
educational advocates
for over a decades asking for
we'll also continue to ensure
that they will attend a school a public
school first this is not going to allow
somebody that's currently in private
school an opportunity
to come back and circumvent the system
this is to ensure that kids that are in
this city these schools are in the
bottom quartile of performance will have
this option
in lines 162 we're going to comply with
anti-discrimination Provisions they're
going to comply with all health and
safety laws and codes that apply to
private schools
they have to be located in Georgia
folks somebody got up here and told you
a few things that weren't true
I just want it to be factual
I know this body respects facts I'm a
Believer in facts
I also want you to think about this
they are going to ensure
every single year that the funds that
are utilized there's going to be a
report that's going to be given and
submitted to this body
we're going to talk about Effectiveness
and comparisons for for outcomes
we're not going to do this without
considering that this is an actual
better option for students
we're going to have tests I think you
some of you weren't in the room so I
want you to hear this
chairman Jones indicated to you
that there's going to be a norm
reference test every single year we do
not currently require that of our Public
Schools if a student receives this they
will be required to do so and then the
third grade in the eighth grade they
will be taking
the same test that Public School third
graders and 8th graders take so that we
can compare that data
I've heard advocates for years ask us to
do that
we are doing that in this legislation
so I just wanted you to be aware that
that is extremely important to this
house it was extremely important to the
education committee because we believe
that is a proper way to address those
comparative concerns
I understand that there are folks that
are receiving a few messages
and I get it there's a lot of folks that
don't know exactly what's in this bill
but we all have a responsibility to be a
part of analyzing what this is going to
do for constituents and again I just
want to remind you
children should be the center of our
Focus
not adults
I love our teachers
y'all they have been through some of the
toughest times over the last couple of
years
and this state has supported them with
our pay raises
fully funding education now if we want
to have a conversation about updating
QBE I'm there I'm ready
I'm very willing to address that this is
not the time
we're in a period of time which we have
fully funded it and let's continue that
conversation let's gather more
information based on student outcomes
across this state
but I ask you this
if you're a person that still hasn't
decided
think about this
to me this is going to be the most
important point so I hope you will
listen
there are school systems and communities
that are doing a lot
for kids
they get up every day and they try
the teachers try
the families try
the community tries
and they succeed
but they're also parts of this state
that have had struggles
I came from a community that had those
struggles as a kid half my freshman
class
it was a classic
202 of us in 1993.
I graduated with 96 and 96.
that wasn't acceptable
folks there are too many communities
that we have kids that are
yes they're at 100 poverty rate
but they're also at 100 percent not
reading at grade level in third grade
they're 100 not radiant grade level in
eighth grade
those parents are looking for an option
no one is going to require them to take
this if they are completely satisfied
with the school that they are in
and they want to continue to hope that
things are going to get better and that
next teacher the next year is going to
work out or if they repeat repeat first
grade that it's going to get better the
next time
I respect that that those families have
that choice
but if you're that parent that has been
in that classroom
and seen the situation not get any
better
we had a testimony from one of the
colleagues in the Democratic Party come
and talk to us about kids on buses
fighting in schools because the school
buses were overcrowded we we looked at
the school system's data
the school system had
over a hundred million dollars in their
ending fund balance and they can't as
adults figure out how to make the
decisions to ensure that those buses
are not
adequately running so that the kids can
not have to sit in each other's laps
look these are adult issues and we need
to address it but kids
need us to make this an option again I I
believe every every person in here needs
to know that
Governor Kemp appreciates the effort of
both the Senate and in this house
but he really appreciates and he
supports this legislation
because this strikes the balance that
this discussion needs it gives parents
choices
and I hope that you will consider
supporting this edu this I believe
meaningful option that is not going to
decimate public education
it's going to give choice to those that
have been asking for it and I hope that
you will give your vote with that
yield the well thank you

expired

we're going to move on to the

bills the supplemental rules calories so

they're being distributed now
we're almost there
Mr clerk will you read a caption to
Senate Bill
3535 Senate Bill 35 by Senator Meredith
of the ninth and others being titled an
act to amend coach section 42 86 of the
official go to George annotated relaying
the special license plates promoting or
supporting certain worthy agency's funds
or non-profit corporations this bill I
haven't referred to the committee on
motor vehicles that committee recommends
that this bill do pass
by rules committee substitute
the gentleman from the 121st chairman
wiedauer
okay
I like that better anyway
you would do a much better job than he
would have there representative Holcomb
representative Holcomb is recognized to
present the bill I think he's had
something to do with this before thank
you referee Holcomb yes
thank you Mr Speaker
um uh I have been in this situation
before I think it was around seven years
ago when the house was trying to advance
legislation to
um end the backlog of untested sexual
assault kits
um
for whatever reason we had a bottleneck
across the way in the Senate but the
house worked really hard and passed a
bill that made a real difference in the
lives of many Georgians and today I
present to you Senate Bill 35 you may
recognize it this was formerly house
bill 364.
um House Bill 364 is to reform the way
that the state compensates the
wrongfully convicted
this measure gained even greater
importance after yesterday because
the house bill 364 as well as the
individual resolutions all of which
passed in this chamber
um
the Senate Advanced House Bill 364 but
out of subcommittee but did not move it
to full committee which effectively
meant that it was dead and then they
tabled all of the individual resolutions
by tabling all the individual individual
resolutions unless Vehicles can be found
for those
those individuals that spent years and
years and years of their lives will not
get relief
even though we have the money in the
budget and we passed resolutions for
them so what we're trying to do with
this with Senate Bill 35 is to set up
the commission so that way if this is
adopted
by the senate or approved by the Senate
and then signed by the governor the
claimants with the resolutions that are
pending could file under this system
the Senate did make a couple of
suggestions and so in the interest of
not wanting the bill to come back to us
we incorporated those into the measure
and one of them was which I agreed with
was to change the dollar figures the
base was 50 000 they recommended raising
it to 60 000 the national average is
around 75 000 and then to change the top
end from 100 to 120 that will all be at
the discretion of the board so there
will be oversight but that's the major
change that I wanted to highlight to you
so I'd be happy to answer any questions
but certainly would appreciate your
favorable consideration and if it passes
today that would be the third time
that this measure passes which
interestingly to start where I finished
it took three times for the house to
pass the rape kit bill before we got it
through
third time's a charm we hope let's see
would you take a question yes Mr Speaker
representative Paris has a question
where is she representative Parish you
have a question your lights on
she waits you have no questions all
right thank you Mr Speaker
the gentleman has yielded the well we
appreciate your work on this important
bill
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair has
known the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to withdrawing
the committee's substitute the chair has
none The committee's Substitute is
withdrawn
is there any objection to adopting you
substitute offered by the committee on
rules
chair here's none the rules committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill the chair heals none
report the committee is agreed to shall
this bill now pass all in favor of the
passage of the bill we will vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
thank you
have all members voted
all members voted if so the clerk will
lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeased
are
137 the Nays 14. the bill hadn't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
go get them big boy
clerk will read the captions of SB 103
103.
set up a 103 by Senator Goodman of the
eighth and others to be entitled knocked
to a man Article 5 of chapter 12 of
title 44 the official go to Georgia
annotated relating the disposition of
unclaimed property so as to provide for
the handling of certain Wills this bill
having for the committee on Judiciary
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass by committee substitute
representative Vance Smith is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen we we passed this bill last
year it deals with dor and unclaimed
properties we have taxpayers citizens
that have probably had family that
passed away and they've had property
there it may be stocks or whatever it is
we're trying to help those people recoup
this unclaimed property and y'all were
nice enough last year to pass it out and
went to the Senate got on their calendar
and they never got to it at the end of
the year so we coming back this year SB
103 uh just to give you a couple of
numbers I average rate of return in
Georgia's 9 percent
the national average is 38 percent
Florida's average is 59 percent so we're
trying to raise that average and the way
we're going to try to do that we're
going to offer the individuals in our
state another option they can go through
the whole process themselves which is a
pretty interesting process or they can
go to a third party and they can
negotiate with those third-party people
a cost that cost is capped at 30 percent
so they can negotiate but they they can
help them
recoup this unclaimed property and
that's what's going on in the State of
Florida with that 59 percent so I'd
really ask for your favorable
consideration uh and let's get this
property back to the citizens if I'll
you if any questions Mr Speaker you have
a question all right representative
Wilkerson in to your left in the back
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes sir I guess I still have the
same concerns I had last year uh
currently
I cannot check for my spouse nor my kids
under Georgia law to see if there's any
unclaimed property has that been
addressed so I can go into search myself
but unless you have an interest in that
property you cannot check
have we addressed that you're going to
explain your question a little bit more
so under current law in Georgia we can
go to the website and pull up our name
on that website you type in your name
and see if you had any unclaimed
property I can do that for myself
however if I wanted to check my family
my my son my daughter my wife my brother
that is illegal under Georgia law so in
order to increase the ability to return
funds should we not
allow us to at least check for family
members
well that's a good point I I can't
address your answer I'm sorry I can't
give you an answer to that right there
but okay um but other than that I think
this will be a big benefit do you heal
for one more question yes sir
um under current law the fees I believe
on line 338 to 342 we kept it at 10 is
there a reason why on 380 to 384 we're
making it 30 that seems like a pretty
big jump from 10 to 30 percent as far as
the maximum amount of fees that can be
charged to return someone's legally
owned property well it's negotiable and
you don't you don't have to pay that fee
if you don't even have to use a third
party so that's that's strictly
negotiable by the individual and it was
in that it was the same amount as in the
bill last year that were passed
thank you Mr Speaker I appreciate your
favorable consideration and I'll yield
the will
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there an objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute the chair here
has done the committee's substitute is
adopted is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair here's none the
report the committee he has agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
for what purpose does representative
Parish rise

inquiry is it not true that some of
these members in here will get this and
