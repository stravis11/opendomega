The government oversight, there is a sign-up sheet down on the front if there's a
for public input is available.
We're going to use our handy-dandy mallet that we've been given by our rules chairman,
Gowel. Gowel. It's not a mallet. Okay. Okay. To call us the government oversight committee
in the session in order and we're getting started. There's more coming. Senator Sam would
you open us in a word of prayer and you are 14 and we'll get started. All right. Let's
I just pray.
Dear invite, we just thank you this day.
Thank you for all your mean blessings.
Just ask and pray that you be with us in this meeting.
Lead and guide us.
Be with our families while we're away.
And just watch over them in your name and pray.
Amen.
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
We started out with a short agenda.
It looks like SB337.
Senator Kirkpatrick.
And this apparently was done last year.
this is the new one, okay, this is new, okay, and I know you've got one more that you ask us to wait on,
but if you will come forth and give us a presentation of what we're dealing with, we will turn it over to you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I'm so happy all these people showed up to listen to my bill.
I don't think that's why they're here, actually.
Anyway, Senate Bill 337 has to do with the Georgia
Kernel Program.
Many of you may be familiar with the Kentucky
Kernel Program.
I'm actually from Kentucky and was honored to be
named a Kentucky Kernel in 1973.
And as I recall, this was related to my representation
of Kentucky in the National Spelling Bee.
This commission not only has a place of honor in my
office, which I brought it with you,
With me, so you could see it, but I also participated in the Honorable Order of Kentucky
Kernels, which is a charitable and social organization that has chapters around the country
and in other countries raising money for good causes.
Our current code has an aid to camp law, which our governor can use to appoint honorary
lieutenant kernels, but the appointments are only good for the term of the governor.
This bill creates a broader framework for creation of a more robust program that would
be a lifetime appointment and it does not create a program like Kentucky's with a 501C3
and all the trappings, although that could be done at a later time.
The bill requires that the selection is based on distinguished service to the state of Georgia.
That's in lines 15 and 16.
It does not require military service and actually the current code has a conflict because
in one spot it does relate to military service and in the other part it doesn't.
The other thing it does is it states that it's for the lifetime of the recipient rather
than the term of the governor which is lines 23 and 24 and I have discussed this with
the governor's office they don't have any concerns about it and again it just lays the
framework to make this a more honorific thing for people who provide distinguished service
to Georgia.
So I hope this is the easiest bill that you all deal with, this session.
You actually have a question, so that's how to, we want to make sure it's right.
Roberson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
is there a fiscal note associated with this at all or you're aware of one?
There is no fiscal consequence to that.
Okay. And you said, you know, how old would you have to be?
And just generally, you have to be an adult to be a Kentucky colonel.
You'd have to have lived long enough to provide the state,
to serve us to the state. So most of the time these would be adults.
Because I just noticed you were recognized by Kentucky when I was 11 years old.
So I was just trying to I was trying to make sure that because I'd always assumed that I was older than you so I know how old I am.
Yes, ma'am. So I was just trying to verify. I do appreciate it. Thank you, ma'am.
I'll just say I told us a governor bill when I looked at it upon the governor's personal. So I guess it's not governor bill.
So it's governors is okay with it, right?
Yes, the governor's office did not, I met with them about it.
They did not express any concerns.
One thing is we have a program right now called Lutin,
Lieutenant Colonel.
We've got an AIDD camp, Lieutenant Colonel program,
but I don't think anybody's ever heard of it.
And that would be one reason to do this,
to make it something that would be,
something people would like to have.
It's good to know that I didn't know about there either.
So I figured out maybe you had a little company try to
try to upgrade and make it a good promotion to make it a
full kernel, but you know, that's I'm okay with it, you
know? So maybe some day I can be, you know, I wanted to.
So we all can be, you know, thank you.
Thank you for the, I think he's asking if you'll consider
him for this next award coming up this next year.
if it passes.
All right, any other questions?
Senator Moore?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I don't have a question for the author,
but I would like to engage in some discussion before the vote.
If that's appropriate.
OK.
Yeah, I just, it's going to be no surprise to many,
but I'm going to be a hard no on this piece of legislation.
I think it's a bit embarrassing to the people of Northwest
Georgia when the first piece of legislation that we have come before government oversight
is granting the governor more power to do something.
And that's, you know, hand out political awards to his political friends.
Meanwhile, you know, we've got 19 people that have been indicted and they're the constitutional
rights are being violated and the governor hasn't done anything about it.
You know, our southern borders being invaded, people are being human trafficked.
You know, yesterday the news comes out that our election machines can be hacked with
a pen.
And this government oversight committee isn't doing anything to address any of those issues
that I think really needs them oversight.
But meanwhile, we have our first piece of legislation to give more power to a governor.
And I'm just extremely embarrassed and disappointed by that, Mr. Chairman.
So I'm going to be voting.
What does that respond to that?
Yes, ma'am.
Why would you do that?
The governor already has this ability,
but the commission only lasts for the term of the governor.
That's the only difference.
And when you're expanding into a greater amount,
it's getting the governor more.
Let's maintain your quality.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to ask a question.
What determines the criteria for getting this award?
this award. That is not stated here. Is that at the discretion of the governor, then
is my guess as far as that portion? Is that how I would understand this?
Yes, it would be at the discretion of whoever the sitting governor is at the time.
At the time. Okay. I just was, I didn't know if there was any outline of, you know,
what was there that I didn't say here. Okay.
No, sir, and I would hope that eventually we would use the wording change to be able to
create a non-profit to raise money for charity like Kentucky has done but
that is not entertained in this legislation. Could I also ask how you got
chosen to be an official Kentucky colonel? Was that based upon just the
opinion of someone or did you do specific things for that? As I said I think it
was related to representing Kentucky and the national spelling bee and so I
I think the idea of this is to honor accomplishments
and things that people do,
where they do something out of the ordinary.
So you were the participant in the spelling bay, correct?
Yes, sir.
What was your disc, did you go all the way to the end?
I'm just curious, what word was the last word?
I went to Washington DC and lost in the National Bee
Misspelled Award that I'd never heard of.
It was the word called Kalama, C-A-L-A-M-U-S.
That's how you spell it.
I didn't spell it that way.
I'm glad that you learned from that.
All right.
Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yeah.
Two R's.
Two T's.
Two R-C-T's.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
At the appropriate time, I like to close debate.
I mean, discussion.
And move, do pass.
This is the appropriate time for that,
and we will have a motion for,
do pass for LC, 46, 06, 81.
Is that correct bill number, I believe?
LC, 46, 06, 06, 84.
Okay.
Okay, any other discussions?
Second.
We got a second.
Any further discussion?
Just briefly.
Sorry.
First of all, I want to thank Madam Chair for bringing this bill forward.
I have a tremendous amount of respect for everybody on this committee and the work each of you do in your communities and the voters who support each of you, especially the chair.
And all of us know on this and this should not be something that I should have to do in public, but I will.
Each one of us knows how a bill gets passed in this chamber.
If any of us want a bill written to say a particular thing, then we do it.
We go sit with the attorneys and we write that legislation.
It goes through the process and it's assigned to a committee.
And then it is up to the chair of that committee to determine what the hearing is.
and while we may disagree on many things and my good friend from the North
he and I agree on many things. One thing that I think we all agree on is that
there's decorum and respect given to any senator or any citizen or any house
member who comes before these committees and I hope that we never lose
side of that and that we always show due respect to the chair of whatever
committee that we're sitting on representing in front of. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
All right, let's see we have a motion we have a socket. What is the pleasure of the committee?
All in favor raise your hand.
One, two, three, four, five, six, those opposed. We'll get out. Six, four, and one against.
And your bill moved forth. Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
and this committee is adjourned.
Are we good?
