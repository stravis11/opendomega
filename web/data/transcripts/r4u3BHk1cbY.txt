also
like to welcome all our constitutional
officers and their guests here. And now
to introduce our chief justice here and
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
honorable Nell SD Peterson, Chief
Justice Supreme Court of Georgia.
Justice Peterson was appointed to the
Supreme Court by Governor Nathan Deal in
2016 and assumed office as the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court on April 1,
2025. Prior to his time on the court, he
served in a variety of other roles in
Georgia state government, including as a
judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals,
general counsel to the University System
of Georgia, Georgia's first solicitor
general in the attorney general's
office, the executive counsel to the
governor. Before entering the state
government, he practiced law in Atlanta
and clerked for Chief Judge William H.
Prior Jr.
of United State Court of Appeals of the
11th Circuit. He is a proud graduate of
Kennesal State University and Harvard
Law School. He serves on numerous
government nonprofit boards and
committees and has received a variety of
honors and awards. He lives with his
wife and two children in Cobb County.
And it is my honor to present you today
the Justice of the Supreme Court, the
Honorable Nails Peterson.
Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker
Burns, President Prom Walker, Speaker
Prom Jones, members of the General
Assembly,
Presiding Justice Warren, and my fellow
justices, Chief Judge Brown and my
friends on the Court of Appeals, other
judges and fellow Georgians.
Every year, the governor reports on the
state of the state, and that report
always includes the announcement of
significant policy proposals and budget
priorities. The subjects of that speech
are critical to your work as
legislators.
This speech is different. Unlike the
governor, the courts have no formal role
in the legislative process.
Sometimes chief justices use this as a
time to brag on the good work of Georgia
courts or talk about promising judicial
branch policy initiatives. And I'll do
some of that because there's a lot of
great work to tell you about.
But today, I principally want to talk to
you about what the judicial system is
for and to remind us all of the role we
must each play to support and defend the
rule of law.
Central to the rule of law is the idea
that no person is above the law's
requirements or beneath its protections.
It's the idea that law applies equally
to everyone and the courts apply it
impartially and independently.
And today I can proudly report that the
state of Georgia's judiciary is strong
because Georgia's commitment to the rule
of law is strong.
The state of our judiciary will remain
strong only so long as we remain
committed to the rule of law. The rule
of law has always required defending.
And today is no exception. The judicial
oath calls Georgia judges to do equal
rights for the poor and the rich. In
other words, for the weak and the
powerful. Of course, the rule of law is
rarely tested when the powerful or the
popular win in court. Results that go
the other way can sometimes be a
different matter.
The rule of law has always been fragile
because by its very nature it requires
the strong and the rich to accept
results in favor of the weak and the
poor. It requires popular majorities of
all kinds to accept outcomes in favor of
small unpopular minority groups. It
requires the most powerful of all, the
government, to accept and obey limits on
government power.
This rule of law that we enjoy as
Americans has rarely happened throughout
human history. What we have had in this
country for 250 years, as imperfect as
it has been, especially here in the
South, is so rare. And yet, we often
take it for granted. If we are to
continue to enjoy the many blessings
that flow from the rule of law, we
cannot continue taking it for granted.
Each of us, all of us must do our part,
whatever that may be, to defend the rule
of law. A critical part is this. When
you hear about judicial decisions whose
outcomes you don't like, don't
reflexively question the court's
legitimacy. It's okay to disagree, even
to protest. But the rule of law will not
survive when the legitimacy of judicial
decisions and those who make them is
routinely questioned every time there's
an unpopular outcome.
And here I should add a word on what the
rule of law is not. The rule of law is
not rule by judges.
The law's constraints fall most strongly
on judges. If we push against those
constraints, we ourselves undermine the
rule of law. We must not stray out of
our limited scope of deciding the cases
before us according to the text of the
law that other people make.
Judges talk about the rule of law all
the time, but it's also critical for the
legislature.
Neither of our branches has the
authority or the ability to exercise
force. That function is reserved for the
executive. Instead, the work product of
both of our branches is just our words.
Judicial branch words come in a jury's
verdict or in a written judicial
opinion. We expect that these mere words
will control the outcome of criminal
prosecutions, decide which parent gets
custody of their child, resolve matters
with millions of dollars at stake, and
everything in between, one case at a
time.
Legislative words work a little
differently. One of you puts words on a
page, and after a lot of work, the rest
of you press red or green buttons. And
with enough green buttons, those words
reshape Georgia law for everyone.
The words on the pages of both branches,
although they operate differently, share
this in common. The rule of law is the
only thing that give any of our words
power. Without the rule of law, you are
all wasting your time and we judges and
robes are just playing a strange game of
dress up.
This state capital is a building for
policymaking and sometimes even
politics. Policymaking and politics are
team sports. But judges don't play for a
team. We wear robes, not jerseys.
Except, I suppose, for the occasional
Saturday in the fall.
But the rule of law depends on judges
following the law impartially and
independently.
One key opportunity you have this
session to strengthen healthy judicial
independence and impartiality
is by passing house resolution 251
sponsored by representative Kimberly
new. This constitutional amendment would
end the partisan election of probate
judges. Last year, you passed House Bill
426, also sponsored by Representative
New and by Senator Rick Williams, which
ended the partisan election of
magistrate judges. And we thank you for
that. Taking this final step with HR21
will ensure that all elected Georgia
judges are elected solely on a
nonpartisan basis.
Judges must be impartial and we must
also conduct ourselves in such a way as
to be perceived as impartial.
Requiring any of us to publicly and
formally align ourselves with a
political party can only undermine the
public's perception of the judiciary is
impartial.
I am grateful to former governors Roy
Barnes and Nathan Deal for recognizing
this truth and for jointly endorsing
this constitutional amendment.
Another important step that we are
grateful you took last year was
reforming Georgia's judicial
compensation system. Representative Rob
Leverett and Senator Bo Hatchet carried
House Bills 85 and 86, which modernized
an archaic and splintered system of
compensating Georgia's statewide and
superior court judges. And Chairman Matt
Hatchet and Chairman Blake Tillery
oversaw the funding of this system
consistent with the new model. We are
grateful to you all and we look forward
to this new model strengthening the
judiciary over time.
And what better way to transition from
judicial compensation than to talk about
how hard your courts are working. And we
are. Annually collected statewide trial
court data is not without limitations,
but I'd like to highlight case filing
increases in a few specific circuits
around the state. For example, in the
South Georgia circuit between Albenny
and the Florida border, case filings
increased nearly 44% between 2023 and
2024.
Ne just next door in Dicab cases have
increased 17% during the same time
period. And in the Chattahuchi Judicial
Circuit, which includes Columbus,
they've gone up 14%.
And we know that trial courts are
working hard across the state because
appellet court case loads have gone up
year-over-year. The Supreme Court's
direct appeal case load has gone up 25%.
The Court of Appeals direct appeal case
load in the same time period has gone up
24%.
Because trial courts have to decide a
case before an appellet court ever sees
it. Our appellet trend suggests that the
trial court's workload and output has
been trending upward over time.
Now, while deciding cases is the core
function of the judiciary, there's only
so much we can say about that. Judicial
ethics rules prohibit us from talking
about specific cases. So, our public
focus is often instead on judicial
policy initiatives. And I'm about to
shift my focus to some of those. But I
want to preface that shift with the
acknowledgement that our work deciding
cases is the critical work that courts
do. And all the policy stuff is
significant only to the extent that it
enables and improves our work of
deciding cases.
In recent years, we have worked to
improve the quality and reliability of
data related to juvenile courts and
foster care, an area of great importance
and interest to our branches. And I hope
you are seeing in the data that you
receive uh those results. Our court
improvement program in partnership with
the Department of Family and Children
Services is piloting a new model
intended to reduce the time from removal
to reunification for Georgia children in
foster care. This joint project is
operating in Cobb, Dicab, Fulton, and
Gwynette and we hope will provide
lessons and opportunities for expansion.
Additionally, the juvenile courts in
Athens, Clark, Gwynet, and Troop
counties are serving as pilot sites for
Georgia Thrive, Georgia's new infant
toddler court program. The product of
the work of many partners across the
health care, child welfare, legal, and
public policy communities. This
multi-year initiative seeks to address
the unique needs and opportunities
related to children from birth to age
three who find themselves in our
juvenile courts through obviously no
fault of their own.
We are grateful that legislators
regularly lend their time to our branch
on on initiatives like this in the
interest of helping improve the
administration of justice.
And with that service in mind, I want to
take this opportunity to publicly extend
the condolences of the judicial branch
on the passing of a remarkable woman who
committed her time to serving on our
court's committee on justice for
children and was a tireless voice for
young Georgians, Representative Mandy
Ballinger.
Her
life of service has left a legacy that
will echo for generations.
We have recently concluded two important
study committees in the judicial branch.
The first is the Judicial Council Ad Hoc
Committee on Artificial Intelligence in
the Courts, led by Justice Andrew
Pinson, Vice Chief Judge Elizabeth Goil,
and Superior Court Judge Steve Kelly. As
AI's power and reach continues to
advance rapidly, we all have to keep up,
and AI poses both risk and opportunity
for the judicial system. On the risk
side, the most publicized problems are
likely the least significant.
You may have heard stories about lawyers
filing briefs that are AI generated that
cite non-existent cases because the AI
tool invented them. That has happened
here in Georgia. It shouldn't and the
lawyers that have have done it expose
themselves to serious discipline under
existing rules. But the risk that kind
of misconduct poses the system is
relatively minimal as long as judges
read the cases that are cited in their
briefs. The more significant risks that
we know about anyway are things like
fabricated evidence. AI's capacity to
generate false recordings or images
presents a serious challenge to the
court systems historic approach to
authenticating evidence. We don't yet
have answers to these problems, but we
continue to work on them. AI may also
offer opportunities. As a reminder, a
core part of the rule of law is that no
one is beneath the law's protections,
but in 2023,
over 420,000
Georgia's civil cases involved at least
one party without a lawyer.
That's over one-third of the civil cases
in Georgia's superior state probate and
magistrate courts. And while Georgia's
constitution guarantees the right to
represent yourself in court, it's a safe
bet that most of those 420,000
unrepresented parties lacked a lawyer
because they couldn't afford one. And in
some counties, even if you can afford a
lawyer, there may not be one to hire.
54 Georgia counties have 10 or fewer
attorneys and eight counties, up from
seven last year, have no lawyers at all.
The rule of law cannot be available only
to those with access to lawyers. And as
AI tools,
I agree,
and as AI tools improve, it may be that
AI has a role to play in closing that
gap. But we're not waiting for AI to
solve this problem for us. The second
study committee that recently completed
its work is the Supreme Court study
committee on legal regulatory reform led
by Justice Carlo Wong McMillan and
presiding Judge Steve Dillard. It's easy
to look at the problem of unrepresented
litigants and decide that the government
should just throw money at it. That is
not what this committee did.
The Georgia Constitution vests the
exclusive authority for regulating the
practice of law in the Supreme Court and
we do that through the state bar, an arm
of the court. This committee studied our
regulation of the practice of law to
determine whether restrictions and
limitations
on that we have imposed on non-awyers
assisting with legal issues might be
making this problem worse.
The committee recommended that the court
consider a pilot project in which we
permit trained non- lawyers to perform
certain limited legal tasks.
Other states have been experimenting
with similar models and we have the
opportunity to use what worked for them
and to avoid what didn't. As we evaluate
this recommendation, I am hopeful that
our creativity in lifting regulatory
limitations may be a useful tool in
closing the justice gap and ensuring
that no Georgian is beneath the law's
protections.
And just as the rule of law requires
that all people enjoy the law's
protections, it also requires that we
protect judges from those who would do
them harm because of their rulings.
Threats against judges have received
national attention the last several
years. Just a couple weeks ago, an
Indiana judge and his wife were shot
through their front door by a criminal
defendant with a pending case in front
of him. And the US Marshall Service
reports more than 560 threats against
federal judges during FY2025 alone.
Georgia, on the other hand, has never
had a process for tracking threats
against Georgia judges comprehensively,
thanks to the great work of the Judicial
Council Standing Committee on Security,
led by Justice Shan Ellen Lrua and
presiding Judge Brian Rickman and
supported by strategic investments that
you have made. We are working toward
such a process. And even with the
existing limitations, we have already
tracked 35 threats against 30 justices
and judges since late 2024,
resulting in nine arrests.
This year, we will look to build on the
progress that we have already made. As I
mentioned in greater detail several
weeks ago to the joint appropriations
committees, the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals budget requests seek a
modest increase for funding for a joint
effort to enhance judicial security that
if funded will pay dividends across the
state. I thank each of you for the
support that you have given us in
improving judicial security and I ask
that you continue to make it a priority
given all of these challenges. Why do
Georgia judges persist in the hard work
of making the rule of law real for
Georgians? I think the answer is the
same answer for you members of the
general assembly. You too face threats
to your security. You too face all sorts
of challenges in your community through
your service.
Both judges and legislators face a lot
of the same challenges. We are all in
this together.
And we all face those challenges headon
because we care about our communities.
We care about the people we serve. We
care about doing the right thing. And
above all, we are committed to
fulfilling our oaths.
Your oath is a bit different from our
oath because our roles are different.
The judicial oath promises independence
and impartiality.
In contrast, the legislative oath
promises the exercise of judgment in the
service of the interests and prosperity
of the state. But despite these
differences, both the legislative and
judicial oaths are rooted in the promise
to uphold the Constitution of the State
of Georgia and the Constitution of the
United States. When we take these oaths,
we make a promise to our communities. We
make a promise to those who elected us.
We make a promise to our families. And
for many of us, we also make a promise
to God.
This aspect of the oath as a promise to
God has shaped the history of our legal
system. In fact, in colonial England and
for most of our history as a state,
criminal defendants were prohibited from
testifying under oath, lest in their
desire for a quiddle, they brought upon
themselves divine judgment. Georgia was
the last state in the union to change
that rule. We didn't change it until
1962.
In the Catholic tradition, St. Thomas
Moore is the patron saint of lawyers.
But he wasn't just a lawyer. He also
served as speaker of the House of
Commons
and then Lord Chancellor of England
under Henry VIII. He's a great example
of both judges and legislators to
emulate. He ultimately gave his life to
avoid breaking his oath. His commitment
to keep that promise to God is reflected
no matter the cost is reflected in his
last words which characterized himself
as the king's good servant and God's
first. That's pretty good. But of
course, as we like to remind our British
friends every July 4th and especially
during this 250th anniversary of
American independence here in the United
States, we don't have a king. as the
constitution makes clear here, the
people are sovereign.
And so as
And so as you return to your legislative
business and we return to our judicial
business, let us all commit to keep our
oses to the Constitution and the rule of
law it embodies. If we do, we will truly
be the people's good servants as we seek
to be God's first. Thank you. May God
bless each of you, our great state of
Georgia, and the United States of
America.
Thank you, Jess Peterson.
Thoroughly enjoyed that. We greatly
appreciate that and we greatly
appreciate all the judiciary members
here. Uh and thank you all for your
service and dedication to the state of
Georgia.
Mr. Mr. Doorkeeper,
please escort the Chief Justice of the
Justice Supreme Court and the judges of
the Court of Appeals for the Chamber at
this time.
