Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 13th House District, Chairman Katie Dempsey, Chairman Dempsey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good morning. I'm humbled to bring to you today a great friend. Reverend Jody Haggardy has served as senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in Rome since 2008. He has a true passion for redefining the way church is done. And under his leadership, Cornerstone has grown its strategic initiatives for impacting lives not only throughout Floyd County, but around the world. His world view was first challenged on mission to Columbia. This new perspective expanded his compassion for all people and energized his vision to make the gospel accessible to everyone, everywhere. Based on the inspiration of his experience in Columbia, Reverend Haggardy brought a Spanish-speaking Colombian pastor to Rome and established the Cornerstone and Espennial congregation. And that same year, he led Cornerstone to create partnerships in remote Guatemala and multiple countries in Southeast Asia. And the year since Cornerstone has expanded its international influence to include South Sudan and Haiti addressing all kinds of concerns, improving hygiene, increasing access to education, insect trafficking, and above all, communicate the love of Christ and indigenous languages and cultures. Over the last four years, where the growing international footprint, Reverend Haggardy began to work with more than 20 local pastors to develop strategies for addressing the social ills and increasing needs of vulnerable populations in Rome and Floyd County, just like us establishing that relationship before the need arises. Their joint efforts grew into the churches of Rome, a collaborative effort of congregations crossing lines of denomination and ethnicity to meet the needs of all people in the name of Christ. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, they have been significantly involved in providing services, including essential workers and healthcare professionals. But in the most recent weeks, along with the African American pastors, the churches of Rome have been afforded a unique platform and opportunity to leverage their collaborative relationships to promote unity, peace, and edifying dialogue in Rome. Most recently hosting a public forum to lead discussions on the impact of race in Rome, to establish ongoing dialogue with local pastors and their senior leadership of the local police department. Reverend Haggardy and his wife, Haley, have three beautiful daughters, Ava 14 Julia Kate and Piper 5. His love of those children mirrors everything that he hopes for each and every one of us and for our great state. He is a true friend and I hope that you'll be blessed by his message this morning. Thank you, Jody. Thank you, Representative Dempsey. For the invite and thank you to everyone else in this great room today. For allowing me to share a few minutes with you. Before you begin your day, I don't have a sermon for you this morning. I don't have a lot of scripture reading. I just want to share a lesson with you that my 14-year-old just taught me and I pray that it helps. First of all, this is not my first time here. I don't know if you ever think about this, but inspiration of a child. I came here as a fifth grader on a school bus from Rome, Georgia. Got to sit in one of your seats. Not sure which one it is now, but I just remember getting to vote for something that they, all our members miss Wilson telling me, well, she was telling the whole class, but she pointed at me specifically to say, don't you dare write your name in those desks. So I want to make something very clear to you this morning before I go any further. If you see any names in those desks, I didn't do it. I promise you it wasn't me, okay? Just want to make that clear. But I'm so inspired as a child when I first came here and I sat in this room. I sat in one of your desks. And this is what I thought as a fifth grader. There are important people in this room. I mean, wow. I looked across to my left and I thought I bet Abraham Lincoln sat right there. George Washington maybe sat in my seat. I mean, I was so inspired, important people sit in this room. I miss Wilson helped me with my civics and my American history later, but I was right about one thing, important people do sit in this room. And if you haven't been told lately, you're important to us. I don't care what political party you're with. We pray for you. I pray for you that you have wisdom. I know you have difficult things to decide this week. And I know there's a lot on you. Our state is hurting. Our cities are hurting. Our communities are hurting. But we are praying for you. You are valuable to us and we appreciate your service. As long as sharing with my older daughter that I would be speaking here today, she was sharing with me about an opportunity that she had come to her door. She actually text me this and this is how she text me so I can get it right. Dad, did you get my DM from IG about DW? I said, baby, what is that mean? Did you get my direct message from Instagram about Disney World? Oh, thank you. No, I got it, but I didn't understand that. So what about that? What are you going to talk about that? What did you get it? And I read it. She had an invite to possibly try out as either a model or an extra on the show or something like that. And I didn't know if it was real or fake or I did check it out. She said, what do you think should I do it? And I said, baby, if that's in your heart, go ahead. I'll help you with it. Then she began to say to me, but dad, I'm nervous. What if they don't like me? I said, baby, I'm going to speak before the house in Georgia. I'm nervous, dude. What if they don't like me? That's a possibility. But you got to try anyway if it's in your heart. She said, but dad, what if I do it? And they say yes. I don't want to be like some of those other people that have been on TV if they make bad decisions when they get money or fame. And what if they like me and they put me on something and what if I change? To which I replied to her this, baby. Money, power, and fame do not change you. They only reveal what's in your heart. Whatever's in your heart is only amplified by money, power, and fame. And at this point, I thought it was being a great dad. You know, I was teaching her a lesson, but this is what she taught me next. She said, Dad, so you think I should do this then? I said, sure. I said, I'll make the call. Let me make sure it's legitimate first, you know. And she said, okay. Sounds great, Dad. But hey, before you call them, she's got the parking lot of our church. She's about to get out. She says, opens the door and says, before you call them, I want to check my heart first. It's coming from a 14-year-old. And I thought to myself, how often lately have I checked my heart? You don't have to be a person of faith to do this. To the individual at the Starbucks store, I got my order wrong. Did I check my heart at it as reply out of frustration because I didn't get the right syrup? To my employees who work for me and make me look really good, have I checked my heart with them lately? To the people that disagree with me, have I checked my heart with them today? We're never going to see 100 percent. No one's ever going to agree 100 percent with us. But I thought about my daughter and the last thing I would say with you today is this, we teach our children this from the time they're very little. We teach them the golden rule, which Jesus taught, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And so this morning, imagine what would happen if all of us, regardless of our faith, just simply did what a child taught me to do. And let's just check my heart today. Would you allow me to pray for you this morning? Dear Jesus, I thank you so much for this body. I thank you, Lord, for the governing body in this room. I thank you, God, and I don't count it as any small privilege to be here to pray for them. Father, I'm asking you that you would bring wisdom in this house. Guidance for decisions that have to be made. Lord, the pressure that is there, we all know it's present. But I pray that you would bring peace in this room, peace in every meeting that goes forth. Wisdom for every decision and understanding for every conflict. But God, most of all, I ask you to help us each check our heart today. As we try to follow you more, and we try to listen to you greatly. It's in Jesus' name we pray and give you thanks. Amen. Amen. Our pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits read the proceedings of the previous legislative days and found them to be correct. And Father, funny about getting older, your eyesight may weaken, but yet you can see through people much better. How true. Mr. Chairman, can you update us one day this week on the removal of the golden ray from the sound down there? I've been getting pictures from some amateur photographer. And it looks like that project is moving into a great phase. Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.

Good morning, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. So the last time I was before you, I shared some statistics from the CDC regarding our children. That number across the nation was 87,806. As of Sunday, the number is now 99,618 across the nation, which is an increase of 11,812. In Georgia, the Georgia Department of Public Health, I believe it was last Thursday, I came before you. The cases were 2859. As of Sunday, the cases stand at 3,252 cases, which is an increase of 393 of our children in Georgia. Those under the age of 1 is 153.

Those 1 to 4, 475, those 5 to 9, 648, those 10 to 17, 1,976. These are not fictitious numbers for just fictitious children. These are our children, our grandchildren, our nieces, our nephews, our sons and our daughters. We have to right now have this conversation and make a plan to keep our children safe, especially because we have superintendents, we have directors of daycares, and we have sports that are going to resume. We have to make a plan to keep our children safe. And I just want to remind you that in Long County, they have to cancel the conditioning and interaction because a child contracted COVID-19. And on another note, I just want you to know at ages 18 to 29, that group is at 11,568. They have surpassed all other groups that we were concerned about. Please let's have the conversation and get a plan. Thank you so much and I yield the well. Representative Hutchinson is recognized for a morning order. Representative Hutchinson. I do not see her. We are now going on to the rules calendar. We are going to be at ease for just a moment or two while the clerk's office finishes preparations for the rules calendar. Okay, we'll come back to order. What purpose does the minority leader of the House rise? Mr. Speaker, to make a motion. State your motion. A move to take from the table House Bill 1167. Gentlemen, is move that House Bill 1167 be removed from the table? The clerk will read the caption. House Bill 1167 by the motion of Canada, 59th, AM, Thomas of the 56th, Garden of the 57th and others, being a title of an act to provide for a new homestead exemption from City, Atlanta, Admiral Orham taxes. On the gentleman's motion at House Bill 1167 be removed from the table. Is there any objection? Hearing none, it is so ordered and that bill will go on the next local calendar. All right, now we're going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 313. Senate Bill 313 by Senator Berkley, 11th, Watson of the 1st, Duke, and 30th, Kennedy of the 18th, upstead, 50th, and others, being a title of an act to amend chapter 64 of Title 33, the fiscal to George Annotator relating to regulation and licensure pharmacy benefit managers. This bill ever been referred to the committee on the special committee on quality health care. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman David Knight to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To my colleagues, I want to first begin by saying thank you. For many years now, this state through the leadership of the legislature has been aggressively dealing with, one of the, I believe, the nation's largest problems dealing with health care. And that is the excessive price of prescription drugs, and also, quite frankly, the practices of these large companies in which they hide behind proprietary and confidential information in scrupulous practices. You have helped over a number of years lead the way from a state's perspective as we address this. Last year, I'll remind you that we passed House Bill 233 and House Bill 323. First in the nation, anti-steering legislation, 323 dealt with it from the insurance side, but more so, House Bill 233, which was very, very important, dealt with it from the regulation of the pharmacy side. We weren't getting at pBMs, we were getting at pharmacies affiliated with those pBMs. This year, this House has passed four pieces of legislation that again deal with this and update our position that we are going to deal with this heinous practices that we see in this industry, the high price of prescription drugs. And we have been very successful. Senate Bill 313, I'm happy you're reading for them, is a bill in which passed out of our House as a committee substitute that is going to mirror House Bill 946, this body passed, and it passed out of the Senate last week. And you're going to have two bills that are identical bills, and they're going to be the toughest. This bill will be one of the toughest measures in the nation against pBMs. In this legislature, they're all the hard work we've done, have had a cooperative spirit between the House and the Senate. And it is on the calendar in the Senate today. So briefly, I don't want to rehash what 946 did, but again, I want to let you know that Senate Bill 313 and House Bill 946, as you see it, and as the changes I'm about to explain to you, when they pass out, we're going to have two identical bills. So let me tell you what the changes are that you're going to see as these bills come through and they'll be the same. First of all, before I get to that, I want to let you know that we have had an exhaustive process, and I want to think Chairman Newton and others who have absolutely put their heart and soul in this. Chairman Cooper, Chairman Hatchett and others, I know I'm missing some, that have put their heart and soul into this issue. And we also, I want to let you know, have made sure that we have had an open process, many hearings. And the changes that you will see today were a result of meeting with not only DCH, but the Governor's Office, to come up with these changes so that we have, I think, the best piece of legislation going forward. So I want to do that. I want to make sure that we go over those changes. So the change Section 3 of Senate Bill 313 simply removes a requirement that the former prior authorization committees have a license physician. We came at this very hard. We heard that that would be unrealistic to the cost. So what we've done is we've kept in the provision regarding the appeals process that says if you're a doctor with a PVM, you have to have on that a physician working on PVM involved with the physician of the same practice on that appeal. So if you're orthopedic surgeon, you don't need to be talking to a pediatrician. And so we're moving this forward. And we've also included language that instructs DCH as they enter in these contracts to make sure that they try to include Georgia license physicians in future contracts and amendments with these PVMs. Section 4, there was concern regarding the responsibility for Medicaid and state health benefit audits. We simply made sure that DCH clarified that DCH has the authority under the substitute. Section 5, there was concern from industry in regarding the confidentiality of the methodologies. And we said as long and we clarified language as long as the confidentiality standards of Georgia law are met, that the methodologies submitted to the Commissioner stay confidential. We also had, I think the heart of the bill was a reporting process that for the first time gets it transparency. We have moved that from every three months to four months and we had concerns from some folks out there and we've carved out the 340 B claims out of this. And that was also in discussion with DCH. And we've also heard the concerns of the cost to the state. So we've now changed those revisions to put the onus back on the PVMs to publish this information. And you know, online and submit that to the Commissioner. Section 6, remove the requirements and we had very, very honest requirements that PVMs passed back 100% of rebates and discounts. And what we did listening to industry, we said you got to offer those in all your plans. And no longer can they hide behind that, they're going to have to offer an option in those plans that up what 100% rebate would look like. So we also added in our prohibition on spread pricing. And if you remember, we had concerns and a lot of people about the commercial, this is going to cost more. So we basically said that there would be an exception for the requirement on non spread pricing. They have to offer all for the options on a plan for non spread pricing in the commercial sector. However, as we've seen this through the reports of this general symbol, we've seen that the state help, I mean the managed care, have been charging spread for the pricing to the state for years and a ton of tens of millions of dollars. And so we've kept that provision in as regards to governmental plans. We've also heard the concerns from DCH. We have modified the copay such that we've added in our provision about generic drugs. We've told you for the first time I've addressed this and we've told the PBMs that if you accept a copay or a payment on behalf of the beneficiary that you will apply it across the board to deductibles or copays across the board. And beforehand, they were accepting some of this, but they did not apply it to the members, copay or deductible. Section 7, we had a morals clause that required PBMs contract with the state to adhere to all Georgia laws across the market channels. We've backed out and compromised on that. And then section 8, in regard to state auditor's roles, we made revisions that were not material that better reflect, make sure that they're clear on the audit provisions going forward SB 313. So that, again, I want to reiterate, we passed this today's SB 13 and the Senate passes the substitute that was passed over there in the Senate committee. We will have identical bills, 313 and 946 will be identical bills and it will be the toughest PBM legislation in the nation. And hopefully with that, we can bring transparency, finally bring some transparency to drug pricing. And we can make sure that we continue to give choice to our patients in Georgia, to the beneficiaries in Georgia. With that, Mr. Speaker, I will stand for any questions. Chair, do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman yield. Yes, to the leader I do. Mr. Chairman, I really don't have a question, to be honest with you, but you recognize a lot of folks. They're a big part of moving this legislation over a long period of time and taking all voices and consideration. But you left yourself out. We appreciate your passion for this issue and your passion for doing the right thing for the people of Georgia. Thank you and I look forward to support it and encourage all the members to support this bill. Thank you, leader Burns. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, if there's no other questions, I'm going to yield the well and I'll ask for this. Chambers continued support for this bill as we try to address the healthcare crisis that we see in this state in this country. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The Chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 313? Will vote yes, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll.

The official go to George annotated relating to the juvenile code. So it's a provider who enhanced notice to an improved participation of Foster, pre-adoptive, and relative caregivers in certain hearings. This bill I refer to the committee on juvenile justice. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Weighdower to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring before you Senate Bill 439. We've done a lot of things in legislature over the last several years to ensure that foster care children and judges that have to make decisions on the well-being of those children get the information they need so they can make the best decision for the interest of that child. And that's exactly what this bill does. It takes it a step further. It ensures that foster care parents are contacted appropriately in writing. It's a key element so that the judge has those findings at their disposal so that they know where exactly that foster parent stands in this matter. It provides for those judges having access to those findings to give them the best opportunity to do the best thing for the child as they decide their placement and what happens with that child. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. You do not appear. We do have a question. Will person prints? Chair recognizes representative prints up in the gallery to your left. Does Jim and you I do. Is it not true that foster parents adopted parents and parents that we're addressing in this legislation provide some type of ring of care for most of these kids that have basically lost their parents due to some unfortunate circumstance? The gentleman definitely knows what he speaks. Thank you. Does Jim and first of all brother you. I do. And plus that ring of care could also turn into the ring of necessity. These young people then go to the ring of duty. That's become very productive citizens in the United States. I would think that the gentleman is definitely caught up on some reading. Thank you sir. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 249. Senate Bill 249. Senate Bill 249. Senator Alvers, the 56th Harper, the 7th and Robertson of the 29th to be entitled an act to amend chapter 17 to title 47, the official court of Georgia annotated relating to the peace, officers annuity and benefit fund. This bill haven't referred to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Senate Bill 249 was postponed from the previous legislative day until the next legislative day. When it was before the rules committee was approved to move forward, it was assigned a one hour debate limit. That does not include the initial presentation by the author or the chairman's time if any. Chair recognizes representative gravely to present the bill. Let's have a little order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I bring to you a much needed provision in our state. Senate Bill 249 has been worked on for the past 25 years. The bill simply does this. It adds jail officers to the list of eligible persons for the peace officers annuity benefit program. Friends, I want to tell you something. Across this state and communities, in rural communities, communities both large and small, you have men and women who day in and day out on every shift do not leave the jailhouse. These are not road officers, these are not road deputies. These are not even what you would consider top tier brass personnel. These are individuals day in and day out who have upfront and personal interaction with inmates. And they are not eligible to participate in the retirement program called the police officer's annuity benefit. Now, this bill also does this. It increases the monthly contribution that members, those law enforcement personnel across the board that are involved in this particular program. It increases their monthly contribution from 20 to $25. It has a cap up to $50. So if that contribution needs to increase, it can be increased up to $50 that the individuals that are members of this program will have to contribute monthly. It revises the current tier system that we have in determining fines or slash fees for base fines and criminal acts, for quasi criminal acts. It goes from a tier system, it goes to a flat fee system or a flat fine system for pre-trial $5 or 5% of the base fine at conviction $10 or 10% of the base crime, whichever is higher. Now, friends, I also want to say this. This bill or a vote yes for this bill not only funds the police officer annuity benefit. I want to tell you what else these fines, the percentages that the individual would pay. I want to tell you what else it funds. The Brain and Spinal Injury Trust Fund. Peace Officer, Prosecutor and Indigent Defense Fund A and B. Local Vist Victim Assistance Program. The County Law Library. State Crime Victims Emergency Fund. Drug Abuse Treatment and Education Fund. The Safe Harbor for Sexually Exploited Children's Fund. Part of the fines go into the state general fund specifically for the crime lab. It also does Indigent Defense Application fee. So friends, just a couple of months ago, this measure passed the state senate unanimously. Both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives voted unanimously to add jailers into this fund and to move from a tear fee structure to a flat fee rate of $5 again or 5% of the base fine $10 or 10% of the base fine. That's what this bill does, ladies and gentlemen. It simply allows those since 1950 who have not allowed to be a part of this program for 70 years. This program has been available, but they've been analogable to be able to be a part of it. This bill allows them to be a part of it and they will pay their contribution into a monthly basis for this program. Mr. Speaker, I would ask for favorable consideration. I know there may be something that I want to speak on the bill, but I would ask for your yes vote on SB 249. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair, recognizes representative McLauren to your left up in the gallery for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will gentlemen yield? Yes. Is it not true, sir, that Georgia Constitution Article 1, Section 1 paragraph 24 reads that no person shall be compelled to pay costs in any criminal case except after conviction on final trial. I believe it's the individuals reading that I believe he believes what he states. Will gentlemen yield for one more question? I will. Thank you. Is it not true that in referring to an additional supplemental cost on top of a pre-trial version programs cost that is calculated as a base or as a percentage on that cost as a base which you referred to as a fine. Is it not true that that additional percentage fine is in violation of that constitutional provision? I don't know if that's true, no, sir. Okay, that's all good. Thank you. Thank you. I do not think you have any other questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will yield the way. Gentlemen is yielded the well. Is there any object? I'm sorry. We have others that have signed up to speak. Chair recognizes Representative Wilkerson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I come down to speak in opposition to Senate Bill 249. I don't do this lightly. I believe that we all want to see our officers and jailers get the retirement that they deserve. The question is how do we pay for that? When you get a simple traffic ticket you should not fund this whole state government whether retirement for police officers or whether it's all the laundry list of items that the representative had read already. So it's not a question of whether we wanted or not. It's a question of whether now is the time to be adding additional fines. The pre-trial diversion program is very successful in Cobb County. We're going to go from charging $5 to 5%. That's a pretty big job. So I'm down here today and I've spoken to some officers and they understand that. Once you say that the perception will be that we're in a tight budget squeeze and that we're going to encourage officers to go out and give tickets. So when someone gets pulled over, they're getting pulled over because they have a frame on their license plate like many of us have and that's why they're getting the ticket with additional fines or they're getting a fine because they got to make payroll and make retirement. We are creating tension where there doesn't need to be any tension by adding all these fines on every charge. Punish people for the crime they commit but don't subsidize government. So that's the only reason that I'm down here is to basically say that we need to find out what we need to do the right way and get out of fines and just look at the budget, put our priorities in place and if police officers are our priority which I believe they are then we need to pay for it appropriately and I'll just yield for any questions. You have a question if you care to yield. I do. Chair recognizes representative Vernon Jones. He waves. Okay. I do not think you have any other questions. Thank you and I ask that you vote in opposition and then we come back next year and fund this properly. Thank you. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House leader, Tramble, to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. You know section one and section two, a fully support. But the crux of the problem with the bill is section three, how we fund it and this point has been made and I won't belabor that point but what I do want to tell you is who funds it. So the funding in section three is paid by every defendant in superior court, state court, juvenile court, probate court, magistrate court and municipal court. So I want everybody to make sure that they understand when they pass this that anybody who passes through that whether it be a local code ordinance violation all the way up to a felony defendant in superior court has the potential to be impacted by this legislation. The fiscal note itself says that the revenue on fines would double if we pass this and just for misdemeanors, let's just talk about misdemeanors for one second about what it means in real out of pocket cost. Under Georgia law, a misdemeanor carries a fine up to a thousand dollars. So if you're fine up to the fullest extent of the law for a misdemeanor, this bill means you pay an additional fifty dollars over what you pay today. Now that doesn't even include the problem with pretrial diversion where today you would just pay a flat five dollars for the amount and pretrial diversion works like this if you're not familiar with it or don't know someone who's ever been through that process. They don't you don't plead to the case. So there's no adjudication of guilt associated with pretrial diversion. You go in and if you don't offend for a period of time and you agree to make a payment to pretrial diversion, then you go about your business and the offense whether it be a ticket or a charge is it goes away. So today in those range from anywhere from from practitioners from a quick survey of that to a couple of hundred dollars up to a thousand dollars. So we're moving that from five dollars to five percent with no adjudication of guilt. It's a questionable constitutionality. The way it got into the law was five dollars wasn't enough for people to file suit about. But five percent is different and the constitutional the constitutional infirmity is the same. One other point about this and then and then I'll take my seat. You know we like to think that when we're passing this bill that it's just we're attacking something on to a fine that's already going to get paid. But you know what when you were charged whether it be a traffic ticket whether it be a criminal charge in state court or whether it be a local ordinance violation where you got a you rent you're running a file of a building inspector in your county or some other issue you you get summoned to court summon to court and that means that the full weight of the government in all its power says that you have to wait all other business aside to attend that day. So it means that you have to take time off of work. Time away from any family obligation anything you've got to show up and be there in court that day to resolve that issue. So before we think well this is just a little a little something that we'll put on the backs of violators we need to think about the process as well because this is a welcome to court tax. That's what it is we can call it a fee but it's a tax. It's a tax of having to show up and defend your constitutional liberty if you plead guilty or even if you take a route where you're not really in that much trouble and you're working something out and going through pretrial diversion we're seeking to levy.

attacks on citizens trying to get on with their lives. And it falls most heavily on the backs of those who can least afford to pay it in the first place. And what winds up with that? So if you can't pay the full fine, a lot of times judges, if you've got a checkbook and you can write the fine, they'll let you go on non-reporting probation, which means you don't have to check in with your probation officer. You don't have that form of onerous, supervised control of the government over your life for a period of time. And the addition of $50 may mean that you have that reporting obligation for a longer period of time than you otherwise would. I'm all for funding this retirement. But surely we can do it in a fairer, more just way. Mr. Speaker, I yield well. Gentlemen has yielded the well. That is all the speakers. Thank you. Are you wanting to do the chairman's time? Or... Okay, we're not to that point yet. Chair recognizes... Chair recognizes the chair of the Retirement Committee, Chairman Benton, for the chairman's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, or the reminder of my time to the presenter of the bill. Thank you. Gentlemen has that right, Chair recognizes representative gravely for the balance of the chair's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, I will simply remind you, this is how we do, with this how we fund the program in current law today. There's nothing unconstitutional about that. That's how we do it today. That's how we've always done it. Matter of fact, the Senate across the hall recognized that there wasn't any arguments of unconstitutionality. Republicans and Democrats voted this unanimously. Yet two months later, there seems to be a constitutional conflict. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that you simply vote your conscience on this bill, to add jailers to the POAB program. They need to be eligible. They are members of law enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, I yielded the well. For what purpose does representative Sains rise? State your inquiry. Is it not true that in Georgia, we were titled one of the worst states to be a law enforcement officer in 2019? And furthermore, is it not true to invest in it, to have a professional law enforcement force with integrity, we first must invest in a professional force. And a necessary component of that is to have an adequate benefits and compensation package throughout this state. And this bill does so. If the gentleman says states, I know he believes that to be true. What purpose does representative Vernon Jones rise? Paul Meijing, your inquiry. But is it true that I have the honor of managing a very large police department in state of Georgia? I think I recall that you did, yes. Isn't it further true that Mr. Speaker that those jellers who work at the jail, the local jails, they have one of the most dangerous jobs there is in law enforcement? If the gentleman says states, and is it further true that they don't have a lot of the benefits or some of the important benefits that some of the other law enforcement officers have? And they too, although I agree with your previous speaker about the fines and the amount, but isn't it true that they deserve to be protected as well so they can take their families? And we not lose those very important training experience local law enforcement officers who work in the jail each and every day putting their lives on the line too. If the gentleman says states, I know he believes that to be true. What purpose does representative McLaura rise? Probably not very accurate. State your inquiry. Isn't not true that if I were worried about the constitutionality of something, the group I'd put last on speed dial is the Senate. Oh, there's so much I'd like to say. You're even smarter than I thought you were a representative. What purpose does the majority leader of the House rise? I wanted to second that motion, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. We. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that my home county, if in him County, had one of the first victims witness programs in this state as it was implemented there of former Senator and my dear friend, Senator Jack Hill? I think I recall hearing that at one time. And further, probably inquirements, state your inquiry. And isn't it further true that part of the funds, that cut part of the money that comes from this fund, these assessments goes to the victims witness program, that the perpetrators have a hand in helping the folks that they have committed crimes against and help the victims of crime put their lives back in order and give some semblance of release to them as well. I know the gentleman believes that to be true and that he knows what he speaks about. What purpose does representative Bowdie rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't that true that if five percent or greater five dollar could have been an innocent defendant who are trying to pay these funds and trying to pay their pre-trial divergent progress when they don't have the funds already to pay those funds or fees? I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All right, one final parliamentary inquiry and we're going to vote. What purpose does representative Bennett rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't that true that I for hire and support the police officers and jail workers in the state of Georgia? If the lady so states. Further parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't that true that I believe that police and fines on the most vulnerable citizens just create more problems for those who defies on hold the fines? If the lady states that that to be her concern on take her at her word. Okay, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

Senate Bill 26 by Senator Ligon of the third in black of the eighth to be entitled to an act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 2, Title 47, the official code of Georgia and Attainee will lead in the service credible towards retirement benefits under the Employees Retirement System of Georgia. This bill haven't referred to the Committee on Retirement, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Noel Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues. I rise today bringing a bill before you from Senator Ligon and Ellis Black on the Employee Retirement System of Georgia for part time people or temporary employees that become full time in our state program. First of all, this bill would amend provisions relating to credible service for members of the Employee Retirement System of Georgia. Specifically, it would allow members to obtain credible service per prior service covered under the Georgia Defined Contribution Plan. Number one, the members must accrue at least five years of membership service in the Employee Retirement System of Georgia. Number two, they must apply to the Board of Trustees. Number three, they must provide proof of such prior service as a Georgia Defined Contribution Member. Number four must authorize the transfer of all funds from his or her Georgia Defined Contribution Plan account. And number five, it must be actuarially sound. Must pay to the Board of Trustees an amount determined to be sufficient to cover the full actuarial calls of granting such service after a court counting for any transfer of funds from the Georgia Defined Contribution Plan. This plan has been researched and it is actuarially sound. The bill authorizes the member to make a one-time payment coming from the full amount established by the board within 90 days when they come from another employer. And they can deduct, make a one-time payment or they can pay it over 120 months in the state would do a payroll deduction method on if that's what they chose. But we would appreciate your favorable vote on this bill, Senate Bill 26. And thank you for your time, Mr. Speaker. Are you yield for any questions? Do you have a question? No, sir. I don't. Do you find my throat? Chairman Knight? I didn't understand that sign language. OK. I do not think you have any questions. I yield the will. He's yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's not in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 26 will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll.

Senate Bill 294, Senator Black, the eighth upstate letter of the 52nd and others to be entitled an act to amend Code Section 47, 20, 80, 70, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the eligible large retirement systems authorized to invest in certain alternative investments, this bill have referred to the committee on retirement, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Bonny Rich to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues this afternoon, I bring to you Senate Bill 294. Current law allows our state large retirement plans to invest up to 5% in alternative investments. Alternative investments include investments such as real estate and private equities. Senate Bill 294 will allow the teacher retirement system this same ability, subject of course to the final decision of the TRS Board of Trustees. This is a permissive bill, it allows them the ability to invest up to 5% in alternative investments, it does not require it. We have, I have heard from the largest school system in the state, the Gwinnett County school system, they are in support of this bill. Page in the Georgia retired educators, they testified in the retirement committee where we sat, where I sat and heard this bill and they are not opposing Senate Bill 294.

So I do ask for your favorable consideration and Mr. Speaker I will yield to any questions You have a question if you care to yield I do chair recognizes representative Wilkerson Up in the gallery to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a gentle lady yield. Yes, I do can 5% can you equate that in the dollars? No, I actually am not on the board of trustees. I don't have the dollar value there Okay, so four billion wouldn't sound unreasonable if the retirement plan is right on about 80 billion that we would go from zero to four billion and a million minimum and that actually this chamber is Do you yield for another question? Actually, I haven't answered that question yet and it is not a minimum the minimum is zero There is no minimum or max there's no minimum here. So it's a permissive Statute Okay, does it generally be further you know I do and I was going to add on to that right now they cannot Invest anything this would go to 5% However, is it not true this body passed a bill that is sitting in the Senate that would take it to 10% Actually, that is not entirely Accurate it's important to know that there is currently a substitute in the Senate committee that keeps the teacher retirement system cap at 5% Does it generally further you I will yield for I will yield for one more question. Okay, I'll make a say you Thank you to be honest with you We did actually pass a bill at 10% as you said is it's being amended in the Senate that will possibly take it to 5% But at this current moment the only bill we pass was 10% and is it not further true that some of these investments most of us would not be able to Invest in because you would have to be an accredited investor meaning that you would have to have a net worth of over a million dollars a 300,000 dollars in income and so that while I reached out to the teachers the teachers that I reached out personally to or opposed to it Is that not true? If the gentleman so states Do you further yield? Yes, I do chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your ride up in the gallery I do These funds these alternative investments have been used in other parts of the country Can you provide us any information on how well those have performed in other parts of the country where they use this? I can actually provide information about how well they've performed in Georgia the state Employee the the ERS the state plan has been investing in alternative investments and they are seeing a return on investment of approximately 16 14 to 16% Our fireman's fund is seeing a return on investment of approximately 18% in addition the state of Alabama has allowed their teacher retirement system to invest in these alternative investments One of the chosen ones or some golf courses which have proven extremely beneficial So does a downlady further yes So what you're saying is that if we were to do this if we were to allow the teacher retirement system to do these alternative investment that we can guarantee that They will get an increase in the return on investment No, in fact the investments that our teacher retirement system are currently investing in provide no guarantee There are no guarantees in the stock market or in private equities Do you further yield? Yes chair recognizes chairman David Knight to your right for a question I Was what do you I do? Thank you for bringing this bill and thank you for being so informative with it again. I want to Make sure isn't it true? That again this bill simply allows At the professional discretion of the board of trustees. It's over this to use one more tool any you know a limited Fashion as far as it's portfolio is that correct? Yes, that is correct and isn't it further true That is as they balanced the portfolio against the needs or the withdrawals That a balanced portfolio that has longer term investments at higher returns helps This fund in the long term and helps the retirees and making sure that this is a a better Yes, exactly the law as it's written now Does not allow those investors to use their professional judgment to invest in an appropriately diversified portfolio this law will allow them to do so Mr. Speaker I yield the well Lady is yielded the well Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none previous question is ordered Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes those opposed to vote no And the clerk will unlock the machine and call the roll just too many mr.
