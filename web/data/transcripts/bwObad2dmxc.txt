TRANSCRIPT
----------
Please find a seat.
Wow, people are usually going to get that quiet that quick.
Well, good morning again.
I'm going to call this meeting to order for Senate
Resolution 275, the expanding of George's Workforce Study
Committee for our final meeting.
We have had six wonderful meetings throughout this state.
And I mentioned that each one of those as we began.
This was an initiative from a Lieutenant Governor,
Bert Jones and he asked myself and appointed a committee here, which were all present,
in order to explore ways that we could expand George's workforce.
And he is here today to address our committee, so Lieutenant Governor, if you would please
join us, we'd love to hear from you.
All right.
Good morning.
Good morning.
And it's good to be here.
Thank you, Chairman Albers.
I appreciate you having me.
And thank you committee members for participating in this.
This, you know, something that's very important to me and very dear to my heart, I will have
to say that I have been traveling around the state and seeing a lot of different between
our technical colleges, center of Halperin, I've been to our HPCU universities and also
our universities from State Spurrow all the way out to North George as well and a lot
of our college and career academies and we are really hammering home that we've got
to get our young people prepared for workforce development and the thing of this great that's
going on here in the state of Georgia there is a whole lot of opportunities on the business
front and dead men if you're talking about opportunities like Ann and Savannah with
Hyundai EV industry or the Gulf Stream market or if you're talking about
Dalton where you've got the carpet industry or Gainesville where I went to
something that the Daniels construction operation they were doing a big
workforce development involving our young high schoolers you know and they
were teaching them skills and carpentry and electricity and things of that
nature and and so what I have seen is that there's plenty of activity out there going on with
private businesses and things of that nature and we've got to build as a state harness those
opportunities and partner with those different groups around the state to help build out our workforce
and we need to be focused on at every level from K through 12 to the technical colleges as well
to our university systems.
And I just want to make a special thank you
to my good friend, Champ Bailey, who came in
in an early in the session.
And he and I talked about a few things.
And Champ, you know, Champ and I were at George together.
I actually played with his brother more than I did Champ.
And of course, I didn't play much with Champ
when I actually played with him, you know.
He was so much better than all the rest of us.
But at any rate, but when he came in and was talking
about how passionate he was about wanting to give back to his state, you know, like I
have.
I said, well, you know what, let's partner on this and let's see if we can come up.
He's champed from a small town and folks in Georgia, a small town a lot like where I'm
from and we know exactly exactly the limitations that a lot of the young people run into, being
from small communities and things of that nature and so anytime you've got somebody
with his stature and posture and all the accolades
that he's achieved through athletics.
When you've got somebody like that
that wants to be helpful in giving back to communities
like he is around the state, it's meaningful.
And I wanted to harness that and say,
we're gonna do some other projects as soon as this is over
with, so we're looking forward to the recommendations,
chairman Albert's that you're gonna come with.
But I think we have a good idea.
I know y'all've met a lot, and I really appreciate
everyone's time in doing that.
I know that y'all are doing this out of the love for you
communities, and most people in here are doing this
from a voluntary basis, and I appreciate that.
I appreciate the senators who've served on here,
Brandon Beach, who's the head of our economic development.
And I'll say, as I mentioned, Senator Halperin,
she and I have several projects going on that include a lot of it includes
workforce development and things of that nature and like I said this is one of
those things that it breaks across party lines and everything else because
it's talking about trying to harness the talent that I know we have in this
state and help us continue to be a very prosperous state and a very
continue to have that record of the best place to do business and we
want to have the best workforce you know for businesses to acquire and come
to so thank you all very much senator and I appreciate everyone's time and
everyone who's interested in this and and I look forward to working with y'all
and after we get out we'll get done with the recommendations y'all have a
great day today okay thank you
I want to thank you for your red tape initiative, that will, it will get rid of some cumbersome
regulation but it will also streamline the licensing process so we can get people to
work that are coming to our state, that are licensed in other states and we can get
these people to work and it will help from a workforce development standpoint.
So thank you for your red tape rollback, appreciate it.
Thank you.
Great point.
Thank you again, Lieutenant Governor Jones, for putting his faith in trust and honor for
all of us to serve.
I want to take a moment to thank our working committee first.
This group has, as mentioned, spent a lot of time when we're not meeting, preparing
for those meetings, gathering information, getting all the logistics put together.
They've done a phenomenal job.
And we are going to have a photo with both our committee and our working committee right
After this is done, we're going to walk down the steps over here to the Grand
Stair case on the south side of the building to get that committee photo done.
So please don't leave before we get that accomplished.
Next, I want to thank each one of you.
You spent a lot of time away from your day jobs, other things that you have to
focus on at home.
My friend Ryan Pernes and I, we've had to have more important discussions at his
restaurant.
We're going to have to have many more in the coming days.
I just know that will be the case.
I think it's going to be disappointing to a lot of Georgians that champs not going to
be at the next committee meeting to take a picture with, though, and you've been very
gracious with your time and status.
But folks, you spent a lot of time doing this, whether it be traveling to different areas
as well as giving us your input, asking good questions, and I do very much appreciate
what has been done.
At this moment, before we get to the final report, I'm going to ask if anybody on the committee
Has any final thoughts or things they'd like to address
to the committee and those that are watching here
in person or on video?
Senator Halpern, your three.
Go right ahead.
I would like to just say that the work of this committee
has been really important and just a thank you to you,
Mr. Chairman and the Working Committee
for the organization, the ability for us to look
at the full angles of small business and big business
across a number of different industry sectors
to really get our hands around
where the problems are not just anecdotally,
but also through data,
and being able to take all that information
and compile it into a final report
that I think we can all be proud of.
Thank you.
Other, Senator Beach?
Mr. Stecco, what Senator Halpern said,
and thank you for this committee
in doing the hard work.
I can tell you as somebody that does economic development,
not only do I chair economic development,
I will see you in the chamber for 15 years
and still do economic development in North Fulton.
Workforce is an issue across industries.
I mean, I don't care if it's healthcare
or what industry it is, workforce is an issue
and we've got to tackle it.
And I will tell you some of the recommendations
going to these meetings and hearing how
the carpet industry is working with the Department
of Corrections, for example,
and some of the unique things that are being done
and how we have to continue to work with not only high schools but now down to middle schools
and really get these kids on career paths where they can, you know, we heard from the
Ford dealership gentleman that you can make six figures and it's not an auto mechanic
anymore. It's a computer job. It's a technology job now in these car dealerships. So we really
I learned a lot and it opened my eyes up, but we've got to make sure we're, I'm a firm believer the private sector creates jobs, not government, but what we can do is create a conducive environment and give the private sector the tools to be successful and I think that's what this committee is going to do and some of these recommendations, I like these recommendations a lot.
I also brought up the point about how the construction industry has used these simulators to really train people.
And I think that's something we need to continue to fund and look at across industries,
these simulators that get these kids involved and get them to want to do these jobs.
And so I just want to thank you, Ms. Chairman, for this committee.
And thank you for the folks that don't serve in the Senate that were on this committee.
Thank you for that.
And I'll make a motion at the proper time after everybody else speaks.
fantastic and we're going to do a summary of the report and I think one of the things
that we all learned as well as the incredible work that Commissioner Dozier and his staff
are doing on our technical college system for those that are not aware of that great
work.
Hopefully this was an enlightening experience and you're really doing an amazing job, your
leadership and your vision so thank you, Commissioner, we appreciate your help.
Thank you.
I could just...
Please.
Mr. Chairman and committee, thank you so much for the focus.
One of the things I've had the blessing for four years to be part of TCSG and honestly
the legacy of TCSG and the hard work precedes me coming four years ago.
It's just an incredible group of folks that are trying to change lives and change communities.
So one of the things I just want to say is thank you.
The team out there is working hard.
The focus is on workforce and the team is ready to step up and we appreciate your focus
personally in this committees and the lieutenant governor.
We stand ready.
So, thank you.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Other members of the committee?
Any final thoughts?
All right, we're going to then turn it over to Haley.
Now, I wanna just take a moment to thank,
again, the working committee,
but specifically the work that Haley did.
This has been a lot of information.
And not only has she assembled and took all this
and created what you see in front of you,
which are the findings,
but there's gonna be an appendix
that's gonna go with this.
It's gonna have all of the volume of information
that we have received during this process.
She also worked with each of our speakers
to make sure their presentations
were addressing the needs of the committee,
getting them ahead of time,
working with our Senate Press team
in order to make sure we had those available to view
and we had copies made and all that stuff like that.
So thank you for all your great work.
And if you just give us kind of a high level summary,
we're not gonna go point by point.
But for those that are listening,
the members of this committee got this report last week.
So they had time to review, make any suggested ads or changes.
And like any report, we think we made this just about right.
Not too too specific where it was one group that wanted something that was just for them,
but not too high level that it can't be meaningful.
From this report, though, what you're going to see in which is the initiative of our
Lieutenant Governor is legislation, budget, and other things are going to come out of this.
This was not just an opportunity for us to get together and review, it was an opportunity
for us to get something meaningful to act upon.
And I'm going to look forward when we have those bills in front of full Senate committees
and full House committees in 2024, I'm going to ask some of you to please come back and
testify those committees because while it's important to hear from legislators, it's
more important to hear from those who are industry leaders who have been a part of the process.
So with that, Haley, I'm going to turn it over to you and turn your microphone on.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm on to.
Yes.
All right.
Thank you.
First of all, Chairman.
Very kind words.
I'm very happy to be useful.
Moving on to the findings and recommendations section of the report.
We broke them down into policy recommendations and legislative recommendations.
Some of the policy recommendations will kind of overlap with legislative recommendations.
but it's organized in a way that it's pretty easy to follow.
First of all, the workforce marketing was a trend across each and every meeting that we saw,
every single employer that we heard from expressed that it was very difficult to just inform people that certain jobs even exist and the benefits of them.
them. So each of these touch on different initiatives for that, but I wanted to highlight the state-facilitated
free platform, like Indeed, for all Georgia employers to use, because I think that was something
that everyone was really excited about, and that will be something that is likely moved
into a legislative initiative as well. K-12 and higher education. Of course, we also heard
from countless employers that these are,
this is where it starts.
So each of these initiatives are things
that could theoretically be done unilaterally
by education systems, our local education agencies,
and our state education agencies, particularly
Cleaning up the CTAE pathways.
Those are highlighted in the K through 12 education policy
recommendations.
Goodness, what mouthfuls.
And under higher education, you'll
see several initiatives just encouraging TCSG
to continue what they're doing, essentially,
with more support from the legislature.
And something that was highlighted in that
is basically finding ways to celebrate acceptance
and attendance at TCSU institutions.
Our next and final subcategory under our policy recommendations
will be inclusivity.
And that is encompassing various subpopulations
by especially the population of Georgians
that have developmental disabilities,
which we heard from multiple employers as well,
that we are just not reaching that subpopulation.
Does anyone want to discuss these policy recommendations
before we move on to the legislative?
or if you see anything specifically
that you would like clarity on, okay?
Seeing none, continue on.
Wonderful, so the legislative recommendations
are a little more concise.
First of all, the articulation agreements,
we all heard multiple times
that we need a better system for the transfer of credits
and that will require legislation
under licensing, the pretty standard points of discussion,
such as reciprocity agreements,
and just generally increasing flexibility
in obtaining licensure.
Under program funding,
I'll go ahead and just touch on these individually
since they're only a few.
Increased funding for tuition reimbursement
in high demand fields,
and those examples include nursing or even technical degrees
such as welding certifications and things like that.
A grant program for high school graduates
to work for a local government entity of some sort
just to incentivize a gap year for students
to get some real world experience
and contribute to their communities.
And that was specifically brought out
by the Lieutenant Governor's Office as well.
And the funding for the statewide employment portal
that we talked about in the policy recommendations.
And finally, we did talk a lot about benefit cliffs,
but, and there have been really good studies.
Daniela sent over some studies that have already been done
that are really excellent,
but we did agree that we should probably engage
in further study for specific communities,
revisiting programs who encourage
and instead of eyes retirees return to the workforce.
And we also touched on with Senator Hickman,
these childcare centers that are operating
in Effingham and Bryan counties
where local school systems are building child care centers
for the teachers and staff who work for those school systems.
And finally, pass SB 112,
which will establish the Excel Center pilot program,
which will award high school diplomas
to adults over the age of 21.
Excellent work.
Thank you for giving us that overview and summary.
Any final thoughts from the committee members?
Senator Hickman, go right ahead.
Well, thank you, and I am very excited
that F&M County and Bryan County
are building daycare centers for their teachers,
and I think that's a big, big leak.
Let me mention one other quick thing
that came up yesterday is that,
you know, when we look at the QBE formula,
the QBE formula funds one counts
for every 400 students in a school,
and we know that's a big, big issue,
but what we came up on yesterday was,
those counts were primary academic counselors.
Maybe in some point in time,
we need to be looking at career counselors for high schools.
To help these students, I keep going children,
help these students determine what career they want to go into
rather than take geometry or whatever.
I think that's a big, big thing.
And the other big thing I think is,
and it came through the hearings was,
how much we need more businesses involved in
working with the schools and providing,
you know, if Delta Airlines wants to recruit out of
of certain schools, maybe dealt with airlines,
needs to step up and provide the simulators
for type things, and I think those type things,
and I think we can't, we got,
I know in our accounting world,
we're very involved in the universities,
and we know by being involved in the university,
we get opportunities to get the dream
and the property account that's coming out of the school,
and I think that's what our business
is going to be thinking about at the same situation.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator Hickman.
any other comments?
Yes, Dave, number one, number five, okay?
Jeremy, thank you very much.
I'd like to circle back just briefly
to the policy recommendations under K-12 education.
There's a number of really good, solid recommendations.
There are one that I know that the General Assembly
has made some progress on already.
It's in the area of computer science courses
and providing staff to teach those courses
in our Georgia high schools.
A number of states throughout the country,
I was just doing a search on my way in,
including three of our neighboring states
in North Carolina just became effective last month,
required computer science,
passage of computer science course
for as a graduation requirement.
And we saw one of the things that really impressed me
about everything that we heard on all these meetings
was how important technology is to every job
that we create today in Georgia.
So I would potentially offer that for inclusion
so that we could be on par with other states
that we're competing with.
Yeah, no, I agree.
In fact, I've already had some conversations with Senator Clinton-Dicks, and he is the
chair of our education committee for K-12 and discuss that.
And I think we've had a pretty good dialogue of how our education system has to evolve
now, right?
We've talked pretty much the same way K-12 and especially the University of Status for
about 85 years now, but the world has changed many times over.
And I think we use the example that Commissioner Dozer and TCSG has done, but we need to apply
that same methodology from kindergarten to 12th grade and then certainly at our university
level as well.
Thank you.
Other questions or comments?
Mr. Sorry.
Hang on a second.
What number are you there?
Eight.
Okay.
Go right in.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to point out that we actually do have a point in the policy recommendations
on high school counselors to your point, Chairman Hickman.
That's something we've heard consistently that if students don't have guidance to help
them work through these college options and technical college options, they won't kind
of be able to make their best decisions.
So just appreciate all your work on the Higher Education Committee and certainly echo
your thoughts to on making sure that we've got employers engaged.
I know that's kind of a consistently what our businesses are asking for us to get more
involved in the K-12 system.
So appreciate your leadership and then the work of this committee to make that easier so
So we can really build strategic pipons that benefit students.
Thank you, Danielle.
And yes, Senator Hickman's literacy work that he's been doing with his committee and
the legislation he's worked on has been extraordinary because child can't read.
Then we've got a lot of problems ahead of them.
So thank you for your great work.
Other comments or questions to committee members?
Seeing none, I'm going to recognize Senator Beach for emotion.
Mr. Chairman, I've moved to approve the Senate Study Committee report on expanding Georgia workforce.
that was created by Senate Resolution 275.
Second.
And we've got a second from Senator Halpern.
Is there any further discussion
before we take a vote on this committee report?
Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.
Aye.
All opposed, please say no.
It passes unanimously.
Thank you very much, we appreciate that.
The next step for this is we will print out
the final report, we will sign it,
we'll submit it back to the Lieutenant Governor's Office
and to the Secretary of the Senate.
It will also go up on the website.
If you remember, expanding Georgia's work for study
is a active website.
We will keep it up for some time to make sure everybody
can see the work that was done here.
It will also be posted on the General Assembly website,
which is ledges.ga.gov.
You'll be able to find that report there as well.
I know after committees are over,
typically everybody wants to chat either here
or with the folks that are here in the audience,
but I'm going to ask you to give us a pass right now,
because as soon as we're done, I'm gonna ask everybody
if we can walk right out this door to the side.
We're gonna go down the stairs and get our picture made
before everybody goes in different directions.
So at this time, we're gonna conclude this study committee
and call this meeting here by adjourned.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
