Doors keep us, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 16th House District, Representative Shrely Kelly. Thank you Mr. Speaker, happy cross-over-day colleagues. It is my honor to get to introduce Pastor Justin Carter to you this morning from the second Baptist Church in Cedar Town. Now I worship at my dad's church, World View Baptist, but second Baptist and pastor Carter's church is just across the street. And my aunt and uncle worship under Pastor Carter, and I can assure you that they benefit from the ministry that he provides them. Justin's married to his wife Sarah, they have a daughter Maggie, and a son Jack who's here with us, along with a member of his congregation Sheila Barrett. Would y'all please stand up so we can recognize y'all please? Justin got his undergraduate degree at the University of West Georgia where I found out this morning he attended with our Pro-Temps Legal Counsel Tyler Mashburn. He shared with me that they ran for the SGA together on the slate, and I was there both of their first introduction to how dirty politics can be. He got his pastoral ministry degree from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and was a bivocational pastor. He was a history teacher before coming full time to second Baptist in 2018. Justin's active in our community with life matters outreach, Justin in his church run, one of the largest recovery ministries in our community in our region. And I know he's going to share some of the good work that they've done there. Outside of his ministry, Justin enjoys reading mostly history books, but he's also talented in playing the guitar and the piano. So I'm just honored to get to introduce Pastor Justin Carter to y'all today on this crossover. Thank you. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker and Representative Kelly for the opportunity to be here today at the Capitol, and I'm honored to share a few words of encouragement before you start your busy day here at State Capitol. I was here many years ago as a page as a young boy, and I remember getting my picture taken with the late Speaker Tom Murphy right up here. He used to let us hold the gavel for that picture and accidentally walked off with the gavel. But I didn't get too far, so hopefully I won't do that today. I'm joined here today by my son Jack and our ministry assistant at the church, Ms. Sheila Barrett. Sheila retired from many years of working at the Georgia Department of Labor, and her father was the late sheriff of Pope County for many years. Her sister actually worked in the governor's office as well for several decades. After Sheila retired, she faced several battles in her personal life. What started as an addiction alcohol, a spiraled into an addiction with drugs. And like others across our state, Sheila experienced overwhelming grief in 2010 at the passing of her 22-year-old son Brent due to an accidental drug overdose. That led Sheila down a very long and difficult path, one that involved addiction, arrests, jail time, broken relationships, and probation. When I first came to the church at Second Bab, just members had mentioned to me about Sheila being in jail. And I remember praying for her, not knowing who she was or what exactly she was struggling with. In what seemed like an impossible situation, God was not done with Ms. Sheila Barrett. Thanks changed a little later on when my precious wife Sarah saw Sheila at the local grocery store. She had gotten out of jail, and my wife had been praying for her, and she went up to her and said, are you Sheila Barrett? And she said, yes, I am. And my wife invited her back to church that day. Well the following Sunday, Sheila showed up at Second Bab to church, to worship with us, and she was welcome with open arms. She began attending our new Celebrate Recovery program that had just started that year. And she became instrumental in managing our social media pages. She followed her probation rules meticulously, and began helping others in their fight for recovery. She became our ministry assistant for hospitality at the church. And she greets every guest we have on Sunday morning. She has made it her life's ambition to honor the memory of her son, Brent, and to share the love of Christ everywhere she goes. She has been on mission trips, just about every mission trip we have had as a church. She has been Idaho, El Salvador, Louisiana, and she just got back from her third trip.

to the nation of Cuba. She has reconciled with her family and she'll be off probation on September 15th of this year. With God, as scripture says, all things are possible. I share her story to illustrate to you the power of community and connection and most importantly, the power of a God of second chances. A God who leads us and God's us every day, a God who is with us as a very present help in trouble. And as you start off your day here at the Capitol, I want to encourage you to remember the people just like Sheila all over our state. They deserve the opportunity to freely pursue God's plan for their lives to be provided with the resources needed to make their next step in life a more successful and a more prosperous one. And I want to thank you for your service to the people of this great state. Our prayers are with you and our prayers for wisdom and discernment are with this whole house and this capital of day as you make very important decisions that impact the millions of people all across the great state of Georgia. Would you stand with me and prayer? Our Heavenly Father, I ask for your blessings and divine guidance for the men and women in the Georgia House of Representatives. We pray for speaker burns and leadership of this chamber. As they go throughout their day today, I pray that they can fill the presence of your Holy Spirit and experience your love that passes all understanding. God, we ask for you to bless the people of our state. We pray that this would be a place where Godly wisdom and righteousness would prevail. We pray that you would allow our communities to flourish and our people to experience your grace. We ask this the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Would you join me in the pledge? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. That's strong. Thank you. Pastor Carter, thank you for that message. Sheila, thank you for being here. Thank you for your journey your own and we'll say a prayer for you as well. Jack, good to have you to, my friend. Good to be with you. Doorkeepers, you may open the doors. Members, you may join Pastor Carter in the south any room.

House Bill 532, by the represent of the Loch, the 167th of be titled, and act to amend Code Section 12, 6A 12. Are the fiscal to George Antietta relating the annual grant when state owns properties and calculations, so as revised provisions related to certain counties claiming such grant, this bill emphurred the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Darien, Chairman Buddy Deloote, is recognized to present the bill for representing Deloote. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope you'll allow me to start off this morning by saying that I suspect my O-Seatmate Terry England is watching us this morning. And so I want to take this opportunity to say, Terry, I don't tell you one more time, how much I love you. And I want to tell you that you might not be physically present on this floor this morning. Which is spirit and your influence is felt here every day and will continue to be until you get back here and we look forward to that. And I also briefly need to say thank you and now I'll talk about this bill. House Bill 532 strikes from the Code Section. Two lines, line 40 and 41. And on the last page, line 69 and 70 and the effect of those two things is to allow the Department of Natural Resources to use grant money that we appropriate every year to pay counties for actual work such as road grading and maintenance that they do on state property. And I'll speak for you for no questions. I'll yield the well. Gentlemen has no questions. Did a good job. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the Committee's agreed to. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All of those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine? From the passage of House Bill 532, the A's are 168, the A's are zero. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there for passed? Mr. Clerk will you read a caption to House Bill 52? Five two? House Bill 5 too, by the way, I'm going to rise to the hundred and thirty-ninth and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 485, 48. The official code of Georgia annotated really in a homestead exemption by qualified disabled veterans filing requirements. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends a disbilled do pass. Representative Rice, Representative Carmen Rice has recognized to present House Bill 52. The ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everyone. This bill, Bill 52, was presented last year by Representative Clay Parkle, if you recall. And the bill passed unanimously through the House, so it's another one that we're moving to the Senate again. And this bill is clarifying language as there's been some confusion in some counties regarding homestead exemption for the unremaried spouses and minor children of a deceased disabled veteran. As these families move from county to county across our state, as often happens during a lifetime change, this bill clarifies that the unremaried spouse and minor children of a disabled veteran would maintain their homestead exemption status. This is not extending the exemption, but rather clarifies exemption would travel with them to that residence. Some counties were interpreting one way and some are interpreting another. This bill gives consistency and predictability to surviving unremaried spouses and minor children of our veterans across our state. With that, Speaker, I'll take questions. The lady has a question to your left down front. One of your, let's see, I think she represents that part of the state you come from, representative Hugh Lee from the Columbus delegation is recognized to ask her question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman here, General Lacey Yeal? Yes. Isn't true that we have a lot of military spouses in our area and people in Columbus will appreciate you doing this for them. Absolutely. Thank you. The lady has no further questions. Thank you. I'm honored to present this bill on behalf of our veteran families in Georgia and I ask for your vote and support. It's great when folks work together. Ladies, you are the will. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Yes, all those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose represented to have the rise? Ponderary inquiry, sir. State your inquiry, ma'am. Is it not true that I will be supporting this bill simply because of the effort that it causes to maintain the integrity of this body's effort to support the veterans in this state? I'm not a lady to be a veteran and support veteran, so thank you for the inquiry. Thank you, sir. For what purpose represented new rise? Ponderary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that this is the representative's first bill? Thank you, representative. Do you? She almost slipped away. I had a question. I guess I could do a Ponderary inquiry, but I guess I won't. I bet you will get you back up. The vote is changing dramatically. Oh, it's getting worse all the time. Mr. Clerk, you better hurry up. No, we're not going to close it. Let's see. I have a question I want to recognize for what purpose is chairman Martin rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to have to get some help, so I don't go anywhere. State your inquiry. Yes, sir. This is to you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to know this gentleman's opinion on the lady slipping in there and getting it by us. You said you had a thought on that. My Parliamentary inquiry, would you clear to share that with the body? I think she's one of the smarter members of this body to do that, so very stealthy. Have all members now voted? Congratulations, I think. Have all members now voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? The only one that passes is House Bill 52. The Yees are 170 and the Yees are 5. You'll pay for that. I'd be writing that letter to the clerk right now if I were you. Congratulations. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority, 178, Yees 170 days 5. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 425425? House Bill 425, I represent a perchetta of 176 to be entitled to an act to amend Article 2, Chapter 7 and Title 48, the official bill to George Antittor, relating to imposition rate computation exemptions and credits, so it's a reward for a tax credit for the purchase of emergency power generators. This bill having for the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee substitute. The perchette is recognized to present the bill, the gentleman from the 176 House District. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. No, be brief. Colleagues, I bring before you House Bill 425, it is a disaster prepared in this bill. What the bill seeks to do is allow for a tax credit for generators and switches for gas stations and nursing care facilities. The cap is $25,000 per store and the aggregate cap is $5 million. It's only allowable through December 31, 2026. The intent of this bill is to assure that our gas stations put in a generator and a switch. So when the power goes out for 24 days, that folks can get gas a lien to put in their generators, as well as nursing care facilities will be able to have the incentive to put in a generator so that their vulnerable folks will be able to have power to recharge oxygen tanks and things of that nature. And that's the nature of the bill, Mr. Speaker. If I have no questions, I will yield a little. You have a couple of questions. Very good. We're going to see if you're newton to your right. It has a question. Jim was recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's gentleman yield. Yes, my friend, I do. Isn't it true that these convenience stores with gasoline but also necessary food stuffs, milk, everything that was needed or crucial in that swath of Georgia from Baldaastah through Augusta that made such a difference during Hurricane Helene. They were some of the first to get open. They tried to stay open even 24 hours a day in so many areas. And it's true that we appreciate the effort they did and this is going to help them do it even better the next time. Yes, 100%. And thank you to the chairman for helping perfect the bill. Representative Carpenter, do you write in the Reurs, recognize for a question? Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true this legislation would greatly help the businesses and the people of South Georgia that were devastated with the hurricanes? It will help everybody in the state. Yes, sir. Thank you. For that, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to yield the well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? No further questions. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Hearing none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill hearing none the report of the Committee is agreed to shall. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 425, the yeas are a 171, the nays are two. This bill hearing see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 111-111? The House Bill 111 by the representative from the 103rd to be entitled an act to amend the Article 2 Chapter 7 of the Title 48 of the Fish and Co. George Anated really in the impositionary competition exemptions and credits relative to income taxes so to reduce the rate of tax this bill ever for the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends the disbilled do pass. Who representative Hong, the Governor's floor leader, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleys, I bring before you HB1-11 on behalf of Governor Camp to accelerate the tax cut for George's individual income tax. The origin of this tax cut acceleration goes back to 2022 legislative session when the general assembly passed and the Governor signed into law HB1437 to provide the largest income tax cut in our state's history. The original bill plan to initiate a flat tax beginning at 5.49% for tax year 2024 from 5.75 in 2023 and then allowed for an annual step down in our income tax rate to an eventual 4.99% by tax year 2029. However, things too are conservative budgeting and your support last year we accelerated the rate from 5.49% to 5.39% for tax year 2024 with HB1015. This bill and this year's proposal will further accelerate the rate by an additional 20 basis points to bring the rate from 5.39% to 5.19% effective July 1st, 2025 for tax year 2025. This acceleration and the reduction will save the taxpayers $860 million. Overall, this additional 20 basis point reduction will be part of a 56 basis point total reduction in individual income tax since the Governor signed into law HB1437. Essentially, we started at 5.75% back in 2023 and now we are looking to get down to 5.19% just in a three year timeframe. While other states are raising taxes on their citizens and while we're facing sky high prices and can least afford it, we are doing the opposite here in Georgia. We have a surplus budget and we are able to put money back into our taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill and I'll take any questions. Lady has a couple of questions and all that members know we have a number of speakers signed up to speak their opposed to this bill. I'm a recognized representative and drenner for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I do. Isn't it true that in the past few weeks we've seen uncertainty and federal funding and tariffs from the new administration. We've seen talks of cuts to K through 12 school funding cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. And is this really the best time to accelerate an income tax cut that primarily benefits wealthy people in Georgia? Thank you, Representative. Several things in that comment. We've been dealing with inflation for the last four years. Yet during that time, Georgia has had a surplus and we have conservatively budgeted. So therefore, that's why this year and last year we're able to accelerate and still be able to keep up with all of our expenses. I don't think that this bill only benefits the wealthy. This is a overall will get a tax cut for all Georgians. It will benefit 100% of Georgians. The group that they've weighed to your right in the back is recognized for a question. Does the general lady yield? I do. Is it not true due to our fiscal conservatism and the fact that Georgia has been the number one place in which to do business for over decade? We're in a position to be able to provide this tax relief for Georgians. Absolutely. And that is exactly why we are able to do this for our hardworking Georgians. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman Blackman, right up the center aisle on your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the general lady yield? I do. Is it true the original legislation provided for a significant increase in the standard deduction and was front loaded with that increase and took many Georgia taxpayers off the tax rolls entirely as well as provided that $32,000 for a family of four would not be taxed. Absolutely. And you would know, you would know the best. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. Representative Clark to your, I'm live, resident Jasmine Clark. Dr. Can I ask for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the generality yield? I do. So, can you give us some numbers? If I am an individual that makes about, let's say, $40,000, $45,000 a year, what does this tax credit look like for my family? Let's say I'm a family of three. So it's not a tax credit, it's a tax rate cut. So whatever you, when you file your regular income tax, the amount that you are being taxed, that rate is being lower. So I can't do the math in my head right now, but whatever you are paying in your, the tax rate is being reduced. And that's why I say it is being reduced for all Georgians. So whether you make $300,000 or you make $40,000, you are paying a less rate and a lower rate for your income tax. Thank you. The lady, we have a couple of questions, but the leader of the illustration right now in front of the years, I'm gonna ask for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the generality yield? I do. Ma'am, is it not true that if this body passes House Bill 111, we're on track for Georgians to keep more of their hard earned funds and to show our commitment to keeping Georgia, the number one state to live, work and raise a family. Absolutely. And again, this is for all Georgians. We wanna make sure that they get their hard working tax, pay our money back. And this is what this bill does. Mr. Speaker, I know we have a long day and there are many people that are signed up to speak. So I will yield the well. Thank you. The lady is yielding the well. We have a number of folks who are wanna speak to their opposed to the bill. We have three that oppose the referencing draper, the same chairs and remind. I'm gonna give you up to five minutes. Up to five minutes, referencing draper is recognized. Let me see if I can pick this up here. All right. All right, Mr. Speaker, members of the general assembly. I rise today not out of opposition to tax relief, but out of a deep concern for fiscal responsibility and to hold this chamber accountable to the standards that we set for ourselves just last year. Commule fashioned, but I like to do what I say and say what I mean.

Last year, I voted yes for HB 1015, which was a measured plan to ratchet down the income tax rate over multiple years. If you were in the house last year, you probably voted yes for that bill too. The final tally for that bill was 165 je votes and zero nay votes. I left a copy of House Bill 1015 on everyone's desk, but let me break it down for you. House Bill 1015 promised a .1% income tax reduction in 2024, from 5.49% to 5.39%. But then it went on to say that beginning this year, the tax rate should be reduced another .1%. So long as, so long as, certain financial benchmarks were reached. The bill goes on to say, keep reducing that tax rate by a tenth of a percentage every point, every year, so long as we continue to meet those financial health markers. And what does the bill say to do if we don't hit those financial health markers? It says delay further tax rate reductions for a year, reassess if we are hitting our goals and proceed from there. And you know what? I was good with that approach because it was thoughtful and conservative approach to tax relief. It balanced the return of revenue to Georgians with the financial health of the Georgia economy. I also really appreciated that it gave Georgia citizens, businesses and industry a guide map for how we were going to approach tax relief over the course of the next several years. I like the idea of giving the public information they can use to plan for the future. And I certainly believe that if we choose to give the public a guide map that we know they will rely on in planning, we should stick to that guide map. We should not do is tell the public we are going to do one thing and then reverse course the very next year. But that is precisely what we are doing with House Bill 111. Georgia did not meet its financial benchmarks that we laid out in House Bill 1015. That was a prerequisite for additional tax relief in 2025. Had we reached those benchmarks, we would have automatically received another tax rate reduction this year without the need for this bill. But we didn't. We didn't meet those benchmarks. And instead of holding ourselves to our own standards, we are now passing legislation to circumvent the rules that we thought were necessary. That is not fiscal responsibility. How do we know we didn't meet our financial benchmarks that we laid out in the HB 1015? Well, one of these benchmarks is that the governor's revenue estimate for the next fiscal year must be 3% higher than the current year. That is lines 21 and 22 of the bill of HB 1015 if you are following along. The 2026 revenue estimate is not 3% higher than the 2025 revenue estimate. As a matter of fact, it is 7% lower. So in other words, we didn't even come close to reaching our goal. And you don't have to take my word for it. Take the word from the governor's office of planning and budget. Under HB 1015, the Georgia office of planning and budget is charged with determining whether we meant those financial benchmarks. And if we had, it would have had to issue a report to the speaker and to key legislators saying as much. Well, I went over to the office of planning and budget and asked for the report. What they told me is that since we did not meet our financial benchmarks, they did not produce the report so they did not have a report to give me. HB 111 basically asks us to ignore our vote last year on HB 1015. It asks us to ignore the wisdom in that bill of not reducing tax rates further if the financial health of the state cannot support it. And why are we ignoring HB 1015? Why are we undoing our own work so that certain elected officials who have higher political aspirations can campaign on giving tax breaks? Even if it has a dire financial impact on Georgia, even when it goes against the standards that we set in this legislative branch, to that I say no. Carry your own water. If you want to give tax rates, tax breaks, meet the standards that we have set in this chamber. I see my time is done. So Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you, Representative Draper. Representative Sanchez has recognized for up to five minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am here opposed to House Bill 111 because Georgians are tired of a government that is only benefiting the wealthy elite and not the rest of us. This bill provides essentially a flat tax cut for Georgians in theory that sounds equal. But in the real world, Georgians do not make the same income. The top 5% are making at least $300,000 a year while the bottom 20% are making barely $20,000 a year. Instead of fixing this huge disparity, we are giving a massive wasteful tax cut to the wealthiest Georgians and not investing in programs that serve everyone in this state. Nearly half of Georgians will only receive 5% of the benefits of this bill as you can see from the chart. That means the median family will get this $70 a year from this bill. That is less than $6 a month. That doesn't even cover a Mula cookout anymore. Little loan, childcare, rent, health insurance, energy bills, or your kids' college tuition. Our state ranks third highest in the nation on inequality. The average rent has gone up $400 a month since 2020 in Georgia. Our people are hurting at a time where the federal government is cutting much into services for our community. This assembly is failing to step up to the plate to help working Georgians. Instead of providing help for our people, we are proposing to not invest in our agencies that help regular people and instead benefit the wealthy. But hey, at least you'll get an extra cup of coffee every month. Working Georgians deserve tax relief. I agree. Do you know what they deserve even more than that? The ability to work 40 hours a week on one income and be able to live comfortably, buy a house, and support their families. Instead of giving working Georgians crumbs and doing a victory lap, how about we actually invest in our people and invest in our communities? How about we invest in affordable healthcare for Georgians? As has been said many times, expanding Medicaid will give 440,000 uninsured people in Georgia insurance. Affordable healthcare. What about affordable housing? How about we invest in building homes in Georgia to increase supply and stop these huge corporations buying up all this property, jacking up the prices and making it unaffordable for the rest of us? Instead of giving $70 a year back to working Georgians, how about we pay them $20 an hour of living wage so they can afford to live and thrive in our state? Instead of addressing these dire crises, we're pouring money down the drain to give a nice tax cut to the wealthiest of Georgians, some of which happen to be in this room. Because let's be frank, this is a bill made by the wealthy for the wealthy. So let's stop wasting our time with handouts to the wealthy and instead invest in working families here in Georgia. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the wealth. Gentlemen, I have a question, but a year to the well, Representative Ramon is recognized for up to five minutes, the ladies recognize the speed. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues today I rise in opposition of House Bill 111. House Bill 111 is being sold as a tax cut, but it's frankly a scam for most Georgians. We hear the reasons for this bill is to try to keep more money in Georgians pockets to spend how they see fit. The problem is this bill is it currently exists would barely return about $70 as you heard for the entire year to most Georgians while continuing to underfund important programs. In fact, the cost of about $748 million would go, which 70% of that would go to the top earners in our state making six figures or more, but just 4% of that, just 4% going to the rest. The thing is, it is getting harder every day just to make ends meet for so many people. We're experiencing larger economic factors than anybody is willing to be honest about last year, and while we bicker about politics, your average everyday family is struggling more every day. We're seeing, for example, worsening student outcomes, while there are many reasons for this, one is a lot of teachers can no longer afford to teach, and on top of that as we lose teachers, our classroom sizes are expanding. And more than that, you don't think that a child whose parents can't afford to put food on the table isn't going to struggle and eventually act out. We're expecting more from children that we are hurting than ourselves. And while this may be an impassioned speech about tax breaks, it's also about our values. These parents are being forced to take on two to three jobs, sometimes four. They're doing this to make ends meet, and we're saying to them, you know what? We'll throw you a little something, but we're going to keep the rest to give to those that we know. And it's been tax break after tax break that benefits the very few. Oh, and by the way, we're also telling them that as things get harder, we are also going to make it harder for them to qualify for necessary programs. And on top of that, we're also going to refuse to expand already existing programs to help more Georgians because we don't have enough money. And we don't have enough money because we keep giving it to the top earners. And on and on and on. Our values are so upside down. The reason we have this bill, as my colleague mentioned, is we're actually behind benchmarks. And I think it's a travesty that we keep saying we can't expand Medicaid because of money. We can't provide a poverty wait for the QBE formula because of money. But we can absolutely give the already wealthy back more money. You don't think this is selling our future for cents on the dollar? You don't think that lack of investment our children is going to matter down the line? It matters to Georgians. There are ways to put more money back in people's pockets without taking what little they have. There are programs and bills on the table like the earned income tax credit that lets parents spend more time with their kids. But instead of doing programs like that in our state, we're dangling a little bit to agree to give up so much more. Colleagues, I strongly urge you to support me in opposition to this bill. The decisions we make here and the values we have are beyond contradictory and they are causing a lot of pain in our state so we can pat ourselves on the back for saying that we provided a tax cut. Because here's the reality. Giving people tax breaks like this is the equivalent of skipping out on your bills and handing out money to make you popular. It gets you some pats on the back. It might even get you an award. But the reality is your bills are still unpaid. The same applies to this. The same applies to the surplus. We have people struggling and we keep money sitting in our banks. We're not even going to bother to expand how much we're helping you. That's what we're saying today. I want to be clear this is not envy. I know a lot of you think that the reason many of us have this attitude is because we think, oh, we're just upset about what people have. But I want you to understand the deep-seated concern that I have is greed that we continue to enable that has continued to squeeze Americans and Georgians more and more. Everything now has a shareholder fee. Everything now is more predatory and extraction area and we expect people to be okay while we continue to build hurdle after hurdle. This is not only immoral. It's also bad for a healthy and robust market. Today, the top 10% of earners account for 50% of all spending because the other 90% can't even afford the basics. You heard me correctly. Not only can they not afford to slurge, splurge, they cannot afford the basics, meaning people and workers specifically are being pushed into homelessness. They're not just becoming homeless because they're not working. They are working and becoming homeless. It is our job to level the playing field and negotiate on behalf of all Georgians, not just our friends. I am tired of becoming middle management for those who want to keep making more money at the expense of everybody else. I strongly urge you to vote no. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the law. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? We do have a minority report for up to 20 minutes and we have three speakers. We'll park us first. We'll let you guys decide how you divide up the time. The president park is recognized to speak to the bill. Mr. Speaker, today I rise not as a Democrat or Republican, but as a proud Georgian committed to the long-term economic strength of our great state. We all share common values, fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity, and ensuring that every hard-working Georgian can afford the basic necessities of life. Unfortunately, House Bill 111 does not reflect these values. Instead, it undermines Georgian financial future while offering literal relief to those who need it most. At a time when inflation has driven up the costs of groceries, rent, and health care, Georgia families need responsible tax policy that alleviates their burden without putting our state's economy at risk. HB111 takes the wrong approach. While it may be marketed as a broad-based tax cut, the reality is, as my colleagues have so eloquently stated, is that it overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Georgians while offering minimal relief to working and middle-class families. I would like to encourage my colleagues and those who are watching, look at the screen. For my colleagues, how many of our constituents are making $2 million and more a year? HB111 reduces the state income tax rate from 5.39% to 5.19% starting in 2025. The benefits are starkly, starkly uneven. The top 20% of earners will receive nearly 80% of the total tax savings with millionaires receiving thousands of dollars and benefits annually. Meanwhile, the bottom 60% of Georgians, those earning middle-class or lower incomes, will see less than $6 a month in savings, for the vast majority of Georgians. You can't even afford a dozen eggs with $6 a month. At the same time, this will cost the state nearly $1 billion in loss revenue by 2026, that may force lawmakers to either cut essential services or increase fees elsewhere to compensate. Now it's been argued that cutting taxes across the board will generate economic growth, but history and economic data tell us otherwise. Past state-level tax cuts of this nature, where the majority of benefits go to the wealthiest, have not resulted in significant job creation or income growth for average families. Instead, they have led to budget shortfalls, underfunded infrastructure, and cuts to essential services like education and health care. Georgia currently boosts a AAA credit rating. The highest possible, which allows us to borrow money at lower interest rates for critical projects like roads, bridges, and public safety, but HB111 jeopardizes this financial standing. By reducing our state's revenue stream without a clear plan to replace it, we risk being forced into reactionary budget cuts that harm essential programs, including law enforcement funding, rule hospital support, and public education. Fiscal conservatism does not mean reckless tax cuts that threaten the state's financial future. True conservative leadership means ensuring a responsible, balanced budget that invests in long-term economic growth while keeping taxes fair and sustainable. If we truly want to reduce the tax burden on working families, there are better solutions. Expand targeted tax relief for low and in-middle income Georgians through increased exemptions and credits, approaches that directly put money in the pockets of those who need it most. Invest in infrastructure, health care, and workforce development, which not only create jobs, but also drive long-term economic growth that benefits Georgians. Let's ensure fiscal responsibility by aligning tax cuts with clear, sustainable sources of revenue rather than relying on optimistic projections that can lead to future deficits. HB111 is not a responsible approach to tax reform. It is a risky, top-heavy tax giveaway that benefits a few at the expense of the money. It is bad economics, bad policy, and bad for Georgians long-term financial health. So I urge all my colleagues, and especially my Republican colleagues, those who believe in real conservative fiscal values to reconsider this approach. Rather, let's work together on a bipartisan, responsible tax relief reform that actually benefits hard-working families and keeps Georgians economy strong. Now is not the time for giveaways to the wealthiest among us. Now is a time for real leadership. So let's stand up for the people we were elected to serve and reject House Bill 111. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Jim, on his yield, who's the well? Representative Aronsonia is recognized to speak to the bill. HB111. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, I rise today to speak against House Bill 111. Not because I oppose tax relief for hard-working Georgians, but because this is not a tax credit, it is a tax scam. Given tax break can be beneficial, especially in difficult economic times. But HB111 falls short of that. Yes, Georgians deserve relief, especially as people struggle with the rising cost. It is no secret that the cost of living has gone up since January 20th, with these misguided tariffs on imported goods. And our solution is to hand out tax break to corporations and wealthy people. We shouldn't need any more money by now. And we leave many Georgians behind suffering. At the time where rural hospitals are closing down and our schools are under fund ed, an inflation continues to head towards the ceiling. And this body solution is to hand 500 million to the wealthiest 20%. While the average Georgian sees just $70 per year. As I mentioned, I imagine this can probably be beneficial for me in some ways. But I didn't come here to reach my own pocket. I ran for office to stand for and stand with the ordinary people. The leadership is a privilege to better the life of others. It is not an opportunity for you to satisfy your own personal greed. Two weeks ago, we passed House Bill 223 to give tax credit to certain timber producers. While I supported it as my vote indicates. And this chamber supported it in a strong bipartisan fashion. I must be completely honest with you all. It is a shame. It is a shame when you look at the unspoken design of that bill, you will observe that many members of this chamber, high ranking members too, are the ones who will hijack those tax credit. Because many of them are timber farmers. They export timber, paint of farmers and other agricultural products. It is a shame. We must also consider the long term risk. If revenue declines or we fail to grow at the expected rate, Georgia could face budget shortfalls. And that might lead to future tax hikes or cuts to essential services. I mean, it is no secret. It seems that folks are ready to campaign beginning this summer. And this is what this bill is all about. And so probably talking about what tax cut that gave to who. Look, you have to make a decision if you want to be for public service or you want to be for self-service. And the quick hiding and pretence that you are doing the people's work because you are doing your pocket work. Folks, I don't think anyone here needs any more convincing to vote no one aged 111. In its current form. Let us work toward a smarter and fairer tax policy that truly puts Georgians first. Thank you. I yield. The gentleman is yielded well. Representative Butler is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. I'm going to talk to you from my perspective as a mother. I hope all of you have a child in your life that you've taken to a store sometime. And you've watched them see something in that store. And their eyes just pop wide open and they smile and they're gleeful. And they see something they really, really want. I hope you've had that experience. And I hope that only a few times you were faced with the fact that the item that they want is not appropriate for them. And you had to say no. Or that the item that they wanted. You really didn't have the money for. And you didn't want to tell them and make them feel that they were poor. But you really couldn't afford it. Or for me sometimes the worst is, well, I know I've got the money and savings in like a rainy day fund. But the refrigerator or the car or the stove's been a little fickle lately. And if I buy this now and that breaks, what am I going to do? That's where I feel like we are with this bill. And to me the hardest thing is to say no to someone when they want something and there's anything possible I could do to give it to them. I want to do that. I want to give people things. And right now with the way people are hurting all across our state, I want to give them every chance to have every penny that they can have to buy every egg they want. I want them to have what they need. And things I know and I think you know as well. I know the governor has a goal to lower Georgia's income tax rate to 4.99%. And I assume he feels his term limit clock ticking and wants to check it off and get it done. I know that the money involved with this is just in hundreds of millions of dollars and not billions like we have in the reserves. And I know that citizens need every penny that they can get. They are afraid. They are afraid of the unknown cost. They are afraid of the continuing increase in cost. And they are afraid of what might happen with the federal generated tariffs. I know we don't know what's coming our way. We don't have that crystal ball that tells us what's coming our way. But we do know that we have a budget that relies heavily on federal dollars. Anywhere from 25 to 32% every budget year. And we don't know how much of that money is going to stay somewhere in Washington or come down to us. And I do know the man that sat in the aisle seat there many years ago, Mr. Tom Buck, who was the ways it means chair. And he thought the triple A bond rating of Georgia was the most important thing for us to take care of. Quite honestly on a side conversation, he might say it was more important than Medicaid for kids. But he really felt that that was the way we could have the money that we needed to do those things in the state of Georgia. Bond ratings are critical to our success. Bond ratings that are lower than triple A cost money. To keep bond ratings you have to do several things. You have to have positive employment trends. You have to have strong budget performance. You have to have balanced revenue sources. You have to have the ability to overcome financial and cover your financial obligations. And you have to maintain a reserve. And you have to honor your own statutes. I know we talk sometimes about things being either or. But sometimes choice is an option. And I know that's kind of wording that makes people nervous. But we have a chance today to put real money in the hands of citizens that will probably come up later. And that's representative McDonald's bill, HB12. It is a more fair disbursement of funds. It is not a permanent change in our tax rates. And it is a possibility to help some of the people in our state that need it. In these uncertain times that are evidenced by the recent Atlanta Federal Reserve announcement of 2.8% drop in the GDP for the first quarter. Times are uncertain. I just do not feel this is the time for us to make this rate change. I know we want to be like other states and have a low tax rate. But when you look at those other states with those lower tax rates, have you also looked at their bond rating? Have you also...

looked at their budgets and have you looked at their economy to see how it compares with us. As I had to say far too often to my children, I just can't buy that today. I cannot buy this today. And I do not think we should pass this piece of legislation in these uncertain times. With that Mr. Speaker, I yell the well. And lady has yielded the well. That completes our minority report. We have up to 20 minutes, up to 20 minutes. You don't have to take it all. For the chair's time. First name, Blackman, you're going to share your chairman's time. He's going to defer to Whitbert Shit for the first time. He has to do it this time. Representative Bert Shit has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This started a bit earlier than I thought would today. But I'm going to come in here and try to just refute some of these ideals. Firstly, it's interesting to me that a colleague of mine would come in here and say that we need not give a tax break. We need not give people's money back. We don't want to give them their money because we think that we can spend it better than them. Since when has the state of Georgia or the federal government ever spent my dollars better than I can spend them? I would submit to you that I know what kind of hamburger I like to buy. I know what kind of bananas I like to buy. Oranges. What gasoline I put in my truck. I don't know any state politician or state commissioner that can tell me that I can spend my money better than I can. This ideal that we do better a better job of spending our Georgia's money than they do is preposterous. It is crazy. It is nuts. I can't understand for the life of me how the party of the people can come in here and say that we don't want to give you your money back. We want your money because we know better than you. How in the world do we do that folks? That is just nuts. To me, my perspective is that anytime anybody earns a dollar, some parties want to take more of that dollar to offer to other people. I don't understand that. I just I wasn't raised that way. I suppose if I earn a dollar, I want to spend my money. I want to buy stuff for my kids. I want to buy stuff for my family. But to say that an entity other than me can spend my money better than me is totally nuts and I can't figure it out. One of my colleagues said this gives a break to the most wealthy, the wealthiest folks in this chamber. I wish that that graphic was still up there but without sounding condescending and I don't want to be disrespectful. But this is a percentage rate. The way percentages work is applied to amount and it takes the same percentage of that amount away from our folks. So this income tax is a percentage rate of what you earn. So of course you take more from someone that makes more and you give back more to someone that makes more. But I would submit to you. Someone got this well and said that $70 is not enough. $70 is not a lot. But I can tell you to a working single mother with two kids, $70 buys a dinner. Maybe two nights in a row. That buys dinner two nights in a row. But my colleagues think that's a bad idea. You think that's a bad idea? It's a bad idea for a single mother to buy dinner for her kids. How is that a bad idea for instance? I don't get it. I just don't get it. One of my colleagues said that these other states have no income tax and have you looked at their bond rating. But one of them is Florida, zero income tax, triple A bond rating. You guys look it up. Google took me five seconds to figure that out. Show me in this bill anywhere. Show me in this bill where this tax break gives a break to the wealthy and doesn't give it to the lowest income earners in this state. Point to the words, points to the lines. Show me where that is. I will help you strike it because that is not what's happened here. It is terrible for someone to come in here and characterize this bill as giving tax breaks to the most wealthy and not giving them to the lowest earners in this state. That is a terrible mischaracterization. It's a downright life, folks. It is a lie. It is a percentage. Point to 0.02% is what we're cutting for everybody in this state regardless of what you make from the lowest earners to the highest earners. It's the most fair way to apply taxes. I would really appreciate it if we would just characterize for what it is. For whatever reason, a party has taken a position to not give tax breaks. If you think you can spend Georgians money better than they can, then I welcome you to make that case in November. But that I'm going to yield back to the chairman. The gentleman is yielded the will. The chairman of the committee. Chairman Blackman is recognized to speak to the bill for the remainder of the time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be brief. We've got a long day. But again, the very same legislation that provided for this rate reduction also took many off the tax rolls altogether. And more than double the standard deduction, providing along with last year's dependent deduction increase that a family of four now pays zero tax on their first $32,000 of income. That means a family of four that brings in $32,000 of income has an effective rate of zero. This measure again to reinforce the Whips point allows Georgians to keep more of their money, not the government's money, their money, and reduces the tax burden for every Georgian, for every Georgian family that pays taxes. So let's join in sending a message that we trust hard work in Georgians to spend their money better than does the government. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. The gentleman is yielded the will. That concludes those, I guess, the measure and those in favor. Is there any objection to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report the committee has agreed to. All this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 111, the yeas are 110, the nays are 60. This bill, however you see, the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 112, 112? House Bill 112, by the way, I have a final third of the 26 to be in total the knack to amend chapter 7 and title 48 of the fiscal to Georgian and Tate relayed an income taxes to survive for one time tax credit. For individual taxpayers who file income tax returns for the 2023 and 2024 taxable years, this bill has referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass. The representative Lauren McDonald is recognized to present the bill, representative McDonald. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh-oh. But things flew off again. Thank you. Pardon me. There we go. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I want to first, I want to thank my eight block friends over here. They returned my file right before I came up here. I appreciate you all getting the bill back that I have to present. So who needs friends when you got the blog guys over here. I bring this bill on behalf of the administration. This is not a bill that we haven't heard before a few years ago. HB1, 12 is a one time tax credit for those that have filed their 2023 and 2024 taxes. The amount that the under there, the taxes that they filed for joint files will get back 500 for head of household will get back $375 for individual files. You'll get back $250. Mr. Speaker, are you for any questions? The gentleman has a question down front. Representations recommends requests. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that House bill 112 is a reflection of the strong fiscal policy that management, the state has had that is resulted in economic growth and reflects our commitment to limited government? Yes, sir, Mr. Leader. With this and other legislation we passed over the past two years, this commitment that each of us in this House is given to hard work in Georgians will equal up to about $7.6 billion that y'all have given back to these Georgians. It's a big commitment that each of everyone who got made to Georgians. The gentleman you have one more question from width part to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? Yes. Is it not true that I look forward to voting yes to this bill that provides fair tax cuts of 250, 375 and 500 to all Georgians, unlike the last bill which again per the map, resulted in unfair distribution of taxes? I want to thank you for your support and also the the pre-vote of support that my friend from Columbus gave in her presentation on the last bill. Gentlemen, has there further questions? I yield well. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none the report of the committee has agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted what represent the park can arise? She waits. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 112, the A's are 175, the NA's are 0. This bill ever see the record is there for a pass. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 159? House Bill 159 by Representative Crow, the 118th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 26 of Title 50, the fiscal to Georgia, the fiscal to Georgia, the anti-tether related and Georgia housing and finance authority. So it's the increase the outstanding bond limit. This bill I'm referring to the committee on budget and fiscal affairs oversight that bill that committee recommends a dis bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Crow has recognized chairman Crow to present the bill. House Bill 159. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, House Bill 159 is a bill that would increase the aggregate amount of mortgage revenue bonds that the Georgia housing and finance authority can issue each year. There's that story to cap to currently at $3 billion that would double that cap to $6 billion. These funds and the mortgage revenue bonds are used to support their Georgia Dream home financing program. They originate loans for low income, first time home buyers, a lot of public safety, first responders, school teachers. It's a great program and this would allow them to continue to issue those bonds and keep that program funded so they can issue more mortgages. And I'll stay for any questions, Mr. Speaker. And gentlemen, has one question, Representative Washburn to your left, recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does Chairman Hill? Absolutely. Is it not true that I appreciate you bringing this bill? This is an important bill for entry level housing in Georgia, which we have a great shortage right now. It is and thank you very much for your support on this bill. General has no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the well and asked for your favorable consideration? General, as you were the well, is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report of the committee is agreed to shall. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I'm going to go on. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Williamson Ross? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that there is no obligation to the taxpayers of the state of Georgia by increasing this? There is no financial obligation to the state. Is that not true? I know that gentleman has learned it on this subject matter, and I believe he knows what he speaks, and I believe he's accurate. Have all members now voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 159, the yeas are 162, the nays are 10. This bill, however, is either requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 185? The House Bill 185, a repson of Earnhardt of the 36th and others to be entitled to enact to amend Title 43, the fiscal to Georgia and TATA related professions and businesses, so as a repeal and reenact Chapter 11A, the Dietetics Practice Act. This bill then refer to the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The lady from Cobb County, a representative, Ginny Earhardt is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Speaker and members of the House, the Georgia Dietetics Act has not been updated in 30 years, so HB 185 serves to take care of that. What it does is it streamlines and narrows the requirements and the definitions to be licensed as a dietician and a nutritionist in Georgia. Most importantly, it makes a big distinction between general nutrition advice, like something that might be given to our children on their sports teams or a personal trainer or a coach, makes a distinguish between that and medical nutrition therapy, which is often given in the treatment of a disease or disorder or a condition. That requires a much higher level of training. So the bill serves to streamline that, clarify that language. It also permits Georgia to join an Interstate Compact for licensed dieticians. We would be one of the first states in the Compact. I learned that there is an advantage to being one of the first seven states and that it allows you or would give Georgia a seat at the table and setting those requirements for the pact and the requirements for those dieticians that move in and out of the state. It's a good bill very much needed to fix some outdated language. Mr. Speaker, that is it and I will yield the well unless there are any questions. Lady has no questions. Lady has no questions. No questions. Thank you. I'm sorry. I said that real quick. Sorry about that. Lady has no question. She's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the Committee has agreed to shout this bill. Now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, were you in lock the machine? Have all members voted? If so. Have all members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked in the machine? On the pass to House Bill 185, the yeas are 171, the nays are two. This bill, Henry C. The Request Cost of Social Majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption to House Bill 485, 485? House Bill 485, I represent a year to the 150 second and others to be entitled, not to amend. The official code of Georgia annotated so is to repeal various provisions enacted prior to 2013, which are contingent upon funding, in which remain unfunded. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Code Revision. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Mr. Clerk, was it the bill or your to is recognized to present the bill or representative your to? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 485 is not the annual code revision bill, which will come later this session. That's actually a Senate bill this year. But this bill does the same function or similar functions. This bill streamlines and modernizes terminology, as well as some of the federal references in the Georgia law. For example, references to like no child left behind act has since been renamed every student's seat's act. Suck it, the bill repeals provisions contingent upon funding that have remained unfunded since 2013, one of which has been unfunded since 1983. Finally, the bill repeals unconstitutional portions of a number of laws with language in this bill reflecting the reenacted constitutional portions of these laws. Any constitutional portion of law that requires further debate, of course, will be policy discussions of this General Assembly were not included in this bill. I want to thank the legislative council for working hard on this and house budget and research for their assistance and would let ask for your favourable consideration. Gentlemen, the gentleman has no questions. Thank you. I yield well, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, as you the well, is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the pass to the bill? Here in none, the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass on in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members have voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 485, the days are 175, the days are zero. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. It's therefore adopted. Members, if you have pages today, we're going to break for lunch and recess for lunch. We're going to ask you to come down and join your pages. Members, before you move around too much, I want to ask you to remember a former member of this House, Chairman Bill Himbrie, who many of you served with, he was chairman of rules. The bill is not doing well, so I'll ask you to keep him and his family in your prayers. Bill Himbrie, who remains in the House District 67 at that time, a good man, a good friend. So, keep him in your prayers, if you will. We'll break until 1.30 p.m. we'll be in recess. This House will stay in recess until 1. Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk. Don't leave yet. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Honoring the life and memory of Bobby C. Pate, Honoring the life and memory of Larry Max Cox, commending William L.
