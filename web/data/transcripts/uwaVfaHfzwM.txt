TRANSCRIPT
----------
Mr. Clerk, how about ring the bell, let's get our folks in.
here and we could get started on our next house bill. Pretty important when if you're
anybody else?
All right. All members, please come into the chamber. All members come into the chamber
and look for your seat. This would be the appropriate time to do all of that.
day is this. Day 40. Day 40. There you go. That's what day it is. Day 4-0.
Thank you members, hope you had a good lunch, nobody needs to take a nap.
I've got some important business to take care of this afternoon.
So with that, I'm going to recognize Representative Matt Hatchett for a motion, Chairman Hatchett.
Mr. Speaker, I move that this House agreed to the conference committee report for House
Bill 68.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to the conference committee report?
The committee of conference on House Bill 68 recommends both the House of Representatives
and the Senate recede from their positions
and that the Attach Committee of Conference Substitute
to House Bill 68 be adopted, respectfully submitted,
Honorable Matt Hatchett, representative of 155th District,
Honorable Jan Jones, representative 47th District,
Honorable Chuck Hestration, representative 104th District,
for the Senate, Honorable Blake Tillery, Senator,
19th District, Honorable John F. Kennedy, Senator,
18th District and the Honourable Stephen Gooch, Senator 51st District.
The gentleman is recognized to explain the conference committee reporting.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Before I call Tyrone, I'd like to take a moment of it.
The gentleman will suspend.
I don't know anything about each Tyrone.
I thought I'd just loosen things up here in a little bit.
The best be careful, though, time runs, I'm gonna tell you.
Okay, the gentleman's recognized.
Thank you.
I'd like to take a moment of personal privilege and introduce three pages that I have today.
Two of my pages is their third and second year for doing that.
doing that, and they happen to be the children of our budget office, the director, Christine
Murdoch, their, her children Maya and Miles Murdoch stand up.
How about that?
I'm sure they'll get me back for that one day.
the other is Miss Danica Risha. She's from Millageville, but her mother grew up in Dublin
and moved to Millageville for some reason. But she has been paging for us at least once
and on several sunny days, but this is her seventh year paging, Danica Stanhope.
Thank you.
Y'all, it's been a journey to get to this point on the FY26 budget, but we have arrived.
And I believe that we worked with our partners in the Senate and the Governor's Office to
The craft of budget for the next fiscal year that both makes the needs of Georgians and
lives within our means.
Based on interest earnings at Treasury to date, the governor has increased the revenue
estimate this morning by $50.4 million.
This additional recognition of revenue helped us close gaps in the budget where the general
assembly sought to ensure that the base was correct for programs with higher than anticipated
utilization, like out-of-home care in DHS.
It also allowed the General Assembly to maintain its additional support for enhancements in
corrections and education.
As I told you in the budget left this house, the budget is highly focused on public safety
and education.
That position still holds in the conference committee version.
There are a number of items that you won't see on your
differences sheet because the Senate agreed with the House
position, like $22.7 million, including $10 million in
newly appropriated funds for recommendations by the Georgia
Council on Literacy and adds in corrections for new
correctional officer positions in state prisons and
technology upgrades.
There were a number of differences between the House and the
Senate that did not have to be resolved.
Decisions like whether or not to utilize bonds
or fully fund the promised scholarship
were never policy differences with the governor or the Senate.
Rather, they were simply different strategies
employed to balance the budget.
Here are a few highlights of differences in the budget.
As I left this chamber, and as the conference committee
has recommended them. The House agreed with the Senate and the governor to utilize cash
for one more year to find capital projects. There are no bonds in the final version of
the budget. The conference committee returns to the governor's position of funding the
promise scholarship at 1% of QBE earnings or $141 million. I know many of you have been
receiving updates on the number of applications and know that of the 10,000
applications started, 5,100 have been deemed eligible for the scholarship
today and that's as of today. This full funding allows for more than 21,000
students the opportunity to participate in the program. We spent a lot of time
perfecting the school safety legislation, funding for the S3 database that was
included in the House version of the budget has been removed and the
conference committee version includes $6.9 million for reimbursable grants
for qualified student advocacy specialists as authorized in House Bill
268. I've heard from many of you who were concerned about apex. The Senate
had moved the funding for APEX to the Department of Education for Mental Health Services.
We understand that that funding mechanism would not have worked to continue the successful
program.
So in the conference committee version, $9.2 million in APEX funding is restored to DBHCD.
Funding for the new student support services program at DOE is preserved.
I'll be at it a slightly lower number, this includes nearly $20 million for mental health support grants for middle and high schools, and $2.3 million to provide funds for school systems that, due to their size, do not earn full funding for a school social worker, the Senate added to the out of school care grants or boost 2.0, bringing the total to $12.5 million.
Finally, one of the items that I'm most proud of in this budget is the poverty weight.
It's funded at $15.2 million.
These funds will impact more than 94,000 students in 59 school systems with more than 40%
of their students meeting direct certification poverty criteria.
In health care, we were able to make a number of improvements to medical rate, Medicaid rates.
Ultimately, we were not able to include all the adjustments requested, but adjustments
were made for primary care physicians, dental codes, applied behavior analysts, neonatologists
and maternal fetal medicine, and to provide AMS reimbursements upon patient pickup.
The federal Georgia is always on our mind to help address health care needs.
The House and Senate have provided $3.9 million to expand the newborn add-on payment for
Medicaid delivery services in rural Georgia.
These funds will provide a $2,000 add-on payment for a total of $3,000 per delivery in rural
counties with a population of less than 35,000.
And in rural counties with a population between 35,000 and 50,000, there will be a $1,500
add-on payment.
While the amended budget was the vehicle for Hurricane Helene relief, this budget includes
other item tied to HB 223 which is $17.3 million for a grant for local governments to provide
reimbursements for timber severance taxes not collected. In the Department of Agriculture,
a number of reductions from the Senate version have been restored including an emergency management
specialist position and two meat inspector positions. The Senate also agreed to set up a
fun with the Forestry Commission to provide speedier overtime payments to our
forestland firefighters who are frontline responders when natural disasters
occur across our country. This was an important priority for many of you. Also
important to a number of you was maintaining the 2% provider rate increase for
child-caring institutions, child-placing agencies, foster parents and
relative caregivers. These agencies and people are meeting a need for our state and the
youth in their care and it was important to recognize the increased cost they're incurring.
The House has added to the Governor's recommendation for the now comp waivers and the Senate
agreed to the House position to find a total of 115 new slides.
In the conference committee version of the budget, the Department of Correction receives
an infusion of $200 million over the current budget.
This is $75 million more than the Governor's original recommendations, but the House and
the Senate agree on staffing and safety increases.
However, the House went further and wanted to recognize the increased costs for food
and health care in the base budget, but ultimately, we recognize that some of these additions
are multi-year process and can be adjusted next year.
The commissioner has been a good partner and we appreciate it and he always picked up
the phone whenever we needed to just call Tyrone.
Finally, gentlemen's out of order.
Boosting the financial stability of the Employees Retirement System has been a priority
of many in this chamber, and we worked hard in the budget over several years to boost
the long-term outlook of the system, while also addressing the needs of state retirees
who gave service to our state.
While not as high as initially recommended by the House, the conference committee version
of the budget includes an additional $10 million to ERS to increase the one-time supplement
payment that retirees receive.
Mr. Speaker, that's a very high-level review of the most significant changes in the budget
since it left this chamber first.
This document and the accompanying highlights have been on your desk since about 1040 this
morning.
I appreciate the opportunity to work on this budget on behalf of you and the citizens
of this state.
I want to thank our colleagues in the Senate, Rick Dunn and Lauren Curry in the Governor's
office, the subcommittee chairs, and the greatest budget staff in the country.
For all of their hours they put in to get this document for you to this place.
Before I go call Tyrone again, I'll take some questions.
I've got to gather myself after you call Tyrone.
Gentlemen's going to yield for some questions, and I-
Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker.
This recognizes Representative Barry to your left about two-thirds of the way back.
on the left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman you?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that this budget increases the hope equalization grant for our HBCUs, which
is a crucial benefit for our HBCUs students, but there is still not further true to do more
for full hope parity for our HBCUs students in the state?
I believe that is correct.
Thank you for this bill.
Representative Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman you?
Yes.
I'm using the tracking sheet for this, on 145.7.
When it's talking about the voucher program,
it references SB 82, which I believe is a bill
that we just passed that compels local school systems
to not deny the charter school petitions.
And in that bill we said the state will give you $250,000
and start up costs.
It looks like the only appropriated $500,000.
And that's $145.7, correct?
Yeah.
We did appropriate $500,000.
This is a grant program as we do in many items
through the budget.
You never know how many will apply.
So this allows if we do have two that apply between now
I'm saying I'm inded we do have the money to do what we have said we would do in the bill right but if we have three
Then they would not get the 250 it'll be divided by three instead of two no we will they will be funded at 250
They just might have to wait a little while. Thank you
Representive you looked into your left is recognize for a question
Thank you does the gentleman yield yes
Thank you for working so hard on our budget.
Is it not true that on 228.4, line 228.4, we have although I am a little disappointed
that we did not end up with the 8.1 million to fund for the fall off of the victims
of crime act money, we have settled on $3.1 million to give to victims of crime, sexual
salt centers, things like that, which is more than the governor's recommendation.
Is that right?
That is true.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
It is, you know, I think this is something that we need to all remember and consider from
now on that, you know, we are the state and we cannot, cannot replace all federal funds
if they go away, so we have helped them and propped them up for a little while.
For everything that's stints and in the back to your left, recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with a gentleman yield?
Yes, to my favorite strawberry queen.
Thank you.
Is it not true that my seatmate standing with me wanted to say that she really appreciate
you calling Tyrone, but you can't use her phone, is that not true?
I believe I've heard that before.
I won't say the rest of the song. I might get thrown out of here.
We thank you for your work on the budget. Thank you.
Mr. Speaker. Representative Holcomb has a question.
Mr. Chairman, if you'll take his question, then you have.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
this gentleman yield yes our budget is predicated on a revenue estimate and I
think it's fair to say that since we reconvened in January the macro
economic picture has changed pretty dramatically and just over the last few
days the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates that were likely to see a negative
drop of 2.8% and GDP for this quarter and JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both
state that the probability of a recession now is quite high because of the
recently imposed tariffs which represent the largest tax increase since 1968.
So my question is how comfortable are you with the probability that the
revenue estimates that make this budget will hold throughout the year?
Well, I'm not an economist and I don't play one on TV, but you are correct, I believe
that things have changed and are changing.
I would think that this, I would think this budget could stand.
there are huge slings then you know our role is this is our number one job and I
don't think anybody in here would have we could not object to coming back and
correcting something that all of a sudden unforeseen by us we have to correct
thank you
Mr. Speaker with that I would ask for the body's favorable consideration and I
You're the well the gentleman's you to the well. Are you suggesting that I should call Tyrone?
Okay, use your phone. I don't have his number so we'll move on from that one

Parliamentary inquiry.
Is it not true that on today the commemoration of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. this budget includes a cut to the King's Center?
Yes, I think I saw that line and I know that Chairman was, it worked diligently to maintain
those numbers and I think he's going to share some light on that for us, so for what purpose
does Chairman Hatchett rise?
Parliamentary inquiry.
Mr. Speaker, is it not true that that particular line item for the Martin Luther King Center
There's a 125 increase to a line on it that approaches a million dollars a year.
I'm sure the gentleman has washed out over the years and has embedded in our budget.
And we're continuing to support.
An institution is important to our state and our country.
For what purpose is represented the race prize?
Mr. Speaker, parliamentary, agree.
Mr. Speaker, is it true, I'm not sure if I'm asking you, is it true that the budget chair

Fort Purpose Reflective Barnes rise.
Parliamentary inquiry, thank you.
State inquiry.
Is it not true that based on the budget, there is a reduction in nutrition funds, but only because as many kids as we fed last year does not need to be fed this year.

close to his heart and his mind to share it as it will. This house as well. Have all members

What the amendment you have on your desk does is it removes any existing language from House
bill 370 and adds in the vape registry bill that this house passed in house bill 570 7159 to 12 earlier this session
It's exactly the same as what we have already considered in this body and we'll speak. I'm happy to answer a question if there is one

Representative Allen
The back to your left right now. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? I do
Isn't it true that this substitute that's on this bill now is being pushed by the tobacco
lobby in an effort to create a monopoly on the sale of vaping products?
No, and in fact, I'll tell you just two days ago, the Supreme Court ruled on this matter
and made it clear that whether FDA is done to try to regulate vaping, the FDA's active
properly.
Instead, what this is trying to do is, again, under control, the massive influx of illegal
disposable Chinese vape products and my hope is this house will once again overwhelmingly approve this bill

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
HB 491 passed the House last week, actually 171 to 2.

Senate bill 1-0 by Senator Goodman of the 8th and others to be titled an act to amend Code section 15-6-2 with the official code of Georgia annotated relating to the number of judges and superior courts
So it's a revive for an additional judge of the Spirit of Courts, the Lapa Ha, Judicial Circuit.
I spill them for the Committee on Judiciary.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by a Rules Committee substitute.
Representative Tray Kelly is recognized to present Senate Bill 10.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues.
I bring before you SBTN, which was originally a bill that was going to add a new judge to the Lapa Ha Circuit.
That measure was already passed by Representative Ford,
and so it will no longer be needed.
And so we use it as a vehicle for judicial officers
in circuits to have over 15 superior court judges
to help improve efficiency throughout the process.
Mr. Speaker, it's a simple bill passed
the Judiciary Committee unanimously
with bipartisan support.
I would ask for your favorable consideration.
I'd probably glad to take your questions.
General, I have no questions.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
You'll be well.

Mr. Clerk, will you be decaptioned to House Resolution 347?
House Resolution 347.
A resolution urging all high schools to establish flag football programs for girls.
This resolution haven't been assigned to the committee on special rules.
Committee recommends that this resolution be adopted.
Representative Brent Cox has recognized to present the House resolution 347.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I come to you as an urging resolution from this body that we encourage all Georgia
high school athletic programs in this state to start girls flag football.
The day we dropped this resolution, we have since had 34 high schools start participating
in creating their new girls high school football.
Currently there's 457 schools in GHSA, 307 of which are currently participating, over
9,000 girls.
In 1972 is when Title IX occurred, and that was the origin of when Flag Football began
in this country.
This has gained some great recognition.
If you'll look up on the board, the Author Blank Foundation and the Atlanta Falcons
Currently, you're offering a grant and I encourage any one of you,
we have 150 high schools left to get programs going.
And you can QR code and you can get that information and get it back to your high schools.
But they're offering five to $10,000 grants to each school to help them start it.
Y'all coming up in Los Angeles is the Olympics.
They're going to be offering Flag Football.
This is an incredible opportunity for our high school students to potentially become
future Olympians.
The Falcons, the NFL, all are fully behind in supporting this.
Our local sports broadcasters are fully behind this.
We will be the first legislators across the country to do this.
So I ask for your favorable support and strongly encourage you, let's get 100% support across
this state.
Mr. Speaker, I yield for any questions.
You have several representative Wilkerson to your left and the back is recognized for
a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Is the gentleman yield?
Yes, I do.
Is it not true that the McKeecher and High School Indians flag football team is one of
the top ranked teams in the state?
Actually the nation and they are state jabbies. Is that not true my friend? I do believe you're 100% correct
To your left representative Jasmine Clark is recognized for a question. Thank you mr. Speaker does a gentleman you?
Yes, I do is it not true that I love
Watching our girls play flag football and while we are urging schools
I would also urge us to consider how much it cost to actually have
have these types of sports at schools and hopefully we can get funding so that we can help these schools start these five football programs.
I understand and that's where author Blank and his foundation has poured into our community to do such things as that through private money.
And I urge you to create resolutions to move forward with it as well.
Representative Scofield is recognized for a question to your right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, I do.
I really like this program, and I clicked on the link.
And is it not true that you said that they're looking for more ways for other schools to engage?
Or more funding?
May I miss something?
We're looking for the remaining 150, at least in GHSA, to finish out and starting their programs.
their programs and that they can use this grant money to help start their programs.
There's currently 307.
Okay, because I'm looking at the form right now and it says, thanks for your interest,
but it's closed.
We're no longer accepting new submissions.
It's on the right side.
I clicked on the link.
I will check and see, but right now I know that the author blank foundation and the Atlanta
Falcons are fully behind us.
All right.
Thanks.
So, ladies and gentlemen, I had conversation with GHS yesterday and they were wide open.
looking and then the blank Atlanta Falcons are certainly behind it.

Thank you gentlemen had new further questions. He's
Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I rise today in strong support of Senate Bill 101 as substituted
by the health committee on public and community health.
This legislation addresses a fundamental issue
of equity, access and dignity in our healthcare system.
Senate Bill 101 ensures that Georgians
who rely on orthotic and prosthetic devices
can live a full independent lives,
maximize their rehabilitation,
maximize their functional capacity.
Let me be clear, these devices are not luxuries.
They are not cosmetic.
They are medically necessary for function.
We are talking about artificial limbs, custom designs,
supports, and mobility aids that enable our fellow citizens
to walk, work, play, bathe, care for their families,
and anything that you do, they will be able to do.
And yet, too often coverage for these essential devices
is either denied or limited by outdated policies
that don't reflect the real needs of the people
that we serve, Senate Bill 101, changes that.
It requires health benefit policies in Georgia
to provide coverage for orthotic and prosthetic devices
when they are medically necessary.
It ensures this coverage supports not just survival,
but quality of life, covering devices
that enable physical activity, personal hygiene
and essential job functions.
This bill, colleagues, brings Georgia in line
with national clinical standards.
It recognizes that a joint may need to be replaced
when a person's body changes, and that a limb may need
more than one device over a period of time
and at any one time.
It includes not just the device itself,
but the education, the training, the fittings,
and the repairs, everything a person needs to be effective
in their mobility.
Importantly, Senate Bill 101 sets reasonable limits,
no more than three devices per limb over three years.
And it allows insurers to deny coverage
for misuse or theft.
This is a balanced approach.
And to my colleagues concerned about cost, I hear you.
But consider this, restoring mobility reduces long-term health care expenses.
It reduces secondary conditions, prevents hospitalizations and increases employment and mobility ability.
It empowers Georgia's to live to their full capacity.
And colleagues, I ask that the members of this body do vote in favor of Senate Bill 101.
because today we have a chance to say we see you, we value you, and we are not going to let insurance company stand in the way of our rights to live a full and healthy life.
I urge your favor consideration, and I respectfully ask for your yes vote on Senate Bill 101.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the will.
Nice job, the lady is yielded the well.
That concludes the speakers on the bill.
If we do have a minority report, is there any objection
to the previous question being ordered?
Hearing none, the previous question is ordered.
We do have a minority report.
Representing part canons recognize for up to 20 minutes
for the minority report.
I don't need that, I love you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, members.
I want to be very clear this minority report
is not about the substance of what this bill does
for our communities that need this health benefit.
This minority report is specifically
about an efficient government and a process
to understand what happens once we do this.
Walk with me through this.
Any plan starting in 2026?
Private plans in the state of Georgia must provide this.
access. So, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030. So, that's a set of five years of data.
On line 112, it speaks to those five years. So, thank you in the bill for speaking directly
about what we want this report to include.
But online 105, it says that the report is not due
until July 1st, 2032.
The questions that we asked in committee was,
if this is such an important piece of legislation
that so many of us agree with,
why would we request that a department give us a report
two and a half years later?
So again, we're hopeful that there will be some work on this legislation to bring that report sooner and to make sure that those who are receiving this health care benefit have timely processing.
We want to thank those who have publicly stated that they will continue to work to get the state health benefit plan to also participate in this as currently this measure does not include it.
And that's all that we have.
I will be voting in favor of this measure,
but wanted to be clear that this minority report is about process
and making our government more efficient
with the number of claims submitted,
the number of claims paid,
and the total amount that it costs for our state.
Thank you, and I yield.
That concludes the speakers on the minority report.
The lady is yielded the well, we don't have anyone taking this chairman's time so we're
going to move on.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Here in the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Here in the report of the committee's agreed to, shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill?
We'll vote yes.
All those opposed.
We'll vote no.

I have all members voted.
All members voted.
If so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine?
On the passage of Senate Bill 101, the A's are 167, the NA's are two.
Bill Henry see the records of constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 204, 204?
Mr. Clerk, will you suspend just for a moment?
I want to recognize a former member of this house who has had a distinguished career in this legislature and
state government, my friend J. Neill, let's welcome J. Neill to the people's
house back, former member J. Neill.
Mr. Clerk, will you apologize, Mr. Clerk? Will you read the caption, Senate Bill 204204?
Senate Bill 204 by Senator Jones, the 22nd to be entitled back to a men code
section 1777.1 of the official go to George annotated relating to trial upon
on accusations in certain felony and misdemeanor cases,
and trial upon plea of guilty or no-one contender.
This bill ever referred to the Committee
on Judiciary Non-Several Act Committee
recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chairman Ellen Powell was recognized to present Senate Bill 204.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, the House.
I bring to you this afternoon Senate Bill 204, there's two sections of this bill which
normally is the things that we see in the latter days that we combine bills, so I bring
these to you today.
First section that you'll be looking at is reinforcing the preemption clauses that this
general assembly has passed over the years about what those parts of the state law are
that it's important.
Now I would tell you right now that this is a reinforcement because it raises penalties
for those cities and counties and political subdivisions that may violate the preemption
clause to the weapons law in this state.
A lot of people want to talk about that this is about the Second Amendment rights of people.
This is more about keeping order in the administration of the laws in this state.
And I'll tell you a little bit about why this was brought over in the Senate.
Apparently, we have one of the cities in the state that decided to pass a local ordinance
That said that if you have a car
And I'm not sure quite frankly if it was a car that was broken to whether it was locked around a lot
And if somebody stole your weapon, then they charge a thousand dollar fine
If you didn't report it within 24 hours, they charge just secondary thousand dollar fine
If you didn't pay that, then it's a 30-day penalty of incarceration.
And it sounds like this may be a second amendment issue, but there's a bigger issue, and that
is the preemption status of state laws.
I will tell you, if you can imagine it, we have 600-plus political subdivisions in Georgia,
these counties, towns, and if all of these cities and counties preempted state law, then
we would live in a chaotic situation, ladies and gentlemen.
So first and foremost, that's what this is really about.
Yes, there's somewhat to the Second Amendment rights because that seems to be one of the
biggest issues that people want to talk about, but the bigger issue to me is the preemption.
And I know a little bit about preemption, when I was a younger legislator, there was
a legislator by the name of, well, he made one his name mentioned, but he and I passed
the preemption law back in the mid-90s.
And that preemption law said that if there was a violation, it was a $100 fine.
Now I can only tell you what I've been told, they've put these $1,000 fines on there, and
And then it was reached out to the attorney general to reach out to this particular city.
And what came back was that we are getting the $1,000 penalty on these $100 find that
mean anything.
Well, at that time, we thought a 30 something years ago, we thought that $100 might have
been a lot of money at that time, but apparently not $100 in and $100 today isn't much reason
for these cities to bring up the state law.
So what we're doing today is what you see in front of you,
and I'll go over the part section one first.
What we're saying is that if you have been subject to
or grieved by an act, rule, or regulation,
that you have a right to appeal to the courts.
And if you're the prevailing plaintiff in that,
then you can get injunctive relief.
Then there's a civil action which you can recover attorney's fees.
It goes further to say that then we reduced it from the 50,000 penalty that came out of the Senate to 25,000.
But actual damages, if you have actual damages, or whichever is greater plus expenses of litigation and
reasonable attorneys fees, then you can collect or you can claim for liquidated damages or
three times the amount of expenses.
That is a message to send back that preemption.
We are the legislature.
We are the state government.
And we are the ones who write these laws,
because if not, there would be absolute chaos.
And if you went through 600 different political subdivisions
and all of them had a different law,
we would be embroiled in more conflicts
than you can imagine.
Second part of the bill, ladies and gentlemen,
This deals with the criminal procedures with district attorneys.
And if these are offenses that are not considered of serious
violent felonies, such as sexual felonies, violent felonies,
if these are what they call minor felonies,
then they can be prosecuted under an accusation
with that grand jury appearance.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is what this bill does.
I would implore you to consider it.
I know that those people who have concerns, whatever they may be, about the second amendment.
I would tell you that you're about it the right way and do allow the State of Georgia and
the legislature to preempt and let our laws prevail.
That ladies and gentlemen has suggested this bill and I'll be more than glad to stand
for any questions, Mr. Speaker.
Gentleman has several questions, representative Isle,
and she's in the back to your left.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, does the gentleman yield him?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, so so far this session, the majority party has,
number one, refused to grant a hearing to HB1,
a safe storage requirement.
Number two, it's allowed HP 79, which offered a tax credit for purchase of safe storage equipment to be gutted by the Senate.
And number three, it's now seeks to preempt local governments from enacting public safety measures involving safe storage.
And in fact, exposes them to a $25,000 penalty for such measures.
So the question is, can you explain why the majority body continues to oppose interventions that prevent
untapped by criminals, and would address the number one cause of death of kids and teenagers in this country?
To the good lady, I am not in that position of leadership to say why these individual bills haven't came up.
I think that maybe some of them have been heard.
I don't know what has and has.
I know that Georgia is a strong second amendment state.
We've always believed in the right to bear arms.
Most of us who have been on board of this issue for years,
we promote safety, but that's all in the eyes of the builder.
This particular bill to the lady, if I may.
This particular bill, I talk about the prevention.
One of the things that's disturbing to me is that in this municipality,
I'm talking about, they want to charge $1,000 for somebody who is stolen your property.
$1,000, your motor vehicle in this state has always
been treated under the castle doctrine as the same as your home, the same as your home.
So if your baby vehicle has been violated and someone is stole a weapon from it and you're
going to penalize them for being the victim, lady, that's, ma'am, that's not justice.
That is not justice.
So the other question is a political question that you can only ask yourself why these other
the bills haven't come forward.
There's two houses of the legislature
and let the process work.
One follow-up if I may?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
I'll just note that a safe storage requirement
would prevent against gun theft.
So that is a good thing to talk about as we move forward.
I know you're just one person
and you are not making all the decisions,
but I'll just ask you as the bill sponsor primarily,
would you support giving HB1 the safe storage bill
a hearing and a vote.
Next session.
I would like to see what's in the bill.
I make no commitment on any bill until I read the bill and what I'm voting on.
Okay, it was the first bill filed this year, so you have plenty of time to read it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.
Gentlemen, yield for a question from Representative Chastain to your right.
Mr. Johnny Chastain.
Yes, sir.
Jim was recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Is the gentleman yield?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true this bill protects lawful weapon carriers when their rights are violated by unconstitutional local ordinances?
You're absolutely right
Jim a year for a couple more. Yes, sir. Glad to answer any question on such an important subject
represent to make queen
To your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaks. You see the yes
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am
So, isn't it true that this bill would prevent local lawmakers from passing legislation for gun owners to prevent reckless and negligent storage of firearms to prevent unauthorized access to weapons?
that's find local lawmakers, this says that those local governments can't preempt state law.
You are nearly elected to the legislature of this state to pass laws of importance that affect everybody in the state.
If we had 600 plus jurisdictions that just passed the Mirage of Laws, we would have chaos to no one would know exactly what the rules were of behavior.
Thank you, ma'am.
Representative Jason Ridley to your right,
extreme right, is recognize for a question of
that you've read his name.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Gentlemen, you.
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that this year that we had a house member
that had a safe storage unit in his vehicle,
they broke into his vehicle and then still at then,
four days later, they broke into it again,
and took crowbars and opened up to his safe storage unit
in his vehicle and stole his weapon.
And under the if we didn't pass this in that one city he'd be fined $1,000 even though we had a
site to you I thought you're the exact language in that city I'm referring to whether it's a
whether it's a lot car an online car. But I know that if you leave a weapon in a car
then you're subject to have a theft of that vehicle of that weapon. We know that from experience
that right here in their life, that criminals
were target certain vehicles.
They loved to target trucks, SUVs.
In my tenure up here, I lost a couple of handguns
over the years by driving my truck the time
because criminals, they know what to target.
They're professionals.
They broke into my vehicles, didn't get anything
but my weapons, and I learned better.
I learned to start carrying it in my pocket.
Yes, you heard that right.
And it's something that I don't like to talk about very much, because I've always said
those people who talk so boisterous about care and the weapon, they're the ones that
will be the first victim of a criminal, but everyone has that right to protect themselves,
But you also have a right not to be penalized for being lawful citizen and a criminal taking advantage of you.
Gentlemen, you yield for question.
Certainly.
The review is saying she is, to your right is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that the first four pages of this bill is essentially Senate bill 163 by State Senator Colton Moore?
I think you're right.
Thank you.
And please don't hold that against me.
Representative Williamson,
should I ask for a question to your right?
To your right?
Mr. Speaker, is General Neild?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that the core issue we're addressing here
is of the 600 subdivisions of approximately 600 subdivisions
of state government you've referred to,
that they're not lawmakers.
All they can do is pass ordinances.
In this general assembly, it's not only law-making body in the whole state, is that clear?
You are absolutely right.
The cross section of the conscience of this state is what this body in the lower house,
we're the cross section.
We are the state lawmakers in the laws that we pass, take prominence.
Further question?
Yes, sir.
If it's German yield.
Certainly.
Is it not true that many of these subdivisions have not
figured that out yet?
Is that, and the politicians sitting in those seats
have not figured out the fact that they're not lawmakers?
Is that not true?
You know, we live in a time, we live in a time that
is nothing like I've seen in my lifetime politically.
We have issues that people think that because they can't
get justice over what they perceive as their position in the legislature that they can
do what they want to do.
That's disarray, that's chaos, that's not what governance is supposed to be about.
So what I say is that while the Second Amendment may be the deeper part of this, there's
a bigger part and that's about the preemption of these laws.
I had said, why would a city pass a law to penalize someone who was the victim of a crime?
Folks that gives me heartburn to think about.
So that being said, I know there's a lot of people that want to talk about this and I
know there's a lot especially maybe a partisan divide on your beliefs of the Second Amendment.
But I believe that that is a sacred part of the Constitution.
I've always said that the Constitution in God Almighty gave everybody a right to protect
themselves and their property and their loved ones.
But to me, it's absolutely astonishing to believe that someone could be charged with
a crime and to a thousand dollar fine in a penalty.
Let me tell you something about these things, $1,000 don't mean much to some of you folks
out there, but I tell you who it does mean something to you.
It means a lot to those working folks out there to get charged.
You'll remember a little bill that we were dealing with about the cameras.
There's no recourse to a lot of them.
They just sent the check and paid it.
In this particular case, you get charged with a $1,000 penalty or $2,000 if you don't report
it.
Then they've got to hire a lawyer.
Well, in our society, unfortunately, what the day we live in, that they can break you
one way or they can break you the other.
If you have to hire a lawyer and hire legal counsel to stop something, that's not fair,
ladies and gentlemen.
That's the reason the penalties are in here so that they can be reimbursed for their legal expenses, but somebody's got to pay for those legal expenses first.
Mr. Speaker, if there's no other questions, I'm sure we have plenty of folks who want to speak on and against this bill probably, but I would certainly appreciate your considerations to the argument.
I would ask that you vote against violations of preemption.
I would ask that you vote quite frankly for the base issue that creates this preemption.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will and appreciate your favorable consideration.
General, as you were to the will, he did answer most of his questions and we do have a lot
of speakers on the bill.
have a number of folks signed up to speak opposed to and in favor of chairs going to hope
you'll take four minutes and 30 seconds, but I will give you up to five minutes to speakers
on the bill. You'll have the yellow light at 4.30 and you'll have the red light at 5.
So we're going to hold all of those opposed and in favor, per person, knowing anybody
get excited. I thought you had a minute each. We'll move forward. Representative Crawford,
a Murray Crawford. Virginia is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Crawford.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Now, try to be as briefed within your time allotted. Friends of
the day, I rise in opposition of Senate Bill 204. The bill started off as a bill that
dealt with prosecutorial efficiency and then language was added that would preempt local
governance from trying to do what's right and that is to protect their citizens. As a person
that stands in as well, I know a little bit too much about hijacking of bills. And as you can
imagine, I'm against it. Nonetheless, the speaker performed me and he is completely right that
this is a bill that deals with the Home Room Act and Preemption. Georgia counties of municipalities
right now have the opportunity to draft ordinances, not laws, but ordinances that can protect the
the citizens within their local government.
Those ordinances can only be drafted so long
as it does not preempt what the state government says.
Speaker, before me is right,
that under OCGA 161173,
there is already a preemption of any type of sale, transfer,
purchase, or storage of firearms.
Indicat County, we have tried to draft ordinances
that would allow storage ordinances to be implemented,
but preemption prohibited us from doing that.
And so a lot of counties has tried to work around
how do you save the people's lives in your districts
by creating ordinances that would not be challenged
by preemption.
So the issue that I have is allow people in their counties
to come up with some creative ways
that they can decrease the amount of gunshots,
the amount of deaths that occur inside of their counties
because they have the numbers.
What you see on your screen right now is a story
from the Cap County, the county that I'm from,
where someone was actually murdered.
A teenager was murdered because they were able to get inside
of a safe, get inside of someone's home,
take a gun and use that inside of a fight,
and someone died.
This happens all too often.
I'm gonna give you a few stats.
In 2024, there were approximately 200 deaths
and injuries that occurred with teenagers
that were at least 17 years or younger
because they were either killed again or injured
from accidental discharges when they were able
to get inside of closets, cars,
and they killed themselves or others
because they had access to guns.
There have also been nationwide approximately
15,000 deaths similar in Georgia.
There have been about 2,000.
So we have about 2,000 deaths that occur in this state.
Now, the problem is that those 2,000 deaths that occur in this state are centrally located
into Metro Atlanta area.
The reason why I'm bringing that up is because there are counties in Metro Atlanta area
that are trying to create safe ways for people to have guns.
I am not against the second amendment.
If you have a gun and you are a lawful owner, have your gun.
I don't have a problem with that.
But if Fulton County, Decap County, Clayton County wants to create an ordinance that says,
If you don't want our children to get inside of closets to get inside of cars, take those
guys and commit other crimes, then let the people in the Cap County and Fulton County
are whatever county to come up with creative ways to pass those ordinances.
It should also be noted that this is a bill that is trying to do what really is already
the law.
If you look at, and if you have time and if you're so interested, if you look at an
11th Circuit case, the United States versus gun, no pun intended, but if you look at
the United States versus gun, there was already a law that says that the state can preempt
laws that deal with storage.
So there was already a law for this, so you really don't have to pass this bill.
This is something that is already in the law, so we don't really need to pass something
that is already there, but what this does is that it doubles down on any type of effort
from local governments to create, once again, safeguards and safe rails for ordinances.
If you don't like a gun ordinance and whatever county that you come from and let's say
it's a small county that does not have that type of issue, then my suggestion is go to
your city council, go to your commissioners and tell them that you don't want the bill
or the ordinance rather that would preempt or attempt to preempt gun safety storage.
But if you come from a county like some of us come from where that is a big deal, then
again, let us do something to protect the children.
And that's what I am asking.
I am asking that you oppose Senate Bill 204 because there are,
again, there are areas in this state where we need to be able to create these ordinances.
I am a person from the Cap County that understands the importance of allowing us to have the power of home rule.
And I'm asking that you vote down to O4 so that people who are from areas where this is an issue that happens on a daily basis,
allow us to do what we need to do to protect our children.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, are you the well?
The gentleman's yielding the well.
Reptile to Roberts is recognized, speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
That's not quite evening, I guess.
I would like to start my speeches on guns.
I know you all know I'm opposed to this bill with.
I own a gun and it's stored safely at home.
I am not anti-gun, but I'm wondering how many of you took the time to speak with the
students and staff from at Bellaghi High School?
Students and family members who came to the Capitol while still in mourning.
Last September, two 14-year-olds Mason, Shermerhorn, and Christian and Gula were gunned down
at school, coach Richard Aspenwall and Christina Irami, both teachers, died, protecting their
students. Children ran for cover, parents got the call, no parent should ever receive,
that their child might not come home. The students, staff and families of Appalachee
will carry that trauma of that day for the rest of their lives and they are not alone.
From Metro, Atlanta to rural Georgia, gun violence has become routine.
Just two years ago, Amy St. Pierre was shot and killed at a Medtown doctor's office
right up the way.
Her husband lost his wife and her children lost their mother.
These aren't isolated incidents.
In 2024, an average of 2005, Georgians died by gun, 52% by suicide, 45% by homicide.
yet what have we done? Nothing except expand access to guns. The Appalachee
families have come here again and again asking you to pass common sense safe
storage laws and how do we respond with a bill that precludes safe storage
laws? SB 204 is a slap in the face to those families and for what? To punish
Savannah for trying to prevent gun theft and violence.
All they proposed was a civil penalty if someone left their gun and cured in a car, stolen,
and used in a crime.
Instead of supporting them, this bill blocks local leaders from protecting their communities
and lets private citizens sue local governments for trying.
Let's be clear, we're not just tying the hands of mayors and police chiefs.
We are threatening them with legal and financial punishment.
The hypocrisy here is out astounding,
or earlier this session.
Many of you in this room voted for tort or form,
saying Georgia is a judicial hellhole.
Now you wanna create a new private ride of action
against cities and counties
that are trying to keep people safe.
We haven't even passed the bill
that encourages safe storage and safety training
through a simple text rebate.
Wow.
And don't say that's the Senate's fault.
We all know when House leadership wants to get something done,
it gets done.
So let's be honest, this majority party has prioritized
gun lobbyists over Georgia's children.
You're creating a $25,000 legal threat against local government,
small towns that can't afford the risk.
And you're doing it to support a senator who
disrespected two of our speakers and threatened our House staff.
You're siding with him over grieving families in Barrow County.
If you won't pass safe storage laws, at least don't slap these families in the face with
this political retribution bill.
To those of you supporting SB204 out of concern for the Second Amendment, I understand.
But rights come with responsibilities and our responsibility as lawmakers is to protect
life.
Not just the rights of gun owners, but the lives of the innocent.
The students of Appalachia were just trying to learn.
Their parents were just trying to get through a normal day.
SB204 won't make anyone safer.
It won't stop the next shooting.
It might make it harder to prevent.
We should be passing laws to support safe storage,
background checks, and red flag laws.
Not bills that prioritize lawsuits over lives.
This isn't a theoretical debate.
It is life and death, it's lockdowns, ER visits, funerals,
it's trauma children carry into adulthood,
dreams ended by a single bullet.
We cannot keep expanding gun rights
while ignoring gun deaths.
So today I'm not just asking, I've done it before, I begged,
and I'm begging again.
Vote no on SB204 for Appalachie,
for your communities, for your conscience, thank you.
I yield the well.
Thank you, the lady is yielded the well.
Representative Barry is recognized to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today in the strongest opposition to SB204.
I would love to support the original version of SB204
in a bipartisan measure that would reduce
recidivism rates in our state, but instead,
here we are debating another big government control bill
with SB1C3 or two or four, whatever you want to call it.
There is too much to begin with what's wrong with this bill.
There are the process and procedural issues.
There are the issues of local subversion,
and there's issues of constitutionality.
But the biggest issue for me is that we are here to talk
about a bill that is so dangerous, so absurd,
and so deeply unserious that I have to wonder,
what's made in the signal chat full of gun lobbyists?
Does somebody say, hey, you know what'd be fun?
Making it easier to sue cities for keeping
people are getting shot and everyone just sent a fist in an American flag and
fire emoji. It is funny but it would be even and it would be even funnier if it
wasn't a slap in the face to local control to public safety and to basic common
sense. I am tired of watching this chamber make it easier to carry guns than to
vote than to get health care than to afford rent. The people of this state are
sick and tired of that false choice too. And instead of listening to the people of Georgia,
instead of tackling gun violence, what does this bill do? It lets people sue cities and counties
for trying to protect their own residents. Let's break down just how ridiculous this process has been.
This bill was Russia committee, failed, and then brought back from the dead. No real public hearings,
no real input from law enforcement, no consultation with communities that will suffer the most,
The people who are begging for gun safety laws, ignored.
The city leaders that are trying to keep our streets safe, ignored.
The parents who don't want their kids caught in the crossfire, ignored.
But guess who wasn't ignored?
The gun lobbyists.
They had a front row seat while this thing got pushed through.
This tort scam intensified.
And guess who pays?
Not the gun companies.
Not the lawmakers that are pushing this.
The taxpayers.
Look, this bill basically says to cities not only can you not protect your own people,
but don't worry, we will let gun activists sue you for trying.
That's like banning seatbelts and then letting reckless drivers sue the DMV
for suggesting they buckle up.
Look, we just had an election where George is made it clear
they want stronger gun safety measures.
They voted for leaders who promised to take action against gun violence.
But instead, respecting the will of the people, this bill does the opposite.
It silences their voices and overrides the very officials
they elected to protect their communities in the first place.
This isn't just bad policy,
it's just a blatant disregard for democracy.
And you know what else is the matter under this bill?
Local governments.
Your mayor was comments since gun laws too bad.
Your city council wants to keep guns out of parks
and playgrounds, sorry, can't do it.
You want to stay for streets.
Well, you better cross your fingers
because SB163 says, good luck with that.
Look, by trade, I'm a numbers guy.
I mean, I'm an economics major for more house,
so we talk about that a lot.
Cycling with facts, not fear-mongering.
And here's the fact, gun violence
is the number one cause of death
for children in America, not video games,
not TikTok trends, guns.
And yet instead of addressing that,
we're debating a bill that does nothing
but create more lawsuits, more legal fees,
more headaches for local governments.
all will make it harder to keep people safe.
I don't know about y'all.
I did not come to this chamber
to be a glorified defense attorney for the gun lobby.
If this body actually cares about law and order,
then let's start by keeping guns out of the hands
of criminals.
But instead, SP163 or SP204, whatever you want to call it,
does the opposite.
It punches local leaders for trying to keep their city safe.
It shields dangerous policies from accountability
And it ignores the people we were elected to serve.
So to my colleagues who are still indecided,
I urge you to think about the communities we represent.
Our job is to listen to the people of Georgia
and make decisions that keep them safe.
This monstrosity of a bill does not do that.
I'm close with a scripture, Zechio 2230.
I looked for someone among them who were built up a wall
and stand before me in the gap for those who
cannot stand from themselves.
Right now, our children, our families, and our communities need us to stand up for their safety.
Let us not be silent in this moment.
Let us not be found unwilling to act.
Instead, let us do what's right.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker, you're at the well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As I said here today, and I listened, as I sat here today and listened to all the statements
that were made, and I saw what this bill was all about, and I'm going to tell you, if
you recall when I first got here, I had a nephew that had been killed in the city of
Savannah by someone that went in stole a gun and shot him stole his car and
thank God for our police officers. They were able to get him. He's still in jail
but has not come to trial. But this morning as I was reading my email I received an
email regarding this bill and I was ordered to vote for this bill and I was
ordered that why I should vote for it was because the City of Savannah is
trying to make us safer by saying that you must lock your cars and that you
You must lock your glove compartments because you know that there are people going around
trying to break into them.
That was to protect me and every resident in our community.
But the problem is, is that I was told that we did need to listen to what our city government
was doing.
But I should listen to people that want to do whatever they want to do with their guns.
I want my city to help to protect our children, our senior citizens and all of the people
that come to our community.
Why am I standing up here?
I want to tell you because in this communication that I received, I was told that
Either I do it, or, and I'm going to read it verbally.
Savannah, it says, join your gun owners.
Will keep me informed of your vote.
And what happens to this bill?
In capital letters, I will be watching what you do,
how you vote and will tell everyone I know to vote for our against you depending on your
performance on this and other gun issues.
Well, y'all know I don't like guns.
I will try to vote you out of office if your performance is not acceptable on this issue.
Well I say to you, think about residents in your community that need to be protected.
Think about the children in your communities that need to be.
I am happy that we made a decision to protect it by saying if you're not going to take care
of what is inside your car that could take a life, then you don't even need to be there.
So I want you to know my colleagues as I stand here this afternoon.
I want you to know that I need your support and I need your support so that communities
can make their own decisions of how they're going to protect our people against gun violence
by telling them to lock them in their cars and lock boxes in their homes.
I have a gun.
But it's locked up.
And I don't even like guns.
But I want please vote with me.
And I'm making it a personal thing
since it's a personal attack.
Please vote no.
The gentle lady has yielded the well.
Members, I'm going to take just a moment of personal privilege and recognize a former member
that's on the floor. If you'll join me in welcoming the former Camilla
Hobson who is now Camilla Jackson, she represented Albany and House District
153 and she's here with her husband Derek Jackson.
Thank you for joining us, Representative, former representative Jackson.
We're moving on to the proponents of the, I'm sorry, we do have another speaker to speak
against the bill.
The chair recognizes representative Ramon to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Madame Speaker of Pro-10.
Colleagues, it appears some of you have misplaced a pair
of spherical objects today, and it is making me furious.
And let me explain.
With deep respect to those who are engaging on this issue
seriously, and I mean that sincerely,
my opposition to this bill, in addition
to what we're going to be talking about from policy position,
is the fact that I firmly believe we should not
be rewarding those who threaten our staffers with policy.
And what do I mean by that?
This bill, as one of my colleagues mentioned,
is actually Senate Bill 168.
And unfortunately with Senate Bill 168,
the supporters of that bill actually posted a video
calling out by name a staffer who works for us
and said, come burn their desk.
An actual staff member that works for us,
that has never done anything but do their job
and who was essentially doxed on the internet.
And for what?
For following orders?
And the thing that really boggles my mind is that,
sure, the name of the original author, the bill,
and those supporters are not at the top of this legislation.
But the thing I've learned being here for three terms now
or three sessions now,
is that when you're in the minority party,
you sneeze wrong and your bill dies.
It happens, it's fine, it is what it is.
When you're the majority party you sneeze wrong and a bill moves out of rules.
Also fine, it happens, we saw it happen on Wednesday, it was great.
But for me personally, I really think that there should be a red line, a line that none
of us will ever cross no matter how much we want this policy.
I don't care if this bill is about puppies and unicorns and everybody gets a free one.
I don't care if it's my most important policy positions.
You do not get to threaten our staff and then get your policy and your bill on our floor
within a week.
That is a deep and sincere belief in mine.
There has to be a red line.
There has to be something that says, sure, you want to be a part of the legislative process,
whether you are elected or not elected, you are an advocate, a friend in the hall, whatever
it is, a constituent.
It doesn't matter.
We love to hear your voice.
We love to have you come down.
I beg my constituents.
I beg my people who aren't my constituents to come here all the time, all the time, please
come and work on these bills with us.
But I will tell you this, if any of them ever threaten a staffer, ever, to me that is a
red line, it should be a red line for all of us.
The reality is that we will always debate bills, we will always debate policy, we will always
have different positions.
that I deeply believe this is one of those
that there should be no daylight between any of us.
Bring it up next year, bring it up as a clean bill
by an author from this chamber.
Something that we own.
And here's the other thing speaking of procedure.
Last I checked, in addition to sneezing correctly in here,
you're supposed to be able to go toe-to-toe
with the speaker's general counsel and win
to get your bill on our floor.
Not lose and still get your bill on our floor.
Yeah, I said what I said.
Colleagues, I don't like the precedent we're sending here.
I really don't.
I actually think it's way bigger than this bill, like deeply and sincerely.
And again, with all due respect to the amazing policy discussions we're having,
the stories we're hearing, the sort of like moving stories of victims
that we are going to continue to hear about today.
It should not have to take somebody from the minority party
and a woman is stand up here and say,
you know what, we are going to protect our honor
and our dignity in this chamber.
It should not have to be me saying this.
It should not have to be me saying,
we should be protecting our staff
and drawing this red line.
And I am deeply, deeply disappointed
to see this bill on our floor.
I really, really thought we were better than this.
At some point, we have to have a red line.
And I hope, as you hear about the policy,
you think about the policy, you consider it.
I hope you also think about the bigger picture of what it means to pass this bill today.
Thank you Madam Speaker, I yield to you all.
The lady has yielded the well.
The chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's to speak for the bill.
You know, we talk about prevention a lot here in the last little bit, you know, it's common
to be used here.
It's where the higher levels of government tell the lower levels what they can do, what
they can't do.
You know, we do it a lot.
There'll be bills passed today or passed on Wednesday and on Monday that tell counties,
school systems, law enforcement, and on and on what they have to do.
As a member said earlier, we are the lawmakers, so we do get that opportunity to do that.
You know, these bills are hotly debated in preemption.
The cities and counties do try to defend their role, but we get to make the decision.
Most chairman Powell said a few moments ago, we passed preemption on 2nd Amendment rights
years ago, and we've adjusted our laws many times over the years making them better, making
them better for Georgia citizens, and making for sure, and one thing that's been my goal
over these years is to make sure that they can't carry a weapon where they choose to,
and they don't have to store it in their car.
And we've worked very hard to do that.
I'm very supportive of this bill.
And I think we get lost in some of all the rhetoric,
but the important part about this is that a Georgian
when he goes into my town, your town, any town
knows how to act, knows how to carry their weapon,
knows where to put it, knows where not to,
nor they can't go, and where they can't go.
It makes it clear and uniform laws.
And I hope you vote for this,
and join Chairman Powell in need of us
to support our Second Amendment rights.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
The gentleman is yielded the well.
The well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered.
There is a minority report and the chair recognizes
representative Evans for the minority report.
Good afternoon colleagues, I rise in opposition to Senate Bill 204.
Now we know state law preempts nearly any local gun rule regulation ordinance or resolution
that's already true we don't have to do anything to change that.
laws relating to guns are only allowed in the areas where we say they can exist.
And in this bill, we're adding storage laws to the list of things where we are not going
to allow a city to regulate.
So without this bill, local governments have been able to regulate storage laws, for
example, like requiring folks to lock their car doors if they have a gun inside so
they won't get stolen and commit a crime.
And others have talked to you about why that's a bad idea not to allow those kinds of common
since laws by local governments, but I want to spend a little bit of time talking about
another problem with this bill that we haven't talked about yet, I don't think.
This bill, if you look with me at line 81, this bill says that anyone, quote, who is or
has been subject to or aggrieved by a rule regulation ordinance or resolution that they
think is in violation of the limits that this legislature set on laws that local governments
can set can haul city officials to court to defend those laws. Now let me say that again.
You don't have to be aggrieved by a local law. You just have to be subject to it. And you
don't even have to be subject to it. You could have been subject to it in the past. You
could have moved. You never got fined. You never got arrested. You never got charged.
You just think the local government has passed a law that goes beyond the preemption and
you want to make somebody prove it.
You haul them into court, this bill allows you to do it.
Old law didn't do that.
Old law said you had to be aggrieved.
This bill does not say that.
You don't have to be damaged.
You can bring them in for injunctive relief.
There's two sections about how you haul them into court.
One for injunction, one for damages.
So just again, you don't have to be charged, you don't have to be arrested, you don't have
to be fined, you don't have to be convicted, you don't even have to live there anymore.
You just have to think that one of these laws goes too far and you want to bring the city
official in to account for it.
That seems like a lot.
We're setting up a system where a person who is or did live in a jurisdiction where a local
The law was passed.
Can Hall City officials end to make them defend the law?
And there's no place in this law that says
if the city official was hauled in and they found
that the law was just fine, that the city gets paid back.
No, no.
Think about the advocacy groups in this state
or across the country that would love to gin up residents
or form a residence just to make them prove it.
Y'all know I'm right.
This is going to chill local governments.
from doing even what we allow them to do.
But I do wanna talk about storage again for just a moment.
As I said, when I started,
this law would add gun storage as an area
where we are not gonna allow local governments to try.
Now this house had a priority this year
and at least last year and probably before that too,
to make encouraging of storage of guns safely a priority.
Let me say that again, this house had a priority to encourage the safe storage of guns.
We passed House Bill 79 this year, 165 to 8.
Last year we passed a bill House Bill 971, 162 to 3.
Both of those bills would have provided a tax credit for gun owners who bought a safe storage device.
Our priority, that house's priority, was to encourage safe storage.
After this bill, when a local government does exactly what we wanted to do, encourage
safe storage, they're going to get sued, and that doesn't even have to be by anybody
who's been damaged by it.
This is not our priority, y'all.
Our priority is the opposite.
This is the Senate's priority.
The Senate didn't pass our bill last year, obviously.
They didn't pass it this year.
to add insult to injury, they got it in.
They don't care about our priorities,
but somehow we are chopping at the bit to grab theirs.
And not just any Senate priority,
but a Senate priority lead sponsor,
the Senator who disrespected this house over and over,
our current informer speaker sued our staff,
essentially spit in our face any chance he got.
And we're like, give me what he wants.
I wanna do that.
They got our bill, we pick up theirs.
This first section, Senate Bill 163, is Colton Moore's bill.
This is not anyone else's bill, this is his bill.
So once again, we yield to other priorities, not ours.
I'm going to close with this because I'm reminded of a song.
I won't sing, but I'm going to talk about the song.
It reminds me of a song by the late great Toby Keith.
I want to talk about me.
I want to talk about me.
I want to talk about I.
I want to talk about number one, oh, my, me, my.
What I think, what I like, what I know,
what I want, what I see.
I like talking about you, you, you, you, you, usually.
But occasionally, I want to talk about me.
Occasionally, can it be about the house?
Does it always got to be about the Senate or somebody else?
They ignored our priorities on storage for multiple years.
And now we just pick up their priority.
from someone who disrespects this body every chance he gets.
I just don't get it, y'all.
Please join me in vote, no.
I yield.
The lady is yielded the well.
The chair recognizes Representative Willis to speak
for the bill.
Thank you, Madame Speaker.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
I rise today in opposition to Senate Bill 204.
This bill, as originally drafted by the Senate Minority Leader, was a really good bill.
Originally aimed at procedural criminal justice reform.
Quite simply has been hijacked to undermine local authority.
And I don't know about you, but I stand with my local leaders and not against them.
And for me, that's the city of Atlanta and that's Fulton County.
This substitute allows individuals to sue local governments for regulating weapons.
And the weapons carrier can file a lawsuit and recover damages and attorney's fees,
opening the floodgates to harassment lawsuits against not only city councils but law enforcement.
Now what works in your county may not necessarily be best for mine.
And in Atlanta and Fulton County, we're doing something right.
nationally ranked number four in the nation for economic development. We do. All right.
So hold up, wait a minute. If y'all thought I was finished.
We've spent the bulk of this legislative session hearing about how frivolous lawsuits are
running people and businesses out of Georgia, that they are the bane of our existence,
And yet, less than a week later, once again, we are presented with a bill that sets the
stage for what actually sounds magnetic for more lawsuits, but go off.
How will we defend taxpayer-funded lawsuits from anyone who says their gun rights were
infringed by a city ordinance?
So who are we? Who are we as a state body to continue to reach into localities, to dictate
to them what we feel is proper? What message does this send to any mayor or to a city council?
William Haslet once said that the only vice that cannot be forgiven is hypocrisy.
elected local officials should regulate public safety.
And we should stay in our lane.
And we should stay in our lane.
And with that, Mr. Speaker,
I yield the remainder of time to the gentle lady Westbrook
of Savannah's 163rd District.
Thank you.
The lady is yielded the well and the chair recognizes
Representative Westbrook to speak on the bill.
Thank you, Madam Speaker and good afternoon colleagues.
I rise today in strong opposition to Senate Bill 204 because it retaliates against the
duly elected leadership of the city I represent and against my constituents themselves.
It makes Georgia's communities less safe and it violates the public policy that this
His body communicated to Georgians that we value, which is safe firearm storage.
This is not a reinforcement bill, this is a retaliation bill.
It was Fulton County's turn on Wednesday, I guess it's Savannah's turn today.
But I'm here to speak for my community.
This is a Franken bill.
It started out as a perfectly good bill, and it was hijacked.
hijacked by a far right senator who I am confused as to why this body wants to carry his water,
but that's apparently what we're going to do.
This senator openly stated that he was targeting the ordinance passed by my city council,
despite the fact that he represents a district nowhere near my district, suburbs of Chattanooga
basically, but he wants to tell us how we need to handle our business in Savannah.
I represent a district that is mostly comprised of
in-town neighborhoods within the city of Savannah.
It is a dense urban district made up of some affluent neighborhoods
and also some neighborhoods that still show the persistent
lingering effects of segregation,
of under-investment, of poverty.
And social science data and criminology data tell us
that in districts that are suffering from those persistent lingering effects of our past sins
that there are challenges, and some of my district has those challenges.
Food insecurity, housing insecurity, lack of access to quality education, lack of access to good jobs,
lack of access to childcare.
And so we have some challenges and safety can be one of those in my district
So on top of considering the needs of Sivanians all Sivanians
We've got an additional challenge
We are a district. We are a city that is visited by people from all over the world
From all over the US and from all over the state of Georgia and we have to worry about them too and we do
But we welcome them. We ask them to come and walk our squares and eat our seafood,
including the Georgia shrimp. We've done so much to promote and protect in this chamber.
We ask them to have a good time, eat, drink, be merry. All we ask, all we ask,
is after you have enjoyed yourself, when it's time for you to go home,
please do not leave our community less safe than you found it. Tell me what is
unreasonable about that. We have an ordinance. It does not contrary to some of the
misinformation that you heard earlier. It does nothing to people who lock
their cars. Nothing. All our ordinance asks is if you bring your guns to town and
And Johnny Cash said you shouldn't do that.
We don't go that far.
If you bring your guns to town, lock them in your car
if you leave them.
Just lock them in your car.
That's it.
In Georgia, you can take them everywhere.
You all made that available.
You can take them in a restaurant.
You can take them in a bar and have a few drinks.
You can take them with you.
If you leave them in your car, lock your car.
It's not that hard, y'all.
This is a particular issue for our district.
I know y'all think that we need to make all the rules up here
and just tell all the cities how to do it,
but my city's not like your city.
My city's not like your town.
My city is not like the 2000 strong and population town
of the Senator who filed this bill.
Our issues are different.
We have a dense urban plan.
It's why people love to visit us.
We've got sidewalks right next to On Street Parking
and we have a problem with people walking down those sidewalks
and trying car door after car door after car door.
Which one is gonna be unlocked?
Which one can I pop into quickly
and see if I can find a gun line right there?
That is what they are looking for.
every time I go to a neighborhood meeting in my district every single time we
start with a public safety report and a Savannah police department officer stands
up and says to the neighbors please lock your car please lock your car if you
leave a firearm in it every single time we get that that request in 2024
266 guns were reported stolen from vehicles in Savannah.
Of those 266, 228 were stolen out of unlocked vehicles.
86%.
Again, we're just asking that people lock their cars.
I'll also mention, our ordinance also protects you when you visit our city.
It protects you from being victims of theft.
Once your firearm is stolen, you've lost your personal property.
You can't use it for protection.
You can't use it for anything at all.
A thief can.
The thief who gets your gun, they get to use it.
But you don't get to use it anymore.
Some of y'all are so worried about a propaganda's government
that is coming for your guns.
You are actually up here fighting a local government trying to help you hang on to them.
Make it make sense.
For my constituents and me, our ordinance also protects us.
It protects us from what can happen when a gun, which is otherwise just a tool in an object.
For what can happen when that gets in the wrong hands?
And that happens.
My community now has yet another firearm in the hands of someone who did not buy it from
a federally licensed firearm stealer and did not go through a background check.
To state the obvious, if someone is willing to steal a gun by definition they are not
law abiding.
They probably don't have a lot of reservations about using it for another unlawful purpose
or selling it to someone else who wants to use it for an unlawful purpose.
who cannot just walk into a gun shop and pass it back ground check.
So that is what my city's leaders were trying to address to keep our people safe.
Savannah passed this ordinance on April 11th of last year, it has not even been a year.
By May 1st, a test plaintiff had been found to sue the city of Savannah.
So much for cracking down on frivolous lawsuits.
His test plaintiff was not a citizen of Savannah, had never been cited pursuant to the ordinance.
He basically said, I don't have power locks and it's just too much effort for me to walk
around to the other side of my car and lock the door so that y'all can be safe.
Just couldn't muster up the effort.
In November of last year, his lawsuit was dismissed because he had suffered no injury, in fact,
that will change if y'all pass this law.
We lacked standing to bring the suit.
The lawyers know about standing and probably a lot of y'all do too, but quite literally,
it's just not his business is essentially what the court was saying.
The people whose business it is, my constituents, they are not suing the city council that passed
this ordinance.
They are electing and re-electing them.
Savannahans are not suing their city over this ordinance because they welcome it.
They know it's needed.
They are tired of having the debates on their neighborhood Facebook pages.
Every city dweller in Georgia knows this.
What was that sound?
Gunshots or fireworks?
When irresponsible people shoot into the air in rural parts of Georgia, the bullets come
down on pine trees.
When irresponsible people do that in our metro communities, they come down on roofs, they
They come down on hoods of cars, ask me how I know about that particular one, and sometimes
they even come down on people.
So what works in Yoll's area might not work in my area, my constituents are living with
the real costs of this, the costs of how unwilling Yoll are to ask gun owners who you have
assured us are all completely responsible people to perform the simplest tasks related
to safety and responsibility.
This bill also violates the expressed public policy.
We told Georgians that we hold.
When we passed the Safe Storage Tax Credit,
we told Georgians that Safe Storage of Firearms
is something that we value.
And I think it's worth remembering a little bit
about the history of that bill.
That was an idea brought by one of my Democratic colleagues.
Some of y'all kind of got the idea that was a pretty good bill.
And by the time we passed it, your names were all over that bill.
One of your caucus was the author.
Your names were in the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spot.
And some of y'all during the last campaign season went back to your districts
and you told your constituents and your voters
that you care about safe storage.
And I hope that's true,
because we're about to find out in just a few minutes.
We're about to find out how much y'all value that.
We're about to find out if you care about safety for Georgians
or if you care about appeasing extremists.
And I'll tell you, I've got a bad feeling
that when we adjourn tonight, the only legislation,
The General Assembly will have passed to address the number one killer of Georgia's children
and teens is one that makes it easier for people to sue cities that try to pass safe storage.
My time is running out.
There are a lot of things we could do on this issue.
We could pass background checks.
They cut every category of gun violence in half.
They cut trafficking down.
My city is also near on 95, kind of important for the iron pipeline of gun trafficking.
There are so many things we could do we have not done, but y'all want to micromanage local
governments instead.
You said you've done things to make it better.
What you've done is you passed guns everywhere.
You've decimated our permit carrying system.
The only real background check system we had.
You have failed to keep George in safe and your voters are going to watch and they are
are going to hold you accountable if you go after cities today instead of living up to
what you said were your values of safe storage for Georgians.
Thank you Madam Speaker, I yield the well.
The lady has yielded the well for what purpose does Representative Park rise?
Thank you Speaker Pro Tem.
I move that the Rule Substitute to Senate Bill 204 be laid on the table.

There is objection.

have up to 20 minutes for the chair's time. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith has
recognized to speak to the proposition. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We'll get
afternoon members of this August body. I'm going to end up yielding some time
to some other members on this but I won't point something out here that's
very important, not one, not one person in opposition to this legislation pointed out
where the home rule statutes allow a city to circumvent not only this issue before
but any issue. I'll call to your remembrance. From municipalities at least those
are a creation of this body and if they are circumventing the laws of this
state it needs to be corrected. I don't know if you all pay attention but we're
meet Grindr down there in 132 a lot of times. If we find something that is preempted by
federal code, we do are darned us to make sure that is taken out of the bill. It would
be very nice if municipalities and counties would pay us the same courtesy. I get aggravated
with it all the time. It just puts a bur under my cell. I've got some simple advice here.
Those cities and counties worried about litigation. If you don't attempt to circumvent state law,
you won't have to worry about being sued. Easy motion to dismiss. With that, Ms. Speaker,
I'm going to yield the remaining bouts of my time to the majority later this House and Chairman Powell.
Leader, if the stretch is recognized to speak to the bill, you'll allocate the remainder of the time with Chairman Powell.
Yes, sir.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today in strong support of Senate Bill 204.
And I want to go through some of the arguments that were made by the minority party when the bill was being debated and in Chairman's time.
But ultimately, this is an affirmation
of our strong and unwavering support of the Second Amendment.
And this legislation ensures that Georgians are protected
from government overreach that Georgians
are able to remain under the blanket of public safety
by being able to defend themselves.
And that ultimately, when we have circumstances
where local governments are taking action contrary
to our preemption laws that there are consequences
in place in code to address it.
Now at the heart of Senate Bill 204,
there's a clear principle.
The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,
not by Congress and not by a state,
and certainly not by a local government,
a county or municipal government.
Georgia's should be able to know that as they travel to different parts of the state,
be it Savannah or any other location, that their right to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed.
Now recent actions by the city of Savannah's liberal government have placed those rights
in jeopardy, leaving lawful gun owners open to punishment simply because a criminal breaks
into their, say, vehicle and steals a firearm. Now just think about that for a minute. If
a criminal breaks into my vehicle and steals my glock and I call the police to respond
And then I'm the one arrested.
It's outrageous.
We already have preemption to protect
Georgian Second Amendment rights in the code.
And when that is being circumvented,
it's necessary that we update the law to address that.
Now, getting into the specifics which were raised.
Yes, there are paths here that can be sought.
If a person is subjected to or grieved
by these kinds of local government,
acts, rules, regulations, ordinances,
that they would have options.
There would be the ability to seek a petition for mandamus
or seek injunctive relief from the court
to ask that this violation of their rights
is addressed in a courtroom.
But then there is also a damages option.
If they have suffered as a result of the action of local government,
they would be able to go to court and very clearly it is specified the damages that they could seek,
including attorney's fees.
And if it's necessary to pursue that through an appellate path,
liquidated damages that would ensure recovery under those circumstances.
This bill doesn't just preempt local overreach now or potentially in the future.
It empowers citizens and it allows lawful weapons carriers to bring legal action against
a local government or local office that violates this section of the law.
That's not just good law.
It's good constitutional stewardship for Georgians protecting their constitutional rights
from being infringed at the local level and giving them a clear path to address it in
our court system.
Colleagues, this legislation is about more than just firearms.
It's about the rule of law.
And it's about ensuring that Georgians are not subjected to the whims of local politics.
It's about honoring our oaths, in my view, to adhere to the U.S. Constitution, which
could not be more explicit in the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
We have an opportunity today.
We have an opportunity to stand together, to vote in favor of Senate Bill 204, to protect
the rights of our citizens, to speak clearly where others so confusion, and to affirm that
In Georgia, the Constitution and the Second Amendment still means what it says.
And Mr. Speaker, I yield the wealth.
I yield the remainder of the time to Chairman Powell.
Chairman Powell has recognized to speak to the bill for the remainder of the chair's time.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen.
You know, I didn't think this was going to be an easy task.
But I heard a lot of what is.
I've heard some things and comments made by the opponents to this bill.
And I understand politics.
This hasn't got anything to do with most of Yellow's minds in opposition about what's right.
Or about what preemption really means to the law.
You've heard some of the skilled jurists, Chairman Paul Smith, leader of the administration,
about what law was really about and about the need, and that's the need that we
have structure. I heard comments from some of the distinguished members of the
minority party today, but most of all of it was about their opposition to the
Second Amendment. I don't think I heard a whole lot about the preemption, but it
was about their opposition. I heard some comments who were hurtful to me, but I hear people talk
about and quote the tragedy of Appalachia and try to compare it to this. Shame on you. Shame
on you because there's not a soul in this building that would ever try to mix those two subjects.
I see it, but I see the politics of this, ladies and gentlemen, it's all about what
we want.
It's about a political position that I'm opposed to the Second Amendment.
There's a proper way to do that.
There's a proper way.
Let me tell you a little bit.
I've sat down and I thought about the preemptions.
So if you think, for those of y'all who think that local governments should be able to
preempt the law, so let's talk about the Bill of Rights.
Let's talk about freedom of speech.
Let's talk about freedom of religion.
What if somebody didn't want a mosque?
What if they didn't want a synagogue in their district?
What if they didn't want to allow women the right to vote?
And they just passed a preempted law?
What about the Civil Rights Law?
What about the Civil Rights Law?
I'm a realtor.
What about the fair housing?
We got a lot of people that have concerns about fair housing.
But what if some a local jurisdiction passed laws against the fair housing act or redlining?
I deal with this a lot of times in my professional life, and I have to stand up and actually leave
before I can even listen to that kind of talk about preempting, because my professional
business license would be in jeopardy.
So I want to talk about that prevention, and those of y'all who want to talk about the
second amendments and the need to ban theirs or to ban that, then mobilize your forces
and go after it.
But this is more about prevention.
Yes, I am a strong second amendment supporter.
But this is about allowing local governments
to step across that line.
I heard the good lady talk about shooting guns
into the air.
There's nothing says you can't discharge a weapon.
That's part of the provisions of local government
under their codes and all.
But when you talk about charging someone for a crime,
for having a weapon stolen, that is a violation.
This isn't got anything to do with frivolous litigation.
This is about doing what is right.
And I'm going to part with one comment
for every matter before you that you
don't do the right thing, then it will come back at some point.
Those things that we do that are a violation of somebody's rights, it will come back to
you in some other shape form of fashion.
Mr. Speaker, there's been a lot of talk about this.
We've burned a lot of hours on this or an hour or so, but I would ask the members of
this house to vote in favor of this legislation and let's stop this practice as nothing else.
It sends a message that the growing kudzu that creeps across a lot of the political subdivisions
today that this has got to stop on this subject and maybe it might have an impact on other
subjects.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the time.
Gentlemen, as you were to the well, that completes the chairman's time.
That completes the discussion on Senate Bill 204.

bill. We subbed a language in in education committee and it was vetted by the house education
committee so we don't have to worry about that. This bill requires students to take a computer
science class or a CTAE course embedded with computer science beginning in the 2031-31
32 school year. It changes the reimbursement cost of tuition for the Georgia virtual school
because that has not been adjusted since 2012, and it requires private online virtual schools to report enrollment to the student's homeschool district, and this is for purposes of keeping up with attendance so that we can get a handle on this chronic absenteeism policy, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill, and I will yield for any questions.

Repsync be queen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today, I rise in strong support of Senate Bill 179.
Because as a teacher, I see firsthand
how quickly our world is changing
and how urgently we need to ensure our students
are ready to meet that change head on.
This bill is about preparing Georgia students
not just for graduation,
but for a life in a digital fast-moving world.
SB 179 makes computer science a graduation requirement.
Starting with the class of 2037,
I can't believe I just said that out loud.
I want to be clear, this is not just about learning code.
So when we think about computer science,
we think about C++ and Java is not just that.
It is about learning how to think.
It is about logic, creativity, resilience,
and the ability to approach problems from multiple angles.
Whether a student wants to go into agriculture,
arts, or medicine, these skills are essential.
But right now, less than half of 1% of Georgia high schools
graduates have taken a computer science course.
And as an educator, I find this deeply concerning.
Our students are growing up, surrounded by technology,
but they don't understand how it works,
or how they can shape it instead of being shaped by it.
Meanwhile, thousands of jobs in our state
are going unfilled because we lack workers
with the necessary tech skills.
Computer science is no longer just for tech companies.
It's for farmers using data to increase crop yields.
It's for nurses navigating electronic health records.
It's for small business owners,
using e-commerce platforms to grow.
Digital literacy is essential,
and computer science is the foundation.
I have seen students light up from STEM lessons
when they realize that they can build something real
from nothing but an idea and a keyboard.
It's powerful.
That is the kind of empowerment this bill provides.
It tells every student in Georgia,
you belong in this future and you can build it.
SB 179 also understands that access matters.
It allows students to take the required course
any time between grades eight through 12.
It counts towards their math credit,
science credit, CTAE credit, fine arts,
world languages, or any electric credit.
So students don't have to choose
between learning of vital skill
and completing graduation requirements,
giving them the flexibility to pursue their passions
while still gaining the tools they need.
It also increases funding for Georgia Virtual School,
raising the tuition cap so more students,
especially in rural or underserved areas,
can take quality computer science courses online.
That's critical because where students live
should never determine,
oh sorry, because where a student live, sorry,
should never determine the opportunities that they have.
Just as important, this bill invests in teachers.
It funds professional development grants
to help educators become certified
to teach computer science regardless of their background.
because we know our students can't succeed
if we don't also invest in the people
who are facilitating the instruction in the classroom.
Technology is evolving at lightning speed.
If you had told this chamber 20 years ago
that we'd one day have platforms
that can generate life-like images,
answer complex questions in seconds
or even help write some of our speeches.
I think many of us would have laughed.
The pace of change can feel overwhelming even for us
And that's exactly why we must invest
in preparing students not to just keep up, but to lead.
With the rise of tools like chat GPT
and other AI platforms,
it's clear these technologies aren't a passing trend,
they're shaping the future.
And Georgia students need to understand
how they work because they're not going away.
They're here to stay.
Colleagues, this is about readiness.
It's about equity, it's about economic development,
but more than anything, it's about our kids.
Every single one of them deserves a shot at a future
where they're not just surviving, but thriving.
A future where they have understand
that the world they live in and have the skills
to unchange it, to change it.
What am I talking about?
I urge your support for SB 179.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Thank you, the ladies yield the well.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 218-218?
Senate Bill 218 by Senator Robertson, the 29th and others to be titled.
an act to amend Title 15 in the fish code of Georgia annotator relating to courts.
So it's required that the prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission
shall be assigned for administrative purposes only to the administrative offices of the court.
This bill ever referred to the committee on Judiciary Non-Civil Act Committee recommends
that this bill do pass by Rules Committee Substitute.
Representative Gullet.
Representative Gullet is recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm sorry for those of you who got bombarded by your sheriffs, but just for full transparency
in the rules committee this afternoon we removed the entire section that was problematic.
I think that was a bunch of caution, but just if you share for each that to you with concerns,
that entire section is no longer in the bill.
What this bill does is it moves the PAQC prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission from
the PAC, which is prosecuting Attorney's Council to the AOC to solve some conflict of
interest issues. It allows PAQC to issue subpoenas, and it creates penalties for the misuse
of subpoena issuing. It clarifies the appeal process, and lays out that the PAQC is the
first step, superior courts, the second step, appeals courts, third step, supreme court
before step. And it also modifies a confidentiality related to DAs and solicitor generals that
they request so they can find out about complaints made against them but have been dismissed before
reaching the public stage. Additionally, it will address specifically addresses their
concern that if a complaint at public sizes that they've filed a complaint, the PAQC can
tell the DA or solicitor what's going on so they can respond appropriately and publicly.
Mr. Speaker, it's a clean up bill, and I appreciate your favorable consideration.
Happy to answer a question if there is one.
The gentleman has one question representing more to you left as recognized for a question representing more.
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
Thank you.
Can you tell me if this particular version of this bill includes Section Code 151610,
the Georgia anointed code in this.
So let's say that one more time.
Does this version of the bill include section what?
15, 16, 10.
No, no, take a look.
What's that section do?
I may be give you a better idea from that.
Well, what that section actually does is require
that there is a deputy, a sheriff deputy, take care
of the every courthouse and every superior court judge.
In this particular version of the bill, it takes out every sheriff deputy and gives a gun to the attorneys.
No ma'am, that section was stripped.
This is LC492429S.
That's not in here.
But it still did not put back in, Georgia, 19 code, 15, 16, 10, which requires a sheriff deputy on premise at all times.
It's not removed as part of this bill.
Absolutely, it did not fit it back in there.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
I ask for your favor, consideration.
You're the one.
June was yielded the well.
It is any objection to the previous question being ordered.
Here in none the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute?

Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules?
Here in none the rules committee's substitute is adopted.
is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
Here in the other report, the committee's agreed to,
shall this bill now pass.
All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes.
All those opposed, we'll vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
have, all members voted.
If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 218-218, the Yez are 149, the Nays are 18, the Bill enter see the requisite Constitution majority, is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 12 Senate bill 12 Senate bill 12 by Senate again to the 47th and others to be entitled
an act to amend article 4 chapter 18 to total 50 the fiscal go to Georgia and it's added relating the inspection of public records
So it was revised, provisions related to documents and records in the possession of private persons or entities to spill them for the committee.
And governmental affairs, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Representative Victor Anderson has recognized to present the bill, Chairman Anderson.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, my friends, I'm bringing to you Senate Bill 12, and before I start I want to confirm that we're dealing with
with LC473644S.
This is the version of the Senate bill
that passed out of the governmental affairs committee,
not the version that was presented in rules on Wednesday.
So this bill does basically two things.
It defines the custodian or lawful custodian
of public records.
And the second thing it does is it specifies
that those they request to view those public records
must come through the custodian.
And then it further clarifies that any third party
individual or business or organization
that in conjunction with the government
may have some of those records
that those records would be provided
to the custodian upon request.
Mr. Speaker, that's what this bill does
and I will stand for any questions.
We're everything same part right in front of you to your lips. It's recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that I greatly appreciate that Senate Bill of 12 has reverted back to the original version that passed out of the Senate with near unanimous support, and that also passed out of committee with carefully vetted language?
I do believe this, sir, and as I might.
Is it not true that Senate Bill 12 is, you know, provides narrow safe, is drafted in a manner that is narrowly tailored to accomplish its purpose?
Yes, sir, the gentleman knows what he speaks, and thank you.
Thank you so much.
Gentlemen, representing Todd Jones, your right is recognized for a question.
Thank you very much for bringing this bill but isn't it true that this clarification
language is going to protect Georgia company's intellectual property?
It will and also individuals, so thank you sir.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, if there are no other questions, I will yield the will.
The gentleman has yielded the well, it is an objection to the previous question being
In order, Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered, is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute?
Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted, is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
Here in none, the report of the committee's agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the pass to the bill.
We'll vote yes, all those opposed.
We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
They're there.
I have all members voted.
