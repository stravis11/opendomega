The hour of convening having arrived, all members of this house will please take their seats.
All members of this house will please take their seats.
Report to the floor and take your seats.
Mr. Clark, would you ring the bell, please?

All right. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will
please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will
unlock the machines.
All members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock them
machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well good
afternoon. After the late night we had I'm not going to ask you to do any better
than that okay is that fair? It seemed like we were just left here but I want to
I think the members of this house were your hard work and the way we kind of kept it in the road yesterday.
We passed, I don't think we've had that busy a day since the 12 years I've been here.
We passed 60 bills, 60 bills yesterday.
that's the good news. The reality is is that probably about 95% of them will be ignored
when they get to the Senate so keep that in mind and I always try to remind people of that
when we get to cross over that you know unless there's some value to you and sometimes there is
of getting a bill out of the house. You know, they're going to operate on their own time
as we will with their bills. Just saying. All right, we will begin our day with Scripture
reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our
country. A chaplain this morning, I asked him how I should, how you'd like to be introduced.
he says, well, I'm not a preacher, not a lay speaker. I'm just a representative. And I
figure if Chairman England can get up and be a chaplain, I can too. So, you start the
dreams of many, Mr. Chairman. But I'm talking about Representative Dale Washburn from the
141st District has become a great member of this body, great friend, and whether he were
either of those things I would have to say he's just a good, decent man that I'm honored
to know and honored to have his friendship without a further ado, Representative Washburn
from the 141st will bring our devotion
and lead us in prayer and the pledge.
Representative Washburn.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
for the privilege of being the chapter of the day.
And thank you for those very kind remarks.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House
in the interest of full disclosure and confession,
I am not an ordained minister as the preacher, as the speaker said, what I am is a deeply
flawed individual. I'm a sinner, forgiven by God's grace, and Mr. Speaker, on that subject,
I am not going to yield for questions. I expected I would get one from Jason Ridley,
Among others in the house, I am not a preacher, I am blessed to be a follower of Christ and
my comments here today will be based on my experience of living life for a while, and
so I hope you'll be blessed by my observations.
There are three facts I want to share with you today to start with.
One is, God loves us.
He loves every one of us, he loves every one of you, he loves me, he loves all of us.
The second thing is an observation of mine after years of living is that life is a great
gift from God.
And the third thing is God wants us to enjoy life and to flourish in life.
And I believe he has a plan for that and that's what I wanted to share with you today.
I chose a scripture from Jeremiah 29,
it'll be for me, your verses to you.
11 verse 11 says, reads,
for I know the plans that I have for you,
declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for calamity,
to give you a future and a hope.
Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me
and I will listen to you.
The truth is, God does love us and He does have a plan for us and as a follower of Christ
I tell you that I deeply believe that plan is in His Son, Jesus Christ, what He gives
us, when He sent His Son to us, He gives us forgiveness for the past, example and teaching
for today and hope for the future. And I want to talk about those three things very briefly.
The forgiveness for the past is a basic part of us being able to flourish in life. We're
all sinners. The Bible tells us that in Romans 3.23 for all that's sinned and comes
out of the glory of God. And every one of us, all we have to do is look around and we
We see evidence of that.
I told you to start with, I am deeply flawed.
I have appetites and weaknesses that I have to control carefully.
My sweet wife who's not with us today, you all know she's sitting back there in the back
corner when she is here, but she's heard me say that many times that I'm deeply flawed.
And she told me one day, she said, you need to quit saying that.
People are going to think you've done something awful.
Well, the fact is I am deeply fraud and we all are.
So God sent His Son to down the cross for us to pay the price for our sins and if we
will avail ourselves of that and ask for His forgiveness, He forgives us and that is a key,
key, key part of flourishing in life as God wants us to because when you're able to
read yourself of the guilt of sins you know you have committed and you let your head
on the pillow at night, and know that those sins are forgiven, and that you don't have
to carry that guilt around with you, that's a key part of flourishing in life.
The second thing he does for us is give us an example in teaching for the day, either
through the book, through the Word of God, or the Bible tells us that Jesus was the word
made flesh, who dwelt among us.
I think about what Yogi Barra said, Yogi Barra was a great bad ball hitter, some of y'all
remember Yogi Barra with the Yankees. He was noted to be a bad ball hitter and he was
a hitting coach after he played a few years and he was standing there one day on one foot
and then the other watching a young guy trying to tell him what to do and finally he said,
just get out of the way and watch me do it. Well, when God sent Jesus to be our perfect example,
we had that opportunity to watch him do it and to read about what he did. And we know what he
He did, of course, besides going to the cross.
When He saw hungry people, He fed them.
When He saw sick people, He healed them.
And when He saw injustice, He stood up against it.
Most of what Jesus did, He exhibited kindness.
But when He saw injustice, He did stand up against it.
And I love that story, that part of the gospel, where He was over that of the side, making
that whip.
I can just see his disciples standing there looking and saying, what are you doing?
What are you going to do with that will?
And I expect he said, just stand up and watch, you'll see in a minute.
There is a time for us to stand up against things that we know that are wrong and stand
up against injustice.
And he said that example for us.
The third thing he does is he gives us hope for the future.
God never promised us that we wouldn't be sick and that we would have a lot of money and
that we wouldn't have trouble.
In any TV preacher that tells you that, it's lying to you.
Every one of us have faced trouble in life and we will face more of it because every
one of us is going to have that conversation with a doctor at some point.
It is not going to be the news we want to hear.
Every one of us is going to get a phone call one day.
going to be horrible news we don't want to hear. God never promised us otherwise, but
he did promise us he would never leave us or forsake us and he never does. Every one of
us in the room could talk about terrible situations we've been through and when we look back
on it you don't know how we got through it, but we got through it because God was with
us and the Holy Spirit carried us through it. And then, of course, the last thing is hope for the
eternal future. Because my belief is, if we trust Christ to save you, we are secured for eternity.
God does give us the plan to flourish and rife. And if we avail ourselves of that plan, we will
please him. And when you reach the point of flourishing in life, it will be that you
have reached that point of doing your best every day to please God. Jesus told us to take
it a day at the time. He said sufficient to the day is the trouble of our off. And so
every one of us have the opportunity to get up every day to try to do what we can to please
God. And when we fail, we can lay our head on the pillow at night and confess that sin and ask
to be forgiven of that sin and get up and start over another day. So I'll leave you with that today
and this is if you don't remember anything else today and this is again, there's no self-righteousness
here. This just comes from a few years of living. There are many different levels of
town and ability in this chamber and everywhere we go in every circle. Different levels of town and
ability. Some people are smarter, some people are better communicators, some people have different levels
of skill. Every one of us has equal ability to please God. That occurred to me a few years ago
that despite our levels of talent and ability, every one of us has equal talent and equal
ability to please God. If we will avail ourselves of the plan he has for us to flourish in life,
would you stand with me to pray? Now Father in heaven we are deeply and sincerely grateful
that you love us, that you created us, and gave us life, and that you have given us a plan
to flourish in life. Lord, I want to thank You personally for the great privilege of serving
in this house, and for the privilege of serving with these dear people. Lord, we pray that
You will bless every one of us, bless our families, keep them all safe, and bless them with
good health and happiness. We thank You again for this opportunity to be here today, and
We pray as we always do in Jesus' name. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the Black of the United States of America
and to the Republic of Louisiana.
One nation under God, indivisible,
to liberty and justice for all.

of 10 minutes. One and a half minutes per order. Chair recognizes representative Ken
Trail for a morning order. afternoon colleagues. Apparently spring and
forward this past weekend knock some sense into the US Senate and you may have
noticed yesterday they passed permanent daylight saving time out of the US
Senate. So now it goes on to the House of Representatives. Now I would venture to
say that all of us in this room know at least one or two Congress people that
we could reach out to and urge them to strike while the fires hot. Let's get
this thing done and let's put it to bed once and for all. Now that it wouldn't
take effect until November of next year. So we'd have about a year and a half
run up. So we've got one more fall back and one more spring forward between now
and then but we could get this ridiculous ridiculousness done with and move
forward and lock the clock once and for all. So I appreciate your help with
that. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Wynn for a
Good morning, order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
A year ago today, eight people were brutally murdered
by a lone gunman.
Six of the lives lost were Asian women.
And in the following days, we would learn more
horrific details about the tragedy.
How the accused drove from Cherokee County to Atlanta,
targeting three Asian owned businesses,
and inflicting unapologetic violence
on Asian women who are working in a vulnerable industry
during the height of the pandemic.
And it would take days for us to learn anything
meaningful about the victims, including their names.
Later, we would learn the victims for grandmothers,
mothers, sisters, many of whom came to our country
to escape poverty and to build American dreams.
But their dreams were never fulfilled.
They were robbed of their lives,
leaving behind their parents, children, and grandchildren.
And for one victim, six days passed
before her family members abroad,
even learned that she was among those who were killed.
And her body laid unclaimed in that county morgue
for 19 days.
Her funeral was attended by strangers,
no family members, no friends, no colleagues.
A year has passed and hate crimes against Asian people
in our country has increased by 336%.
So today, on this one-year anniversary,
let us reaffirm our commitment to this fight
against hate, racism, xenophobia, gender-based violence,
and not just for the Asian community,
but for the black community, the undocumented,
the LGBTQ community, the Jewish community,
the Muslim community, and for all those who have been impacted
by the same system of oppression
that took away eight lives last year.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Chair recognizes Representative Paris
for a morning order.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I don't really have a morning order. This is more like a moment
of personal privilege. I've got two birthdays and one is my daughter that's out in California.

for a morning order thank you mr. Speaker and good afternoon colleagues today
Today I bring to you Ilyana. Ilyana is a 16 year old girl who enjoys spending time with
her family, dancing, playing cards, watching football, and enjoys reading, cheerleading,
romantic movies, the Bulldogs, and a show named Degrossi. I googled it, it's a Canadian
show. But I did want to say we have to connect what we do in this body to who we work for.
And yesterday, my good friend, Representative Weed Hour,
Representative Thomas introduced a bill that talked about
independent limbic programs.
At 16, Ilyana would be in one of those programs.
And God forbid, we don't find her a forever family.
She will learn how to be an adult in one of those programs.
So thank you to this body.
Thank you to my good friend, Mr. Weed Hour,
Representative Weed Hour.

Good afternoon, colleagues.
We come today to talk about our high school
teams from Augusta.
On last week in class 2A, we had two local teams,
Butler High School, and West Side
that competed for the state championship in basketball.
And of course, West Side was the winners.
We were proud of both of our teams.
And on Friday, Cross Creek, Razorbacks
was also a back-to-back winner in the high school.
We commend our students, our staff,
our administrators, and our coaches.
And we really, really, really continue
to pray for all of our athletes
that this is their ticket to the next level in competition.
Thank you, and we yield the well.
Chair recognizes the Dean of this House, Dean Smirey, representative of Nullowitz and
Chairman Knight for a morning order.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We are here today on behalf of the Georgia Japan Caucus to share that we're getting news
out of Japan that a powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck there earlier today, almost
close to midnight in Japan.
This is near Fukushima, Japan, which is where almost to the day, 11 years ago, a devastating
nine magnitude earthquake, tsunami, and ultimately 19,000 people were killed, followed by also
a devastating nuclear disaster. We don't have a indication yet of how many deaths there
might be of what's happened. This was a 7.3 magnitude earthquake. Thankfully, the news
does indicate we shouldn't expect any devastated tsunamis, but we do want to stand here united
with our friends from Japan who are here across Georgia and our friends who are in Japan.
Thank you.
That is all of our morning orders for today.
