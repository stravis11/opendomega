If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
Does anybody feel like I do that it's a great day to live in Atlanta and in the state of Georgia today?
And that one just a little barely won't win last night, that was a beat down.
It made it even better.
So pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Georgia Article 3 Section 2 paragraph
2, the General Assembly shall apportion the Senate and House District such districts
shall be composed of contiguous territory.
The apportionment of the Senate and of the House of Representatives shall be changed by the
General Assembly is necessary after each United States decennial census.
This duty in the Georgia Constitution is parallel to that provided for by the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States.
Section two with respect to the United States House of Representatives, and I hereby declare
this special session of the Georgia House of Representatives in 2021 open for business.
Clerk will now read a proclamation from the governor calling for a special session.
Whereas Georgia Constitution Article 5, Section 2 paragraph 7 grants the governor the powers
to convene a special session of the General Assembly, stating in there by limiting its
purposes. And whereas the regular session of the 2021 General Assembly adjourned
Sinidai on the morning of April 1st, 2021, and whereas the governor has determined
that certain purposes warrant the convocation of a special session. And therefore, by virtue
of the power and authority conferred upon me by the Constitution of Georgia, I, Brian
Peacamp, Governor of the State of Georgia, do hereby convene the General Assembly of this
state and special session on Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021 for the purposes and only those
purposes specified as follows.
For enacting, revising, repealing, or mending general law for the division of the state
and of appropriate districts, from which members of the Georgia State Senate shall be elected,

districts from which members of the House of Representatives to the United States Congress
shall be elected.

Number three, for enacting revising, repealing, or amending local laws which the General Assembly
deems necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship or to avoid undue impairment, the public functions
of consideration and enactment thereof are postponed.

at the City of Atlanta on this 23rd day of September 2021,
Brian Peacamp, Governor.
Doorkeepers will please close the doors
and keep them closed.
Representative Kirby, can I deputize you over there?
Thank you very much.
We will begin our day today with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which
we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
I have the distinct honor and personal privilege of introducing the chaplain today, a member
of this body since 2009, a friend, not just to the chair, but to all of us in here, but
he has been a particular friend of mine, a gentle and humble man who speaks, may speak softly,
But he knows where off he speaks.
I've come to really respect and love Mack Jackson, and I so enjoy hearing his messages.
I know that you will be blessed by it today, and I know that what a great day to hear from
our colleague, Representative Mack Jackson, from the 128th House District.
Jackson. Good morning. Thank you, Ms. Speaker, for that introduction. It's always an honor
and a privilege to be able to represent God and the Word of God. And I want to thank
you for giving me this honor, Ms. Speaker, to open up this special session on this day.
I would have started out by with a joke that I heard.
I heard a joke about a revenue agent from back in the days
when moonshine was being made.
Now, Dean Smiror asked me to pray for him.
I asked him to pray for me.
So the agent not gonna farm was door one day
and proceeded to tell him who he was
and why he was there that day.
He told the farmer that he need to walk over his property.
The farmer told the agent,
Don't go down in that pasture down by the big oak tree.
The agent took out his badge.
And he explained to the farmer that that badge gave him
the authority to go any part of his property
that he desired to do.
This badge gives me complete authority.
So the agent immediately walked down by the big oak tree.
Well, the biggest bull that he'd ever seen
started running toward him.
The farmer heard the agent yelling for help.
The farmer walked over to the fence and yelled to the agent,
show him your badge.
In the book of Isaiah, chapter 40, verse 28 through 31,
we find these words,
has thou not known?
Has thou not heard
that the everlasting God, the Lord,
the creator of the ends of the earth,
Faints not, neither is weary.
There is no searching of his understanding.
He gives power to the faint and to them
that have no might, he increases strength.
Even the youth shall faint and be weary
and the young men shall utterly fall.
But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
They shall run and not be weary.
They shall walk and not faint.
An eagle is a unique creature.
He soars high where no other bird flies.
He has incredible vision.
He can see things from about three miles away.
He'll stand on a mountain and he'll char the storm.
But instead of running from a storm,
the eagle will prepare for a storm.
He'll lock his wings in place and wait on the storm.
And when the storm comes, he'll brace himself.
And the wind from the storm will push him higher and higher.
His wings will lock in place, and he'll fly above the storm,
and look down on it until it's over, and he'll fly on home.
We've been through a storm in this last year.
Some didn't make it, but those of us who didn't make it
should have more love in our hearts, more kindness in our hearts,
more timidness in our hearts, because if it had not been for the Lord who was on our side,
where would we be? Let us pray. Father, you're the God of all grace. And today we're thankful
for your mercy and your grace. Leading God us through this special session,
Give us the wisdom to do the business of the people of this great state.
Bless the governor, bless our speaker, bless the lieutenant governor.
Bless each member in this body that love and kindness be visible in our
daily interactions with each other.
Let everything we do bring glory to your kingdom.
As Jesus said, not our will, but let your will be done.
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
Let's have the pledge of allegiance.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

How about the embrace?
I want to tell you what, we've been waiting for a while, I've been a raised fan for
Or, quite sometimes, almost as long as you, since you're a
little bit older than I am, but that was awesome, wasn't it?
Great bunch of guys that did a great job.
And I know I'm proud of them.
And proud for America's team.
Here we go.
Well, as we have prepared for this special session,
we're all certainly want to maintain the order of our lives.
And I hope this resolution will help us do just that.
For those of you that don't see about like I do,
I'm going to go through the resolution
with you line by line.
And certainly I think that'll make it a little bit easier.
We'll start with line 336 on this scheduling resolution.
Both chambers in session through Friday from today,
Wednesday 11, 3 through 11, 5.
Then both chambers are out of session on 11, 6,
on 11, 7, Saturday, and Sunday, this weekend.
We will reconvene on Monday 11 on the 8th of November.
Lines 7 through 11.
Through the remainder of the special session,
Both chambers of the General Assembly are adjourned
on each Saturday and Sunday.
Unless we decide otherwise
with a subsequent scheduling resolution.
Lines 12 through 18.
Both chambers are responsible for their own adjournment
and convening schedule within the schedule of this resolution.
resolution. Each chamber can decide what their schedule is for a Monday through Friday
doing the special session, but there's no doubt it's clear that they will not be in on
the weekend unless we pass another scheduling resolution. Part two of the resolution is
the simple language we always adopt in our resolutions of scheduling is the standard
emergency procedures and that is standard language that we utilize each year we've used
over the years. On Monday, this coming Monday, which will be day four of the special session,
the governor is hosting a Veterans Day Memorial celebration in the Rotunda at 10 a.m. So our
standard time, of course, is to come in at 10, but we will back up our starting time to
11 a.m. Is that not correct with speaker? That is correct. So that is the
resolution of how we will conduct our business from here until we complete this
most important work that we're assigned to do by the governor's call and I
would certainly I hope you we'll certainly we'll be able to pull that up now
but that that is what we're going to do and how we'll conduct our business and
Now, I would ask of your favorable consideration on HR2EX, our
adjournment schedule and resolution.
Any questions, Mr. Speaker?
I had one just to clarify, we will adopt our own adjournment
resolution for Thursday, November 11, is I understand.
So we will not be doing any business-owned veterans day.
Yes, sir, and thank you for reminding me.
I forgot to mention that.
We'll allow us to certainly be in our home communities
if we so desire to celebrate one of the most important days
in our country.
And certainly, I certainly do appreciate you
reminding me of that.
I did miss it, but that certainly will be the case.
Thank you, Mr. Baker.
I see no further questions.
Well, I ask for your favorable consideration.
Thank you all very much.
I look forward to working with you.
Is there any objection to the adoption of House Resolution 2EX?

Legislative and congressional reapportionment that completes first readers
While we're waiting, as we all too frequently have to do on the Senate to take up very controversial
matters like notifying the governor that we're in session, I'm sure that's provoking
some speeches over there by people, but we're going to go on with our business and go
on to morning orders.
We only have one morning order today, and given the nature of the morning order, I am
not going to limit the time.
Chair recognizes for a morning order, representatives Bentley, representative Al Williams, representative
of the Dean of the House, Dean Smirey, representative Hinkley and Chairman Allen Powell for a morning
Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I stand this morning along with other members of the
House of Representatives that served with Uncle,
Representative Lynn Moore-James.
He always be representative Lynn Moore-James
from rural Georgia, who served in this chamber for 20 years.
He was well loved here at the state capital
too, and especially in his home community
of Macon County, Monizuma.
And we're so very grateful to his lovely wife, Miss Faye
James who stood by him and took really good care of him as a state representative and
as at home doing his time of illness.
This is a very emotional time for me and I'm so very grateful to have all of your love
and support to help me make it through this time as we all know that I laid my husband
to rest one day after my twelfth wedding anniversary and then to now be standing here talking
about home-going services celebration of life for representative Ledmore James.
And before I become too very emotional, I'm going to yield the remainder part of my time
to represent it if our williams. Thank you.
Blessed in the sight of the Lord is the death of one of His saints,
and truly your scent has gone home to be with the Lord.
I heard Scotty tell someone as I was coming in the chamber that this was a family,
And this was, then, more James' his family, then more of God.
He loved his faith, loved his family, and he loved this house.
It was seldom that I left here on Fridays, and I didn't call him and review the activities
for the week.
He was not just a colleague, he was my dear friend, seldom did a month fast that I did not
along with my wife, drive to Montesuma.
Monday a week ago, I went after coming from another funeral in Philadelphia and he couldn't
talk to me, but we talked a long time. He looked at me and I looked at him and I rubbed his
head. And I thanked God for having a man like Lynn Moore James in my life. But I said
this morning, I've never met a woman who was a better wife than Fay James. She took care
of Linmo, but sometimes he really reminded me some months ago. She took care of Linmo
a long time before he got sick. I used to miss her by wife because Linmo would sit down
even have to take his shoes off, y'all. And when she took them off, she rubbed his feet.
I hadn't, I got 43 years in and I hadn't quite got there yet.
But when we lay him to rest in the red clay of Macon County on Friday,
Saturday, Saturday at one. No pleas that a gentle giant walked among us. If you
didn't like Len Mo James, you just didn't like people. I thank God for what he
met to me, and asked for strength, if they asked me to preside on Saturday. And as of
this moment, I don't know if I can.
I just want to take this moment to say that Lynn Moore Jane was a dear friend. I knew
proud to come into the General Assembly. He was just a great spirited guy. We're just blessed
that he came our way. We're going to miss him. I remember Al calling me and the day before he passed,
I called his wife, Fay, and we had a great conversation and Elle texted me the next morning that a giant
pantry has fallen in the state of Georgia. They're a little more James. So we thank you for this time
Amen, this is a wonderful tribute to a wonderful gentleman.
That a great, great friend.
Thank you.
And at this time, we'll ask everyone for bow your heads for a moment of silent, please.
Jesus' name, amen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
