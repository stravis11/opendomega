Anyway, I don't know what you got.
They say I'd like to talk.
Representative Minks, do you mind starting us out
with a word of prayer?
Absolutely, let us pray.
They're having a father just thank you for this day.
The opportunity to come together to continue
to work out issues facing many Georgians across our state
or guy would just pray that what we do
will be pleasing unto you and that your will be done.
Be with our families that are traveling here
to be with us to your having a father.
Be with those families that may still be at home
or waiting loved ones to return.
Just got our conversation to your early father
and bless us.
guidance and direct snow things and all things we ask in your name. Amen. All
right. Later Gooch, I believe you wanted to share some
remarks. I'll be glad to. I'm glad to be here where we're at now with this
conference committee. I come here in good faith to try to try to work out our
differences between the two bodies and to try to do something to help the
The people that made me who I am and the folks that I represent back home and the hardworking
farmers and foresters of our state and I hope we can do that the day and I hope we can
get something that everyone can agree on and hopefully get it passed to help the people
of our state and so we shall see.
Leader Gutes go ahead. Number seven. Thank you Chairman Goodman and Chairman
Jasper's and Chairman Meeks and Whip Berchette and Chairman Dolezal. We have
had a full long session. This is day 40. We've got a lot of work to do before
we all leave here tonight and this piece of legislation has been in this
building for more than one year. I think it's been around four years or so. I
I think I see nodding heads out in the audience.
It's an important piece of legislation for industry.
Obviously our ag industry is our number one industry
in our state.
We want to continue to promote it, protect it,
but we also have responsibilities as a state
to protect the citizens and protect the investments
that we have made in our infrastructure.
We have spent billions of dollars over the years
in the 12 years that I've been in the Senate.
We went from practically not being able to make bond payments,
not being able to pay our employees,
and basically not building any new roads
because of inadequate funding.
In 2015, we did what we thought was the right decision.
We increased the gas tax and the diesel tax in Georgia,
which increased over a billion dollars a year
of additional revenues.
And we have seen significant improvements
in that infrastructure as a result of that investment.
The billion dollars a year that we increased in 2016
as a result of passing house bill 170
was a bare minimum that we were told by the experts
that we needed to just maintain what we had.
And we were told day after day after day,
we could not improve our infrastructure
without additional funding.
We were able to get a billion dollars
and we knew that was not gonna be sufficient.
The last four years, we've spent time, chairman Jasper's,
chairman Gianne, chairman Dolezal, myself,
chairman Beech, and others, chairman Tanner.
We've had study committees on freight and logistics.
We have a tremendous state to do business.
We're here all the time.
We're the number one state to do business.
We have the fastest growing port in the nation
or on the eastern seaboard at least.
We have the number one airport,
the busiest airport in the world.
We have all the right ingredients of best climate,
but we have an infrastructure that is not adequate
to continue to support the kind of growth
that we have experienced and what we expect
to experience in the future without investing billions
and billions of dollars more to not only maintain
but to enhance that infrastructure.
And so this decision tonight has to be bigger
than just about allowing additional weights
on farm trucks, ag trucks, or timber trucks.
It's got to be more than adding 4,000 pounds per load.
This discussion has to go from tonight forward
through the next six to eight months,
talking to the people that are in this room
and the people that are listening to us online
to say the Georgia businesses have to be a part of the solution.
We need every one of you to be back in this room
the next time these two transportation chairman calls
meeting for this discussion because we've got to find additional funding to fix the
problems that we know or that are coming. We have to invest in this infrastructure.
So whatever we do tonight, it's not the end of the conversation, it's the beginning
of the conversation. If a bill passes here tonight, we can't say, all right, we're finished.
Y'all go and you'll have your way or you won't have your way. But instead, we're going
to be back in this room in the next few weeks talking about it even more. We need additional
funding. I don't know where that additional funding would come from. We've
spent a lot of money over at the DOT looking at it with consultants. We have
studies. We have a freight logistics plan that has just been completed that
indicates how much that money is and it's in the billions of dollars with the
V. And so Mr. Chairman, I want us to make sure we keep the big picture in mind as
we go through this conversation tonight. This bill that the Senate passed gave
us a one-year extension on the truck weights that were increased from 84,000
pounds to 88,000 pounds and we narrowed it down to ag industry and timber
industry trucks only. We put a carve out to where those extra weights would not
apply in the non-attainment counties in Atlanta. There's about 13 counties
that that would apply to, we increase the fines for bad actors.
If you're pulled over by a motor carrier, you would be weighed and you would be fined accordingly.
We also put language in our bill that came out of the Senate that allowed local law enforcement
to do the enforcement as well.
And I know people in this room have heartburn with that.
And so we need to have that discussion as well.
believe that if you're going to be able to carry the extra weights, you should be in compliance
with the letter of the law. And that's important for two big reasons. One is public safety and
two is going to help us to be sure that the bad actors do not continue to degrade the infrastructure
of our back roads, especially county roads that are built to substandard performance. And we know
our interstate routes are built to good quality standards but for whatever reason the federal highway
will not allow you to go over 80,000 pounds and so what we're asking in this legislation is allowing
is for us to increase our weights not on the interstates but on other roads other than interstates to
include secondary county and city streets so what we have to do is be very careful in how far
this bill carries us into the future. One year, in my opinion, is adequate. 88,000 pounds is a
5% increase over what we had. So I think it was a safe approach. It was a carefully crafted bill
that Chairman Dullesall and I worked on together and it came out of the Senate with 44 votes for it
and a few votes against it. If we make drastic changes to this conference committee report tonight,
We may lose the bill. I just want everybody to be prepared for what could happen.
So thank you for letting me share a few words and maybe others will want to share some words and maybe we can talk and ask questions.
Absolutely.
No doubt that we're going to have needs in the future.
I just, from my personal point of perspective, and maybe it's just because I'm a, you know,
South Georgia farmer holding our farmers hostage to get it, there's something that doesn't
sit very well with me, and the folks that I represent, but I would like to, who would
like to go next, you know, representing Meeks?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and leaders, Mr. Leader, and Mr. Chairman, and Wilbur Chett, and
Chairman Jasper's certainly appreciate the many,
many hours of debate and conversation that has taken place
with House Bill 189.
Many of you probably know that House Bill 189
that finally passed the House was actually
the third version of the bill that passed.
One that we took from the, as introduced,
we kept making changes to it, trying to make it better,
trying to work with industry to make sure that we were addressing the issues to the
leader's point, not all of rural Georgia has an interstate that runs through it.
As we look at the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, margins are thin.
As we put input cost onto those loads, that's not something that we pass along to the end
user, we absorb that cost as a cost of doing business in a time when input cost and margins
are extremely thin.
I think that's one of the things we have to look at.
We look at tax credits and other things that we do for businesses and I sit around and
I think about this and I'm like okay if a business really doesn't like what we're doing,
have the opportunity to pick up and relocate somewhere else. That's not the case with
the land people. That's not the case with the farm land. We can't pick up and move to
another state if we are trying to be competitive in an area in which we can we can do something.
We run under an executive order now for three years at 95,000. I know last year the whip
had a bill that came out I believe at 95,000. I mean there was conversation about going
to a hundred. I felt like we started at nine and we backed it up to 88, felt like we had
a good compromise in the house in the build that could be workable for the industry, for
the economy, for the end users, for the customers. And I agree it is a big picture. But I think
we have to remember as we move forward that, you know, I think the industry is happy to
be at the table and help come with ideas but when we look at the bottom lines of where
we are and producers are as opposed to one that can be passed on to the to the end consumer
I think it's one of the things that we have to keep in mind.
I know a lot of hours have been spent on this bill both those that supported and those
who oppose it.
I certainly appreciate everyone working with me and trying to get us to a workable solution
as we move forward on the day 40 here of Sonny Dye.
So thank you for all the efforts and hopes
that we can come to a resolution
that's positive for the industry.
Thank you.
Chairman Jasper.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just real quick.
And we all want to have lots to do.
You know, thank you for the openness
that we have in this discussion.
I think everyone that's been involved in this
has been very open in the committees.
You know, we had a nearly five and a half hour meeting
the first time we heard it this year in January.
You know, to let the public had what 90 questions
by members to see how we drill down into the center,
I mean, Representative Meeks is a deal.
I, you know, and I appreciate this.
It's a great discussion and the openness of it.
You know, Senator Gooch, I agree with you absolutely
that as you and I have worked together for the last three years
on infrastructure needs.
That's the overhanging cloud over all this.
You know, I put forth a house bill this year
to kind of look at just House Bill 617
to look at a plan to spend money.
How would we go about taking infrastructure needs
that we, and how we apply money toward it
if we can determine what we do.
And I hope we continue to look at that next year.
You know, the only thing I just want to throw out
And a couple of things is, you know, local law enforcement
enforcing these laws.
I think, you know, the motor carrier division
is a very professional well-trained
precise group of people.
We got to know them in the two community meetings
we had in the house, and I certainly want to keep them
at the forefront of making sure that we do stop bad actors.
And I, we all recognize there are bad actors out there
in that that group can do a good job doing that
and we'll do it right.
But you're right, infrastructure needs are huge,
but I think with the side of the local agricultural needs
are great in this area too.
I look forward to finding a solution.
Thank you.
Chairman Dullesall, are you here to say something?
Representative Berset, what number are you nine?
Okay, go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm just excited to be on my first conference committee.
I know what doing my hands.
What are we doing here?
I totally understand.
I shave just for this conference committee, just so everyone
of you all know.
So that should earn me some credit here.
I think the Senate did some good work
in improving the bill of the House.
I just think there's a few provisions in here
that if we tweak a little bit,
we can get to a workable solution
that both benefits the opportunity
for the industries that continue to grow,
while also understanding that these folks
are using these roads and that they should be
cognizant of the necessity of the state
to be able to keep these roads in a state
or in a place that keeps our roads in the state that they are now, right?
So we want good roads in the state of Georgia.
I just, I think that a one year is not a long enough time to figure this out.
I get that we have some, you know, some budgetary needs coming up fairly quickly.
And frankly, I don't know anywhere else that we sort of say,
hey, you guys need to be here at the table to make sure
that we can tax you appropriately.
I think that any time taxes are talked about in this building,
everybody's going to come to the table
because they don't want to give their pound of flesh, right?
So they're going to be in here advocating on their behalf.
And I don't think we should pick out
just a couple industries here.
I do get the, you know, the point of it to make sure
that they are sitting here, but the folks that I'm dealing
with that are advocates for raising the weight,
they're here every year.
They're here every year.
They're working on their issues every year.
You think you get their issues handled this year
and they come up with new issues next year.
That's the way it happens.
I don't think they're going anywhere.
I think that it's a, like I said, you guys did some good work.
Are you thinking of, you know, in a different manner than we are in the house?
That's why our process is perfect.
I'm just asking that we come to some terms here that the industry can live with and the
cynic can live with and let's get a bill passed.
There's been too many hours under this gold dome dealing with this issue.
You know, I think we've reverted back to a weight that is a reasonable ask, 88,000 pounds.
consider the other initiatives we have in this state here we're you know we're
advocating and running down a road so fast that sometimes I can't figure out
where we are with these electric vehicles and nobody's thinking about you
know a Tesla being two and a half times the weight of a camera or thinking
about a commercial truck that's going to be 15,000 pounds heavier empty if it's
going to be a battery operated truck. Those conversations need to be had if we're going
to be walking down this electric vehicle road. So I'm just asking that we look at some
of these provisions here, the sunset, this radius 175 miles. I mean, currently, correct
if I'm wrong, you don't even have to have a CDL if you're a farmer and you can drive
150 miles from the farm. I'd like to see us at least match that code section that allows
150 miles, and I'll be honest with you, I think that most of the folks that are in these
industries, they'll tell you they don't haul much further than, they certainly don't
haul more than 150 miles, they haul, you know, try to stay around 100 miles, I think
that's probably the spot where it's not economical anymore to haul wood or haul farm
products. Those two provisions, and then this local enforcement thing, I'd like to have
a conversation about the local enforcement thing. The conversation that I've had with
my folks back home, they can't even get deputies enough to respond to domestic violence calls
or run radar on a road, and I don't think that it's practical to say that our local
share so they're going to or PDs are going to go out and buy scales and get the
training and put them on the roads ready to you know enforce this law. I think
that you know it's a lot of all approach but we need to be a little more measured
in that approach because everybody is telling me that they're having hard
enough time getting folks hired for these positions to do just you know public
safety from a, you know, from a burglary, fire arms, kidnapping, you know, just
doing the regular run of the mill law enforcement. We're going to add to
these local guys. I think that's a provision that I'd like to discuss here.
And I don't know how this goes, Gucci. I know you've been on these things
multiple times. So you tell me when it's low down or when to stop and I will.
And those, I'd just like to talk about those, see if we can come to some terms that we
could get the industry to live with and you guys can live with so that you feel we have
got enough hook into them to get them back here to sit at the table and talk about, you
you know, how we're going to fund these all roads in our bridges.
That's all I got, Mr. Chairman.
Number seven.
Thank you.
We'll help perchette.
Let me, since you've identified three areas of concern, which is basically the
the Jess of the bill now.
The local law enforcement piece.
Let's talk a little bit about that and drill down some.
As you know in this bill, it's not a mandate that the locals enforce it.
and it's totally optional.
Each county would make that decision
or each jurisdiction, whether it's the city PD
or a county sheriff's department,
or whoever it's always subject to appropriations
by the governing authority,
whether it's city council or county commissioners,
and there would have to be certification training requirements
just like we do with motor carrier division in the state.
But why would you be opposed to a county
that wishes to invest in the equipment,
whether that's $5,000 for portable scales
or $10,000 for training, whatever the number is.
If the county is willing to invest in that,
and allow that police department or that sheriff's department
to go out into those communities
to protect their citizens for public safety.
Now, we're not just talking about
weight that would tear the roads up,
but we're talking about public safety as well,
especially in back roads.
A lot of these county subsurface treatment roads
are very thin, but they're also very narrow.
Very little drainage.
I've been all over South Georgia with Chairman Goodman.
I live in North Georgia.
I grew up on a farm.
I understand it.
I was a county commissioner.
I understand how some of these roads are built.
They start out with dirt.
And in North Georgia, we use granite for base.
And then we put a little chip cell down,
which is tar and gravel.
Few years later, we get a little bit more money.
We put a couple inches of binder or e-mix and then come back,
top it with F-mix or whatever,
topping you want to put to make it slick and pretty.
But two, three years later, it starts to crumble,
depending on the thickness of the asphalt and the base.
If the base isn't prepared correctly,
the roads are going to come all to pieces.
They're not going to last.
We have to let the county commissioners
protect their investments.
I don't think Motor Carrier has enough resources
to take care of the interstates
in the state routes that we have today.
I think they do a great job.
Someone's bragging on them earlier.
We need to invest in their resources as well
to protect our citizens, protect our roads.
So why would we be opposed to allowing counties
and cities to do that on their own?
And I get it.
The sheriff's may not politically want to do this,
but at some point they have an obligation
to enforce the laws on the books.
They do it today on other things.
They run radar, they catch speeders.
I've been pulled over for speeding, and I violated the law.
I paid the ticket.
Same thing should happen with any of us
if we're doing something wrong.
I don't think anybody at this table
is going to disagree with that.
So why would we not let the locals enforce
the laws that are being broken?
And if that number that's in here is wrong,
let's find what that number should be,
whether that 20 cents is too high or too low or what have you.
So let's have that discussion.
But I'd love to hear some feedback from you
why we shouldn't let local law enforcement
have that authority.
Well, I agree.
Yeah, nine.
Well, I think I understand your argument.
The question is why do we not want to let them?
I don't think they want to.
I don't think they want to be weighing trucks.
And so that's just the, that's where I'm come,
that's the position I'm starting.
I don't think they want to be weighing trucks.
I don't think your PD or your sheriff's
want to be weighing trucks but that's pretty much the basis of my argument. I do understand
your argument about the roads at a county level. I know there's only so much money to go
around in rural Georgia or we'll just pick any county and so many times the county commission
is the commission of roads and bridges. Roads and ditches is how we say in South Georgia.
So what they do is they get $600,000, maybe they could get a G dot spec, you know, quarter
mile out of that, but, you know, Commissioner A wants a mile in his district, Commissioner
B wants a mile in his district and so on down the roads, they take that $600 and they
just put binder down on a road and they go 12 miles with it or whatever it is.
I think that's also a basis for the problems that we're having.
We're building roads to a substandard spectre.
But I have to address the fact that we've
been running 95,000 pounds for three years.
And before that, when we had a fire in 13,
we ran it for, I don't know, at least 18 months,
maybe longer than that.
And before that, in 2007, we ran at 95,000 pounds
for however many months.
I mean, this is not unprecedented.
We're asking for 88,000 pounds.
It puts us in line with these other states.
And I know that the feds don't let 88,000 pounds
ride on there, but if you get a permit out of Savannah,
you can haul 100,000 pounds.
And I know that's 1% of the trucks that've got that permit,
but I don't know how many trips they're making,
but there's a god awful lot of containers coming out
of that port at 100,000 pounds.
And they're riding on that interstate.
They're riding on that state road,
and they're riding on that county road,
because they can only go from pick up to delivery.
And I would submit to you that there's not a truck anywhere
in the state of Georgia in this nation
that is doing anything but picking up and delivering.
So you got 100,000 pounds running out of the port
with 6,000 trucks with the permit
for however many trips a year running from the port
to there's no interstate that runs from the port
to Stewart County Company in Wakecross, Georgia.
So this is not unprecedented.
We do have the operating at these higher weights.
We have operated these higher weights.
I'd just like to say that if the locals
are asking for these things,
I mean, maybe we give it to them,
but how many calls do you get Senator Gooch
about a speed trap somewhere and getting speed trap?
And the next thing you're gonna be getting is
like so and so's set up on the corner
or their weigh-in trucks.
I don't think that lens is conducive to this environment,
but I mean, that's just my opinion, particularly if they're
not asking to do it.
Now, the fine structure, I want to assure
that we get the bad actors.
I like the bridge fine and the weight fine.
Let's just pick, can we pick two out of three?
Maybe go do away with the axle fine
and go whichever one's the, you know,
whichever one's gonna be the most severe.
I'll go with that, but the structure,
and I'm just reading it, I'm a little bit confused
and the chairman probably be able to clear it up for me.
Can we have, can we just have two fines?
And I definitely wanna get the bad actors.
If they're hauling above the weight, let's get them.
You know, I've heard conversations about, you know, some sort of technology you can put
on bridges that weighs them when they cross, and if they're heavy, fight them.
I think everybody in this room will say that you got bad actors.
We need to address the bad actors, but the whole industry shouldn't suffer for these
bad actors. Okay, go ahead. Representative Makes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to the local law enforcement, Mr. Leader, I think we have
to reflect on where these roads and bridges are. And as we've heard from testimony that
overweight trucks may seem to turn over, if in the area where I live, if a log truck is
stop to be weighed there's nowhere for that log truck to pull over except for on the shoulder
of the road and when that happens it is my sense that if we've had a rainy season and
it is slick we're going to have a truck out there rolling that truck back over and
picking the the the wood up simply because there's nowhere for that truck to stop except
on the road to have the scales pulled out
if that's what the local law enforcement
or local law jurisdiction is doing in order to do that
and do it safely.
I may be coming from the opposite direction
with a tractor that takes up the whole road
and that makes us have a whole nother predicament
of trying to get around with nowhere for them
to stop safely to be weighed.
And from the ones that I have seen on, they're usually on a four-lane road, they're usually
pulling to a turning lane, particularly on a highway 84, they'll pull into a turning
lane that's in the middle, or either, it's where they always are when I see them anyway.
I very rarely see them on a two-lane road unless there's a designated spot where they
have, they can't get off the road.
Yeah, can I say something real quick?
Well, I understand, but I want to be fair to everybody.
I just, for everybody in the audience, I want to,
I just want to make you understand what it means
to everyday Georgians who are out there trying to make
11, because I've reached out to people in my district
Lager's farmers.
And so we're appearing, you know, we're trying
to implement public policy.
But for a, for a small family login business,
that's going to move about 60 loads a week.
They're going to turn about $1.7 million in gross revenue.
That's gross revenue.
That's total money coming into that business.
The difference on an average 50 mile haul
for that small family business
between 84 and 88,000 pounds
is $154,000 a year on a business that doesn't turn
but $1.7 million in gross revenue.
And keep in mind that every state that touches us
in terms of Agon Forestry, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee,
North Carolina, South Carolina,
There are either 4 to 6,000 pounds more than we are.
So when you look at in terms of competitiveness and cost
and everything else, that is a policy that we have
at 84,000 pounds is a true cost.
And $154,000 in a small business is a difference
between being able to pay your fuel bill
and make your payments to caterpillar financial
and everything else.
I just wanted to, that's for the total business, $154,000
year on what would you have about you probably have three four trucks on that
maybe five yeah is that about right that's a hundred and fifty four thousand
dollars on a total gross of one one point seven million dollars that is a real
number chairman dollars all would you did you have since you wanted to add you
wanted to ask her speaker absorb the conversation a little bit here but
I think if, respectfully, if somehow the forestry and ag industries are such that business
inputs are not paid by the consumer, I would like to know why my grocery prices cost
what they are.
Why timber prices have risen the way that they've risen?
I would actually argue that we've seen enough data over the last three years to say the business
input costs 100 percent are passed on to the consumer and then some. I know a lot of people
who are in these industries and none of them are starving. In fact, they've had some of the
best years they've ever had. Primarily because the cost of to the consumer have increased
so much. So I think that perhaps if you look at it from the minutiae, you may
I might optically think that I'm not seeing a change in my bottom line, but somewhere
that's getting passed on to the consumers.
I don't know where that is, but I think that we can all agree that we've seen cost get
passed on to the consumer.
I want to dive into the MCD thing, though, because leader Gouge made a comment that last
weekend there was one enforcement agent on for the entire state of Georgia.
If that is true, and I've no reason to believe that's not true, I think we can all agree
that's absolutely ridiculous.
So, and to the whip's point, if the locals don't want to do the enforcement, they don't
have to do the enforcement.
There's nothing in this bill that is making them do enforcement.
So if our pushback on enforcement is, well, they don't want to do it.
Well, nobody's making them do it.
But for those people who do recognize that there's a problem, I don't know the two lane
versus four lane thing.
When I come back to the way my brain works is I think about the inverse of every argument.
And so if the two-lane enforcement is a problem for locals, it's a problem for MCD.
If it's only happening on a four-lane road, that means that we're running, you know, who
knows what's happening on the two-lane roads.
I think the thing that concerns me on the enforcement and fine piece, and whether it's what we
heard under testimony from the Forestry Division, don't make us submit our weights when people
come into our facilities or whether it's this,
if don't let local law enforcement enforce it,
it seems if I peel back a layer of that,
what I'm really hearing is we're running our trucks
overweight, and we just don't want anybody to know it.
And I can understand the Barney 5 argument
if we don't want a bunch of Barney 5s running around
and pulling truckers over at harassed them.
I don't think that that's what they just want.
But I think the thing that concerns me,
as I've listened to this conversation
over the last 90 days, it kind of seems like what's inferred
is, yeah, we want to tell you that we're complying with the law, but don't make a sure
you that we are.
And I think that that's a problem.
As it relates to the family farmer and the 1.6 million, and we've got a lot of 1.6 million
dollar small businesses in this state, a lot of them.
And I think that all of us, my business partners here today, and he's out here probably
wondering what in the world I'm doing down here, talking about truck ways.
But they all have to live by a set of guidelines that does not force everybody else to subsidize
their business, hopefully, right?
So and I've said this before, on the degradation of the road thing of the asset piece, this
is my primary concern, the commission would marry testified that it takes a 20-year road
down to 12, the Georgia Tech gentleman I think said it takes a 20-year road down to 18
years.
So there's some discrepancy.
But what everybody will tell you is this does increase the rate at which I'll rose to
deteriorate.
So I'm concerned about us coming here and saying, well, we're just going to do one more
thing where we make everybody else pay and we have a firm might ask you, why are we just
doing two industries?
Well, I can't all these trucks run this way and I don't have a great answer to that question
to be perfectly honest with you.
But this is an unfunded mandate to the local governments, whether it's 10% or 40%, whether
it's the 18 years of the 12 years.
This is an unfunded mandate.
And I said this from the well, I said this in committee.
We have underfunded infrastructure in the state for far too long.
We have had surpluses in this state and have not dropped the dime of them that I can tell
into infrastructure.
We see our surrounding states that yes, they allow more vapes, spend a heck of a lot more
money on infrastructure.
Billions of dollars more in the state of Florida went into infrastructure this year than what we put in
What I called the commissioner. I hope he doesn't mind me saying this
I said commissioner. I said how much is this gonna cost you? He said 500 million bucks a year not counting the bridges
As I word or the bridge is gonna cost. He said I don't know 10 billion
So okay, let's talk about the 500 million if we could find you 500 million
How much does your heartburn go away?
Any paul is to give it some thought and he said it significantly goes away
And what I appreciated about that is he was being open to the reality of recognizing that
we want to move freight and people and products through this state.
But it seemed like an intellectually honest approach to where my take away from that was
this is largely a funding issue for the commissioner and we've done nothing to address the funding.
And quite frankly we don't know if we're going to be able to get a bill passed here that
will address the funding because I know that some of the things that have been
talked about will not pass this chamber. Maybe even either side of the chamber.
If we try to do what Colorado does, I don't think that gets done, right, on the
per package fee. So I think, and I wanted to clarify, I think the 95,000
pounds happened with a permit over the last three years. It was not every
strike. It was not every forestry trucks. I think that's important to note.
I don't know what percentage of them got permitted. The last thing I'll tell you
guys is I whipped my committee a week and a half before the vote on y'all's bill and
it you had about three yes votes.
So that's what I went to leader Gooch and we got together and had conversations on this
and I found what I thought was a pacifier of sorts that allows the industry to at least
continue to do some things that they want to do, doesn't do everything that they want
to do.
that if we take some of the things out of here that were sales pitches from me, from the well,
I think the number can change, I think, faster than any of us realize.
So I want to make sure that I'm open to some of these things that we've discussed.
I think let's have those conversations, but I also, you know, we've got five and a half hours to get a bill.
So I want to caution us that we find the right things.
So, if I can, can we talk about the radius thing, and I'll just step back, because 75 was
in our bill.
You mentioned 150 whip, but then I think you said most stuff comes in under 100 anyway.
So can you just help us understand why 75 doesn't work if 150 is the, what's the, help
us understand your thinking?
Currently, as my understanding, you can drive a commercial truck without a CDL license
from the farm 150 miles.
And so I'm just looking for some parity in the law there.
We could probably jump back to 120, or maybe it's, I think it would just be cleaner if
it was 150.
I mean, I'm just throwing that out there, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, for the clarification of that.
So a producer that owns their own vehicle,
their own commercial size vehicle, a semi,
that is not for hire, they're hauling their own products,
may haul their farm products 150 mile radius from the farm.
That coincides with the Federal FMAT program
that allows you without a CDO license for scale CDO license,
you have to have a class E, I believe it is,
but it keeps that consistent across the southeast.
What's current law?
150 miles.
For the 5% allowance?
Yes.
Well, I got one question on the road degradation thing.
Why do y'all think the federal law is 80,000?
And can we agree that we think those roads are better made than most county roads?
Absolutely.
So, help me bridge the gap there in my mind.
The bridge the gap, why it's 80 and why it's not 80 elsewhere?
If those roads are yes, obviously the feds have an interest in commerce just as much as we do.
Their tax rates are higher, so they want to see more commerce because they tax it more than we do.
So why are they built better than ours?
No, not why they built better, but if they're built better
than they're at 80, how are you guys comfortable
as it relates to the road degradation?
Oh, OK, I get it.
So in committee, the conversation we had
about degradation of roads is not wait.
It's volume.
How many times you drive over this thing?
So I would say that the construction of those roads
are at the spec they are because I say 75
halls more than Highway 82, stay Highway 82 or stay Highway 1. There's just a lot more
people using 75, 95, 10. Then there are using these, you know, these, I guess, the Ancillary
Roads, 82, 1 County Roads. I think that's probably why they're built to the
suspect that they are. And to the wait portion, there's more trucks, more trucks
period. Most of the trucks coming out of Savannah are getting on one of those, 95, getting
on 75. Anything coming through the state from Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, all of
those the rows they're traveling. So I think it's volume is why they construct that, constructs
rows like they do, but it's clear that they do allow for more than 80,000, but it's just
permit on a permit basis and so the question that I had was and didn't come up
till afterwards there was testimony that said 6,000 some trucks got that
permit for a hundred thousand but I don't know if that includes interest state
travel so if somebody leaves New York City and they're running down 95 do they
got to get a permit to drive through on I-75 or I-95 I don't know the answer
So those containers are coming out of the port, they have a seal on them.
They're not allowed to be opened until they get to their final destination.
They're indivisible loads.
It's not going from one warehouse to the other through Henry County.
So we talked about every truck has to stop somewhere, yes.
But some of those trucks stop multiple times throughout the state.
These containers coming out of the port have a clip on the back, they're locked.
not to be reopened again until they get to their final point or they'll be shipped.
They'll be taken off of that trailer and then bust them up and then out to distribution
centers or where they're going.
So those are 100,000 pounds and there are less than 1% of those on the road at any time.
We have that data to show that.
So those interstates are built.
I showed a core sample in the chamber.
You have about an 18-inch slab of concrete and asphalt and another 18 inches of base
under it compared to a county dirt road that has about two or three inches of
asphalt compared to a state road so we can't asphalt in a state route maybe
four to five inches so we have to invest in our infrastructure what did we put
in our budget today we just passed a budget tonight in the Senate we put
zero dollars in there for bonds for bridges for the last seven years we've
had House Bill 170 in place we've added a hundred million dollars almost
every year. We didn't put one dime in the budget this year, guys. Not one dime.
And so that shows the community that we're not really serious yet. We have to
get serious about it. So you're point about the less than one percent of the
hundred thousand pounds. The question I was, oh, so that's, I would, I think that
is trucks originating out of Savannah. Yeah. Primarily. Or bronze. Or bronze.
Or bronze. Wherever. That's correct. My question is, if you get, if you go into the
port of New York and you travel in Florida with that seal container. I don't
know if that happens. Does that, does those trucks have to get a permit from
Georgia to run down 75 or they get that seal container? I think it falls
under the RP program, which is the international road program that allows
them to follow that regulation through Georgia, but I don't want to be quoted
on that tonight. So perceivably possibly possibly we have more than 6,000 trucks
that are running through Georgia.
I think that one percent is based on data
that the DOT has accumulated.
And I would assume that statewide,
regardless of where there's coming from Georgia
or the Florida ports, or going to South Carolina or wherever.
Well, okay, all right.
Well, I'll submit to that.
I think that those are those probably we originate in Georgia,
but there could be some loads coming from South Carolina
or Florida or whatever.
But does that answer your question that I was talking about?
I think it's volume.
It's based on volume.
And I recognize the problem is the weight on the axle
where the wheel touches the ground.
I don't think it's as much the number of trucks at a day
as much as is the direct weight.
I'm not an engineer, but we've had several discussions
with the engineers at our experts at the DOT.
And so we're asking how much more can a road take?
It's 80,000 pounds, too much, too less.
don't know, 100,000, where does it stop?
And so we have to rely on the experts
to help us with that information.
If we ignore the DOT commissioner and his staff,
then why do we even have them?
And so we have to listen to them,
and they're asking for help.
They're not saying we're not ever gonna do this.
I'm for including every industry
at some point in increased weights.
I'm not saying no tonight to Ag in Timber.
I'm saying let's find a way to increase it
for every industry in our state to make our state better,
economically and better competitive.
We need to talk about tort reform, too, Mr. Webb.
Maybe that won't happen tonight,
but that discussion needs to continue.
If we're going to stay on top of it,
we're going to help the trucking industry.
Listen to what they're asking for.
I have a letter in here.
They're asking for that as well.
Insurance rates are one of the highest in the country
here in Georgia.
So I'm fine to focus on these three issues tonight,
but the discussion has to continue after session.
I'm fine with also sticking to funding mechanism.
I know that the Chairman Hatchett
and Speaker Burns have both committed to funding.
And I think everybody in this room
understands there's a funding mechanism.
I don't think anybody has opposed that.
I think what we said is that the industry's growing,
and every industry like you said pointed out is growing,
we need to grow with them.
And if that means we need to invest a billion more dollars,
then we need to invest a billion more dollars.
And I'm for having a conversation
about how we find that billion dollars.
But I would like to move a measure here forward.
And so the devil's in the details,
I'd like to consider these few revisions.
If you guys are willing to move on some of these revisions,
I don't know how we do this.
I think we had a full-turted debate here.
Do we go get a amendment drafted?
and then see if we can strike a language and I'd like to make a recommendation to the
chairman. I'd like for y'all to give us your your final ask and then let the Senate committee
go and have a little time to talk and come back. Set a time to come back. It's 6.45 now.
We can come back at 7.30 or whatever time you wish and we can come back with the proposal.
But we'd like I'd like to hear what's your final ask is your final and best offer.
Mr. William, if I can make a suggestion,
I know they've got some very important business
to attend to in the house.
So I would suggest that I would suggest
that we reconvene this meeting
after that very important measure.
And I'll be well fed and probably a really good mood
and ready to have a good robust conversation.
I'm with you on that.
Mr. Chairman, does that mean that you're gonna be
even more open-minded after you eat?
You could be more robust.
Okay.
the answer is it depends, but I know the RIP is going to do this job over there and I
will be very grateful for it.
Well, I'm working as hard as I can over there.
Do you want us to submit you language or what?
Just tell us.
On these three issues, the 150 mile radius starts at 75, local law enforcement, and I guess
it defines.
I mean, a little while ago, I thought you said you were okay with the robust science.
Well, I'm not clear as how the fine structure works.
I like the bridge portion and the overweight portion,
but there's an axle.
Is there an axle fine in here somewhere?
It is, but it's equated to the dump trucks
to where you've got tandem axle dump trucks.
And so that weight is the equivalence
of the weight of the others.
Instead of gross weight, it's done by axle
because of the spread of the weight
along the surface of the road.
So it's not in addition, it's not second.
It's just, they had to weigh the dump trucks by the axle
and not by the way they were the 18-wheelers.
So it's an ore, not an ant.
And a load on any kind of axle without a lift axle.
So this wouldn't apply to a tractor?
I think the motor carrier division
would be the experts in the room to answer that question.
If we have anyone here, I would love to hear their response
to that, or G-dots.
Let me get some clarity on that.
But what I would say is that if, you know, and this is just my opinion, and I'll defer to the chairman of the committee from once the bill came and obviously the author, my opinion is that we go with the,
we go with this section one here, start on 34, and then you have a bridge proportion here.
Where's the bridge portion? Is it two on this on the next page?
Is it two 58 line 58?
Is that a bridge?
Of course you have a bridge.
We can talk about this later.
That's one of the bridge.
That's it.
So my ask would be the 150 miles, the bridges on line 58, 369.
My ask would be the 150 miles.
It would be the going away with or extending the sunset date, maybe three years.
five years I'll take whatever you'll give us and this can we go with one and two
versions one and two here without section are you on well excuse me I'm on
section one you know mine is 34 so that's from going from 88,000 to 93,000
pounds, the fine would be 5 cents per pound. If you weigh in excessively, over 93,000 up
to 100,000, then the fine gets increased to 10 cents per pound. And then of course, if
you go over 100,000, anything over 100,000 pounds, you would be fine 20 cents per pound.
Now, that goes back to the 80,000 pound base.
That's not included in the variance. That's right. No variance. So when our bill section
one with the five sand, that included the variance, but the others did not.
But I would argue that if you get pulled over in downtown DeLonica and you're breaking
the speed limit, local law enforcement won't write you a ticket for the first 10 miles
per hour over.
There's a state law that prohibits that.
You understand that?
But if you go 11 miles per hour over the speed limit, the speeding ticket's going to
be for 11 miles per hour over the speed limit.
It's not for one mile per hour over the variance.
So this is written in the same manner.
So if you got a truck that weighs 110,000 pounds, do you want them to pay a fine or not?
Yeah, I think we do.
I do.
I just want to go back to work.
Can't we just find them under line 40, though?
Equator of greater 100,000 pounds would be 20 pounds per excess weight.
It's 20 cents per pound.
That's what this bill does.
Well, I like that.
Can we just strike the B and C out of there and not have them find it all for another first
two?
Well, isn't the fine 20 cents per pound for excess weight over a liable weight limitation?
So instead of going back to 80, you would say go back to what, just for the excess over
100?
You know, he's saying a strike line is 42 through 55.
You should get rid of the axle.
You should get rid of the axle.
That doesn't give me heartburn unless there's a significant reason why that's in there.
That's not language that we particularly...
I mean, if we can find them under this first section and then we can find them and that's
with their hull on the road and if you can find them under two I think you're
thinking that these are stacked fines and they're not so this is a different
way of the MCCD measuring the weights of the truck okay well if you pull up on
a scale on a regular scale at a mill it's going to weigh the entire truck if you
pull up on scales out on the road they're going to do it by the axle that's
how they compute it and so I think that's why that language is in there but we
need to verify that before we get it.
Yeah, I would ask, I'm open to the idea one way or the other, I would, this just seems
more simplistic to me in the last 30, 40, 41.
It's a lot simpler, but you would have to have the total weight of the truck.
If you're pulling them over on the side of the road, you're not going to have that capability
because they have to weigh each actual weight.
And so that's why that language is in the car.
Okay, I see.
43 through 55.
And then I want to make sure that this bill, the new bill,
it's not repealing the $84,000 for all the other industries
that are hauling currently.
That's correct.
All right.
And then the sunset would apply to the fines and to the underlying.
The sunset, the way we drafted this bill only applies
to the excess 5% variance.
This, the local enforcement and the extra fines were
forever in this bill until somebody with more wisdom than us
changes in the future.
Nothing forever.
Nothing is forever.
Well, can we, if we're going to take this thing all together,
can we just make sure if we're going to sunset this increase
that we sunset the fines and go back to the regular
fine, fineing mechanism?
I mean, it seems like we're taking on the good and
Sunset and the good but we won't keep the bad with the we're punishing the people that are
Breaking the law. Well, I'm actually catch that we actually do catch with that one inspector in the whole state and to the
For a weekend chairman, but all of those all point. I'm all for getting some more MCC folks out there. I mean me too
Is it possible to eliminate the sunset forever?
Should take it completely out of the bill now. He's he was saying
three years. I understand what maybe five now you're saying I think that would
kill your business. Yeah listen we as I said the thing is we can extend this to
every industry if we can get to a point next year to where we have a
freight logistics plan that has some funding in it Chairman Jasper here I've
talked about this for many many months now we have to have everybody in the
room working with us saying this is important maybe for these industries so
So, if we make this permanent just for these two industries and no one else, what does
that say into the rest of the businesses in our state?
I think it's wrong to carve it out just for two industries.
If we're going to make it permanent, let's make it permanent for everyone, but we can't
do that until we solve the funding issue.
Come on, Pindy.
You agree with that, Chairman Jasper?
I'm sorry, what number are you, Chairman?
Five.
You were in deep thought.
You were figuring this out.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
I've looked at that I've noticed Germany is on line 17.
We're talking about the attainment area.
That attainment area needs to be defined at Bill signing.
So it's, it is, it is defined.
Well, I mean, just that we need to locate it.
It's defined by, it's defined by state law and by EPD
based on the nine attainment areas of the state.
Well, that, well, that will move over time.
We're under, we're under the limits now,
since time.
So you want to make it larger or smaller?
Well, we're going to do that, we're going to include the attainment area.
Let's lock it in on what it is today.
There's issues with, as you know, with population bills, they're unconstitutional.
So this was the language that we worked with, Jim, at Ledge Council,
that we came up with, that we believe is defendable based on the emissions issues and the...
Can I interject?
Which leader is it not true, though, that the federal government could change what...
It could change the PPPs or whatever else and it could be the intent of this body to have those 15 counties be
You know the and what's what we call I'll keep what we call the containment area, but not a tenement. Yes
But a federal regulation could change that from 15 counties to be in 40 counties overnight. Well, that's not the intent of this body
Well, I suppose that's possible. I think it's so far outside the realm of probability because our emissions are actually lower
than the federal standard that caused them to put that
in place altogether, so that whatever's been done
in advancing automobile emissions has satisfied
the Feds requirements, so there'd be no justification
for them to expand it beyond where it is,
because we're talking about that.
That's a good question.
We can go back there.
We can lower it.
Senator, you could also come back in January
even if you're feeling that part of the bill.
This is a one-year extension.
We're not talking about two years from now.
We're talking about three or five.
Well, even if we went to 36 months, we got work to do.
Oh, absolutely.
I agree.
This is a mix you have in you.
I think we just need to put something together and get it to you and see where we go.
Meanwhile, I'm going to do my job and see if we can get some measures moved.
I would recommend it.
I want to be on the record of saying that the outcome of the measure that we're going
to be working on, I hope it doesn't change the negotiations
that's in this table.
I'd like to go back to Chairman Dolezal's recommendation.
We meet after this bill of interest passes.
We have a little time for supper.
We can come back, the three of us will talk,
and the three of you guys will make a counter offer to you.
And if we agree, we can go and draft the legislation
and get it ready.
And then what do we have to do at that age?
We have to put it on the table.
It has to be on the, it has to be on the desk for two hours in the Senate.
I'm not sure what the rules are, but in the Senate it's a two-hour rule.
So we need to get moving on that within an hour when it's starting to wrap.
It doesn't look like there's a lot to change, so I think the structure of the bill can basically
stay in place, move some numbers around, and some of the things we agree on at our next
meeting, and then we can get this done quickly.
So we're going to reconvene, but hopefully we have some language on our side, but we reconvene.
So let's run a timeline here so we can have it here at 8 o'clock.
8 o'clock sounds good.
But we have to have it on the desk of the cent two hours before we have to have it on
the floor no later than 10 p.m.
I would be nervous with 10, 8, 30, let's just do 8, 30.
Sure.
9 o'clock it in the latest will be it.
Okay.
All right.
Sounds like we got something to work towards.
We'll see you in eight.
Yep.
All right.
You
