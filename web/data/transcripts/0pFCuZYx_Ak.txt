Is there any of the gentlemen has moved that this house insists on its position on Senate
Bill 6 and that the Committee of Conference be appointed?
Is there objection?
The chair here is none of this house has insisted.
The chair appoints as a committee of conference.
Representative Blackman from the 146 Representative Williamson of the 115th and Representative
Burns of the 159th District.
The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 42.
Senate Bill 42 by Senator Mulles, the 53rd.
Gute to the 51st Harvest and the 15th,
and others to be titled an act to amend.
Code section 20, 14, 33,
the official go to Georgia, Antietta, relating indicators of quality of learning and individual
schools and school systems, comparison to state standards, grading schools and schools
systems. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Education, that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to present the bill.
Mr. Speaker, folks, I present to you House Smith Senate bill 42.
This is coming to us from the Senate in regard to behavior reporting and transparency.
What this is doing is creating transparency for school discipline reports posted on to be that these discipline reports be posted on a school's website.
Also that they'd be available in printed copy to community members at no cost.
But in addition, these reports, discipline reports will also be reported to the Governor's
Office of Student Achievement and the Department of Education.
It doesn't change the standards, doesn't change the scoring, it just requires more transparency
on behavior and conduct reporting.
This portion of the bill in particular is supported by educators first, GSA, PAGE, DOE, and others.
And the other part of the bill, I know a lot of people care passionately about this.
This is what is called the Dexter Mosley Act.
I tried to get Chairman Jasper's to call this the T-boat Bill and he's too much of a Georgia
fan to call it that, but essentially what this does is this is an issue we've been talking
about in this capital for many years and we're moving forward to allow home studies students
to participate in grade 6 through 12 extracurricular activities. On certain
conditions, number one, they must take one qualifying course in their home
public school. That could be online, it could be dual enrollment, it could be face
to face. That student must register for the course at least 30 days before the
first day of school. They must participate in the public school for which they
are zone, so they can't live in one zone and participate in scholastic
sports or what-have-you or extracurricular activities in another school district.
They must meet all the normal requirements on participation, age, academics, behavior,
conduct, zoning and so forth. And by the way, physical examinations and vaccinations,
all of that's handled are enforced by Georgia High School Sports Association,
who is in favor of the bill anyways. And in addition, if any student withdraws
from the public school, that student is
ineligible to participate in sports
for a 12-month period.
And the reason we're doing this is because
if someone is a public school student,
for example, not a homeschool student,
and they withdraw, they can't just
automatically go back under this program
and play in sports and so forth.
They have to sit out for 12 months.
I just want to thank Chairman Rick Jaspers
for his work on this.
After years of work with the GHSA,
the homeschool community.
I know many of us have seen the two homeschool ladies and others that we've heard from in our constituents and
It's it's a great step forward and mr. Speaker if there's no questions, I will yield the well
You have some questions if you care to yield I'll take a couple questions, sir
Recognizes Chairman Martin to your left for a question
Chairman Carson, you owe a full question?
Yes, sir, go ahead.
This is a friendly question, I believe.
I do want to inquire a little more deeply
in the issue of a student athlete
withdrawing from a public school to be in a homeschool
and being prohibited from playing.
It is not true that the Georgia High School Association
has transfer rules, and my concern would be
if something happened that we can't look into the future
today in this capital that caused a student athlete to need to go to homeschool.
As long as they were still in the school district from whence they withdrew, would they still
have to sit at 12 months?
As long as they're meeting the requirements under this to still enroll in one class,
as my understanding is that they would be able to qualify.
So if you deal with one more question, so I can look at it more deeply here, but it
is not specifically causing them to miss a year simply because they moved from public
school into a homeschool, only under other circumstances whereby they would otherwise
not be eligible.
That is my understanding.
Thank you.
I'll take one more question, Mr. Speaker.
recognizes representative Wilson in the gallery to your right.
Will the gentleman yield?
Yes, thank you.
Is it not true that Dexter Mosley was well known in House District Gatie and was a champion
in our community?
That's absolutely correct and to my friend's point, Dexter Mosley, God rest his soul.
His wife is out here in the hallway advocating for this, fighting for this, fighting for
her children. He unfortunately passed away several years ago, and this is just a great
time to honor him and to give all homes to do, homeschool, study, students, and
opportunity in Georgia. Thank you for that question. And his wife has been here
every day this session. And not just, yes, sir, not just here, but not just here
for two hours, more like sometimes 10, 12 hours at a time. So she is very
passionate about this but all over Georgia we have people that are passionate about this
yes sir.
It's a well drafted bill and I appreciate you bringing it.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, I'm sure there's a number of other legislative business we can get to and
at this time I'd just like to yield the will.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair here's an un, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none of the committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?

Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill?

And the clerk will unlock the machines.
I have all members voted, I have all members voted, I have all members voted, I have
of so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 42.

We're going to read the caption to Senate Bill 215.
Senate Bill 215 by Senator Walker, the 20th, the 11th, and others to be entitled to
an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 in Title 31.
The official go to Georgia annotated
relating regulations of hospitals
and related institutions,
so as to authorize certified medication aids
to administer certain medications
this bill ever referred to the community
on Health and Human Services.
That committee recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative LaHood
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members.
The Committee's substitute to Senate Bill 215 is a workforce bill for the long-term
care providers.
And so it does two things.
First, it allows certified medication aids to be employed by skilled nursing homes.
And second, it allows or requires the Department of Community Health to authorize certified
nursing aid, employer-based training, and other type settings such as assisted living, personal
care homes, private home care providers, and other long-term care types.
It's a great bill.
It'll do a lot to help the strain on the workforce in this industry and the department has been
part of this conversation and all the other stakeholders so I appreciate your
favorable consideration and Mr. Speaker I'll take questions if there are any
if not I'll yield the well looks like you do have one question do you yield yes

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption.
the Senate bill 107.
Senate bill 107 by Senator Strickland,
the 17th Carpatrick, the 32nd,
due to the 30th and others,
be taught on an act to amend Article 12 of the chapter three.
Of Title 20, the official go to Georgia and Teddy,
relating to post-secondary education grants
for foster children and adopted children.
This bill I refer to the committee on higher education.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Reeves to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Senate Bill 107 is another great example of the synergy that's going on in this capital
of what the House, the Senate and the Governor's Office have all been doing, working together
to try to create a better environment for foster children here in Georgia.
And what Senate Bill 107 does is that certain qualified foster children will be eligible
to have their tuition and fees waived if they attend a technical college of Georgia.
This is a great policy as we try to help the students that have had some of the most
difficult roads imaginable that they have educational opportunities and to develop skill
sets and have meaningful careers.
The bill also incorporates a bill that was previously filed by a representative, Sandra
Scott, that would allow any person that qualifies as a homeless student under certain
qualifications would be able to receive in-state tuition as opposed to out-of-state tuition.
And the bill also is going, it has an amendment that the Speaker-Predtem Jones is going
to speak about that relates to waiving GED fees for foster kids as well.
Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to yield for questions.
You have no questions.
Great.
Are we yield the well?
I'm sorry you do have a question.
Okay, I yield.
Do you yield?
Chair recognizes representative Scott in the gallery for a question.
Yeah, that's the gentleman you I do. I
Would just like to say thank you to
Representative Chuck Martin for his hard work in
Dillan to see and getting house bill seven
Incorporated into this bill because he had worked very hard to make sure that the homeless and false
Care students bill for the opportunity and I was just like the personally said thank you
Representative mine. Thank you, Representative Scott, and I'm sorry, I'll yield one more.
Chair recognizes representative Cannon to your left for a question.
Thank you, do you? I do.
I just wanted to ask since we do have a member of this body who came out of the foster care system,
have you discussed this bill with that legislator?
because I certainly have and she has expressed her interests and desire and gratefulness for this important piece of legislation.
Obviously, this is a sit-it bill. I know that I have discussed with Representative Thomas some of the stuff that we've been doing.
I'm not sure if I've discussed this bill directly with her, but I certainly appreciate her input and support for foster care issues in Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well.
Gentlemen is yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
We have an amendment.
The amendment is brought by the Speaker Pro Tem of the House.
It is the Jones Amendment AM 490026.
Chair recognizes the Speaker ProTIM to speak to her amendment.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This just adds a provision on page seven that the students who meet the qualifications
for tuition waiver would also be eligible to have all of their tuition and fees and the
test cost to obtain a GED at the technical college system of Georgia. I've
spoken with them and the cost will be relatively minimal but for many
students that are older or that age out many of them do not obtain a high
school degree so getting a GED may be their first step on the wrong of moving up
and being able to take advantage of the other areas
that are contained in this good bill.
And I would appreciate your favorable consideration
with that Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well.
Clerk will read the Jones amendment.
Jones of the 47th offers the following amendment, A.M. 49, 0, 0, 26. This amendment has been printed
and is on the tables behind the chamber.
Is there any objection to adopting the Jones amendment? Is there objection? Chair, here's
that is not and the amendment is adopted.
Is there any objection to adopting the amendment
offered by the committee on the rules?
The chair here's none.
The amendment is adopted, is there any objection
to adopting the committee substitute as amended?
The chair here's none, the committee substitute
as amended is adopted, is there any objection
to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill,
Chair, here's none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of the bill
will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock
the machine.
I have all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine
On the passage of Senate Bill 107, the eyes are 166.
The nays are zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority
is therefore passed.
Earlier today, this house failed to give Senate Bill 260.
The requisite constitutional majority, the House, reconsidered its action.
It is on the general calendar and it is called at this time.
The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 260.
Senate Bill 260 by Senator Harper,
the seventh of being titled an act to amend code section
2, 12, 80, the fiscal to Georgia,
annotated related to promulgation and adoption
of rules and regulations and sharing of information.
So it's to exclude certain soil amendments from regulation.
Chair recognizes a representative,
Dickie, do you wish to come to the boil
or from your desk, I recognize you.
Mr. Baker, my motion.
Excellent.
Yes, it's your motion.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dickey
to explain the bill.
Thank you, minister Speaker.
We're going to try this one more time.
I appreciate your reconsideration of this bill.
It's a good bill that's been a lot of work put in it
by our committee and by other members of this house.
And we'll really take care of some work of process
to take care of some issues that's been in the past.
And these solar members are not some things
that have been brought up to attention in past years.
And this bill really gets the Department of Ag
and engaged in EPD and others to monitor what is being put down,
to monitor the amount that's put down
with these sole nutrient tests.
And I think this bill really sets the right balance
to take care of these much-needed solar amendments
from a critical industry of hours
to be able to be disposed of
and put on as fertilizer
and those type of things on some ground.
And so without saying too much more,
I think the bill just really finishes up
some process that we started last year
and we'll finish up with this bill.
And I think it's very reasonable attempt to do that.
And so I'd ask for your vote for this bill 260.
Thank you very much.
I'll yield a well, Mr. Speaker.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well,
is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor
of the passage of the bill?
Will vote aye, those opposed to vote no,
and the clerk will unlock the machine.
What purpose does representative Mary Frances Williams rise?
is it not true that this bill still contains language that would not allow communities to
have setbacks of more than 100 feet.
And is it not true that the distance of 100 feet
is comparable, is the same as going from our well,
the lectern at the well, to halfway into the hall.
That's the distance of 100 feet.
I think everyone's had plenty of time
to read the bill and be familiar with its content.
What purpose does representative Maynard rise pursuant to code one three three.
I'd like to be excused from this bill, please.
Lady has that right and the journal will so reflect.
All right, as all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of Senate Bill 260.
The eyes are 92, the nays are 69.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Okay, we're going to be at ease for about five minutes so that you can go out to the back
of the chamber, the back of the gallery and the back of 341 and pick up the latest supplemental
rules calendar and the bills.
