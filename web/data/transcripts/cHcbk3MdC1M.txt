----------
Good morning, everybody. We've come to order, please.
Morning. We're going to ask Chairman Hawkins to open us up with the word prayer here this morning.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Please bow your heads.
God, we come to you today and pray that we have the eyes to see the best in people, the
heart that forgives the worst, a mind that forgets the bad, and a soul that never loses faith
in God.
Thank you for this name.
Please guide us in our deliberations.
Amen.
Thank you, sir.
Okay. Those who would be presenting bills today, some bills have not been reported out
of committee yet. So if your bill is not on the blue sheet or the yellow calendar, then
we'll need to have you come back in the morning at 9 o'clock. So if your bill is not on
the blue or yellow sheet, you don't need to be asking for that today. If it is, we'll
be glad to hear from you.
Okay, let's go ahead.
Yes ma'am.
Good morning, members of the committee and Mr. Chairman.
I am asking for favor consideration of HV7.
It is the first bill on the yellow sheet
and it is an amazing bill.
Let me tell you about it.
HV7 gives a $4,000 income tax credit
for a graduates of a workforce readiness program,
I employed in full time in high tech jobs in our rural counties, so it was in rules
last year and thank you to Chairman Blackman for working with me on this last two years.
So I asked for your favorable consideration of HB7.
HB7, okay.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Representative Glaes.
Good morning, colleagues.
Good morning, Chairman.
I come before you asking your favorable consideration
for House Bill 583, which is on page six at the top.
The LC is 394705S.
And this bill is in reference to adding a second-free
license plate for veterans who are totally disabled
or have a level of disability.
So at this point, they only have one,
and we're asking for a second one for their spouse
or for a second car.
Again, thank you for your favorable consideration.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
Don't see any questions.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee
On the yellow sheet, I bring to you HB718.
I'm working from LC number 590125.
And HB7186 to make the first week in April of each year,
women's golf week in Georgia.
Thank you, and I ask for your favorable consideration.
OK, I don't think that one's made it out yet.
should be on the yellow sheet I was told but I don't know. 718, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
members committee. Third page 13th one from the top House Bill 351. I'm back to ask for that bill
again today. This is the EPD Department Bill and basically all we're doing we're just clarifying
the permitting process for solid waste landfill whose responsible what the public hearings
need to be held. It's the prevent future lawsuits with the state and local save money.
Okay we do have a question Jim Smith. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Does it determine you?
Yes, I do.
This is the project of work that has been going on for over two years and I know EPD and
you have been working with all the various interested parties and a lot of the bill just
clarifies what needs to be done in the process to follow but there's a good buy-in around
the state.
There is a need we need to do this and I thank you for your tenacity and sticking with
it.
Thank you for helping us perfect the bill.
Thank you.
Thanks, sir. I'll see you more questions.
All right. I have another one on the third page.
16th now for the top House Bill 371.
And basically what we're doing there, we're just raising the maximum allowable that we can
appropriate anyone year from 300 million to 375 million for capital outlay projects.
This is a maximum we can appropriate less than that.
It doesn't take effect until 2027.
two things that has caused the need for the increase.
One inflation, it had been increased in 2007.
And also Pre-K was added to the FTE fund
in the last year as well.
So that's the two reasons we need the increase.
And I appreciate you for the consideration.
Okay, you don't have any questions.
Thanks, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Yellow sheet page five house bill 449.
This bill, Georgia's one of five states
that does not regulate private water companies
in this bill,
looks to do that on companies
that use surface water for distribution.
I'd be glad to answer any questions.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Kim Yard.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee.
I have two bills, 484, half bill 44, half bill 45, they're on page 4, near the bottom,
half bill 44 lasts for the Georgia law books, which are the tan books in some of your office
rather than black code books to be published in either hard copy or digital forms.
Maintaining a digital option can improve the accessibility of these importance as it
because more difficult to find a cost effective publisher.
Any questions?
No, see any questions on that?
Which other ones?
All right, 45.
All right.
485 is this and the annual code revision bill,
but it's something that the Ledge Council worked on during the last season.
It actually helps clean up the code in a number of ways,
foreign lines and modernizes technology as some of the federal references and the Georgia law.
For instance, change in the names on certain things like the note child left behind
lack act which has sent the name there which you to succeed at. It also addresses items
in the code which has been deemed unconstitutional. Also, it addresses items that have been funded
that have been on the book for some time.
And any unconstitutional portions of the law
that require further debate or major pilot discussions
were not included in this bill.
And I want to thank the legislative council
for the work they did on this
and the House budget research office for their assistance
and ask for your favorable consideration.
Okay, don't see any questions on either one of those.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you.
That's a new shocker.
Good morning. Thank you, Chairwoman and members of the committee. We'll be coming off the Blue Sheet House Bill
369 on the Blue Sheet and I'll be asking your payroll
for help on this one
Something to pitch the glasses on
House bill 369 basically what is doing a safety measure
For the ice cream trucks to have a little bit more signage on the back and on the side
Because not too long ago in October 23. We had a child here in Fort County
was killed by a driver that was going around the ice cream truck and we're
just asking to slow down a little bit and as a paramedic that's one thing you
don't want to roll up on the child in that situation. Thank you.
You don't have to say any questions. Thank you sir. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee.
I bring you HP 494s and the top of H5, LC 394, 607.
And what this bill would do, it would require both head drivers to have, to be covered by some formal financial responsibility,
which provide the ability for them to replace the damages for our abilities and account for accidents that they cause or
that they may be in.
There are 25 states that have, that require more payouts to have some type of insurance and that includes states like Alabama, Mississippi,
Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, Utah, Colorado, that just to name a few that require more payouts to have some type of form of
insurance. Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Carr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to present House Bill 529 today. It's
on page 6 of the yellow sheet. Third from the top.
This bill is called the Georgia Online Automatic Renewal Transparency Act.
Mr. Chairman, virtually everybody in this room has been shot or surprised by an automatic
renewal on a subscription.
They've gotten more prices and shot up dramatically, and virtually everybody in this room has
been incredibly frustrated with the difficulty of getting out of some of these subscriptions
at times.
The Georgia Online Automatic Renewal Transparency Act addresses the challenges with automatic renewal subscriptions.
And it was passed unanimously out of committee and I think it's a very popular bill that crosses every line.
Okay, thanks sir, don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you Mr. Chairman members of the committee today I bring to you this on the yellow sheets page four house bill 429
This is a result of a constituent calling me and asking me why they are still paying taxes on a motor vehicle that was purchased prior to 2013
This is a 2010 car and I said a good question. Let me see what I can do for you
So what it does is, it removes the annual advalorem
with a birthday tax on motor vehicles purchased prior
to March 1, 2013.
Anything after that is not taxed currently,
so this would put them in the same treatment category.
And I would ask for your favorite consideration
and answer any questions you may have.
OK, no questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
What we do have a question too.
Big protein has questions.
Since 2013, is that when we passed the birthday tax?
And so they've been paying at the warms for what or they've been paying avalorn for this will be the 12th year that other car owners do not pay
So now we're saying you paid enough and yes, that is correct. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, sir. Thank you. Okay, that takes
Representative Wilkinson. What was the fiscal note on that?
There is no fiscal note. There is no impact to the state for this. So it only impacts the locals. I will add this. There was a request from ACCJ to do an opt-in, but that would be a tax increase because that money would go to the state. So this is no impact to the state at all.
money that the locals are receiving. That is correct. For all cars that they've
been paying taxes on for 12 years. Thank you. Plus, thank you. Thanks, sir. Okay,
that's everybody on the wall. Before we get to the members for your request, we
need to have a little housekeeping I'd like to do. I'd like to recommit House Bill 397 back to
Governmental Affairs who hear a motion and have a motion and second is in opposition.
Okay, it's back there.
Okay, any members of the committee have requests?
Chair McGree.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members on page six, the fifth one down, House Bill 593, which is really a local bill,
But it has to be a general bill, a probate judge, a provide for a nonpartisan election.
Thank you.
Okay, I don't see any questions on that.
Thanks, sir.
Chairman Newton.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Also on the yellow sheet, bottom of page three, House Bill 341 is an insurance plan as
a department bill from the Department of Insurance in an effort to find out where the
gaps are and insurance coverage.
Some people that work for small businesses, 10 employees or less are often not able to afford a full-fledged plan.
This allows the employer to contribute an amount and let the employee also pay an additional amount to get an individual coverage of the Georgia Access Program where over one and a half million are already on it, but this allows the employer, once again, businesses 10 employees and less.
Okay, I have a question.
I had a question.
I said, this is, you mentioned a department bill
that went through ways and means.
Is that right?
Correct.
Is there a cost to the state for this?
I'm sorry, yes.
It is a $600 per year per employee tax credit
to those small businesses to encourage them.
They have to spend at least $1,200,
and many or most of them spend $3,000 or $5,000
of employer contribution, but this does give them $600 per employee as a tax credit.
It is an incentive to encourage people who don't have a plan already to add one.
So state tax payers would be subsidizing $600 per person for their health insurance?
Right, maximum of $5 million a year.
Okay, thank you.
You have a additional one.
Okay, it's over on page six at the top of page six on the yellow sheet is House Bill 526 it regards historic
renovations of historic properties recognizes that with commercial properties
ADA and other standards require a
A lot more in-depth
Work and this allows allows but does not require a local government to not just give eight years of a property tax abatement plan
but up to 20 years. It's not mandatory, it's just permissive, and there's no state funding involved.
Okay, don't see any questions. Thanks, sir.
Sure, no you didn't see.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There are two on the yellow sheet, and I know we may need to talk
about them further as we get closer on the trail, but I thought I'd put them in the purview here.
So HB567, which is on the yellow sheet, and it is on page six about two-thirds of the way down.
This will authorize and regulate the practice of teledenistry in Georgia by Georgia licensed all health care team members.
That's the first one.
No, see any questions on that. What's your next one?
And the second one is on page 7, 6 down.
It is HB677, which will deal with the challenge that we have of some of our children who are stuck in care situations in our hospitals
hospitals as well as residential treatment centers, it will allow a team to come
together quickly, the match team which already exists and try to help fund proper
placement for them as they are released from care.
Okay, I've seen any questions on that one, okay.
Chairman Hawkins, did you have a request?
Yes, Mr. Chairman, it's on the yellow sheet page seven, top of the page, HB629.
Sure brought to me an issue that they were running into.
We passed legislation last year on AEDs and elementary schools, but back in the original
legislation which involved only high schools in years or years ago, it required that the
program be evaluated and certified by a physician. In modern times, they found
that not to be necessary because it does allude to requirements on national
standards. Also, the AEDs have changed so much that now you just place the AED
on the patient's push and button and it tells you what to do. So this would
I would take a load off, Chaua.
Okay, you don't see any questions.
They had Chairman Blackburn.
You have one?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
I know Chairman Newton has already mentioned 8-3-41.
We missed a date change on that.
And I know that we've been focused so hard on working on some of the language
and they have been so amenable to it that we would like to recommit
and then get it back to you with that date change if it all possible.
possible. So I would move that we recommet 341. Send it back to two ways of means. Okay,
we recognize for a motion for that. Is there a second? Is there any opposition to sending
that back 341? It's back. Okay.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, on the third page next close to the bottom, House Bill 393 is the
safer cycling in Georgia, brought to me by one of my high school seniors and supported
by most of the cycling closer.
Tell us the number again.
393.
393.
Okay.
to where they can turn right if no one is coming and they look without having to stop because that would happen.
Speak right into that mic. They're having trouble hearing that.
393 on the bottom of page three.
Next to the last one is the Safer Cycling in Georgia Act brought to me by one of my high school seniors
and supported by the bicycle and clubs across Georgia.
They are trying to be allowed like they tell me they can already motorcycle people can do.
people can do to turn right if there's no one coming or in the back and they are
pedestrians blocking. So they don't have to slow down where and are less likely to
be hit and we'll reduce the number of accidents.
Okay, don't see a question. Thank you, ma'am. Chairman Stevens.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page four, the Yellow Sheet House Bill 382 allows we have a drug
it's coming to the market before we're back in session so that we can put it on our annual drug
update. This allows them to move it from a schedule one to a schedule probably two and allow the
board to use us emergency powers until we can get back in session and put it on our drug update bill.
Okay, don't see any questions on that. Okay, on our calendar for today, I believe we have
17 propositions that are on the debate calendar for today. I think that'll keep us busy for a while.
So all we're gonna do this morning is have a hearing and I suspect we'll all need to get together later on in the day and have another little conference
So y'all have a good morning. Thank you
