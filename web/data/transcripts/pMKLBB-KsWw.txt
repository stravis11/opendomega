TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. Thank you for being here. I'm Senator Kenya Wix District 34. As
a retired Army officer with 30 years of service to this nation and now as a
Georgia Senator, I feel deeply responsible to speak on the issues that strikes
our core of our democracy and the values we all share. In light of the recent
deployment of the Georgia National Guard, let me be clear. Not only is this
This misguiding is unconstitutional, dangerous and inconsistent with the very oath that every
service member has sworn to uphold.
It dishonors the service, undermines the Constitution, and erodes the trust that binds our communities
together.
I have served this country for 30 to 3 decades.
I wore the uniform because I believed in the promise,
the promise of liberty, of opportunity for all.
I have seen the weight of the sacrifices
that has made by the soldiers and the families.
The uniform should be never used to intimidate or divide.
It should be used to only protect and serve.
Let me end with this.
The strength of the American has never come
from turning the soldiers against our people.
It comes from defending the Constitution,
protecting freedoms, standing for what's right,
even when it's difficult.
I will continue to oppose the efforts
of misusing the National Guard.
And I urge my fellow colleagues, the fellow citizens,
to do the same.
Our democracy demands it, the value commands it,
and our people deserve it.
Thank you.
I will be followed by a representative Eric Bell.
Thank you, Senator.
Today seems surreal.
It feels like we're living in a movie, or the seventh season of FX's American Horror
Story, The Colt, where the fear and the manipulation tears communities apart, centering around
the cult terrorizing residents after Donald Trump wins the 2016 presidential election.
But this is not fiction, this is an ironic hour.
I'm coming to you not just as a legislator, but as a son of Georgia, as a veteran who
has pledged his life to defend this nation as a believer in the dignity of every human soul.
The threat to before us is not just on foreign shores, but from within, with the reckless
deployments of the National Guard against its fellow American citizens.
Make no mistake, this is not about public safety, is the erosion of American freedom and
the sovereignty, is a portrayal to the very people who stand to fit the bill, you, the
The tax payers already in California, the courts have ruled against the unlawful deployment
in DC awaits a new lawsuit and now let's just see what happens in New Orleans, the
tide of justice is turning and Georgia must stand on the right side of history.
If the National Guard indeed is to be deployed across cities in America, let us dare to dream
that perhaps they will come not with rifles but with rations.
Let them come not to enforce
Lordeering, but to feed the thousands of Americans crushed beneath the weight of poverty and denied economic mobility.
If the guard is coming, maybe they can build homes for the thousands who suffer from mental illness and are forced to scavenge our cities and

massacres that are committed every day by oddly a person connected to the

ring. The garks are coming. The oligarchs are coming and at this point they are

setting black against brown, yellow against white, and the red against the blue,
the destitute against the poor, the poor against the middle class and the middle class
even against themselves while they laugh to the banks. Let's be clear, members of
the armed forces are not only bound by conscience but by law. Under the uniform code
92 of the military justice service members are bound to a bound to duty to
debate, lawful orders, but also bound to refuse unlawful ones.
The Newman Burke Principles affirmed that just following orders is no defense against crimes
against humanity.
The Department of Justice requires the U.S. forces comply to the rules of law and must
refuse parties to the patient and unlawful acts.
To turn American troops against American citizens are violation against principle and law.
no service membership he compelled to participate in such.
Republicans, Republican leadership,
Georgians of every walk of life, faith, veterans,
and active duty and law enforcement,
remember you're oath to the Constitution and to the people.
Not to capitalism, not to the false promises
of a authoritarian regime, but to freedom.
Remember, resistance is the American way.
The revolution was fought, not to exchange
one set of masters for another.
But to ensure that no king, no tyrant, no dictator
can trample on the dignity of free men and women.
Governor Kent, I will work with you.
I will work with every Georgia Republican
with the conscience to resist this federal overreach.
Remember, your back and your knee
cannot bend unless you bend it to fascism, racism,
authoritarianism, sexism, disguised as patriotism
and religion.
stop the deployment.
This is not Nazi Germany, nor Stalin, Russia.
This is supposed to be America.
The land of the free, the home of the brave,
and right now freedom is looking a little thin.
This is Georgia, where we want to prided ourselves
on fierce independence, states, rights, local control,
not federal servitude.
If we refuse to bow to tyranny now,
then let's stand together and ensure
Georgia remains a beacon of democracy
in the age of rising darkness.
History of swatching, our children,
our grandchildren are listening.
Let us not falter nor be hood, wink,
let us stray or bamboozle.
DC today, Chicago and New Orleans tomorrow,
Atlanta Nix, let us stand together,
shoulder to shoulder, and declare one nation
under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
God bless America, God bless the USA.
I will now bring you to Representative Derek Jackson.
I stand before you, alongside my colleagues, fellow military veterans to address a matter
of profound constitutional and moral importance.
We are witnessing a troubling overreach of federal power, one that threatens the very foundation
of the Republic and most importantly the safety and well-being of our citizens of our state.
The federal government potential deployment of National Guard in our streets, with or without
the will of our state government, constitutes a direct violation of the principles to
have long governed the relationship between the federal government and the states.
The Apostle Committatus Act of 1878 is not a mere suggestion, it is a law that prohibits
the use of federal armed forces as a domestic police force.
This is not about being anti-military.
Once again, I remind you that we are military veterans.
This is about respecting the sacred and distinct roles of our soldiers and our law enforcement
officers.
Our National Guard members are citizens first and soldier second, trained to defend our
nation from foreign threats.
Their training is not for crowd control or domestic law enforcement and placing them in the
position will portray their trust and put both them and our communities at risk.
The governor of this state asks Commander-in-Chief of the Georgia National Guard has a solemn duty
and an explicit authority under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution to oppose
the federal intrusion.
The 10th Amendment states, and let me be absolutely clear, the powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states
respectively or to the people. Public safety and law enforcement are unequivocally reserved
to the states. When the federal government attempts to supersede the governor's authority,
it is a flagrant violation of this bedrock principle of federalism. The people of Georgia
should be outraged and deeply disappointed that our governor, Governor Kim, is not exercising
his commander-in-chief responsibilities according to his oath he took for this office.
His primary responsibility is to the citizens of this state, not to the political agenda
of a federal government such as Project 2025.
Governor Kim has the constitutional power to refuse this federal request.
It started off with 75 now as 300 brave men and women going to deploy.
Once he has failed to do so, he is betraying his oath and the trust placed in him by the
people that he was elected to serve.
Let's be absolutely clear about the pretext for the use of the National Guard deployments.
This justification for such a drastic measure is often an unproven, manufactured crisis,
fictional, deceptive, if you will.
We are told that our cities are out of control, the crime is rampant.
However, let us examine the facts, specifically in our state's capital.
As Atlanta shares the similar profile to Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, all are large
cities with a black mayor.
Let me be clear, Atlanta is not a city on the brink of collapse.
In fact, the crime rates are moving in the right direction.
According to data from City of Atlanta and other sources,
Violent Crime in Atlanta has significantly,
significantly gone down in recent years.
Point number one, Violent Crime overall was down
for the third, straight year in 2024,
hitting a new historic low since 2009.
Homicides in Atlanta have gone down substantially decline.
One report says 25% decrease in homicide in 2024 with another stating mid-year of this
year 30% drop compared to previous year.
Property crime also a significant reduction.
One report states that the property crime down in Atlanta is 13% this year thus far.
report states the property crime is down prior to pre-pandemic levels. The
trending is going in the right direction with right leadership. Again, let me
be clear to the folks in the White House. Atlanta is not a city and Georgia is
not a state that requires military occupation. Our local law enforcement is
more than capable of providing public safety. They are trained for that. National Guard
are not trained for that. The current trends continue to approve year over year. To use
a National Guard in this context is to manufacture a problem where one does not exist and
it escalates the situation that already improving. The current misuse of the National Guard
across the United States is a dangerous path we are on.
It is an attack on our constitutional structure,
a disregard for the sacrifices of our brave men
and women in uniform, a failure of leadership
at the highest level at the federal and state government.
As a candidate for governor,
the people of Georgia deserves better.
We deserve a governor who will stand up and fight
for the sovereignty of our state and the safety
of our citizens, not one who will apply or simply acquiesce to the federal
overreach. We must demand that our elected leaders honor their oaths and
protect the constitutional boundaries that have kept our nation free. And with
that, we open up to questions.
And do you have any other questions for the speaker?
Whenever the National Guard or any military force
is set on American soil, it's a pseudo-active war.
And we are not at war times.
So not only do I believe it's unlawful,
it's unconstitutional.
And it's a slap in the very face of American sovereignty
in which our founding fathers set out
to preserve many years ago, both before me and your ancestors,
probably set foot in this very land.
And it's our solemn swear as a constitutional officer
at this state of Georgia to defend that.
So before they're even leave the grounds of Georgia,
bring the troops home, let them stay here with their families,
where they can stay safe, and let's continue to make Georgia.
Or once it was, the number one place to do business.
But let's continue to make Georgia
and the United States the number one place to live.
And I will add, I mean, right now,
they ford deploy these national guards in Washington, D.C.
What are they doing?
They're picking up trash.
They mowing lawn.
That is not mission critical.
That is not part of the mission for National Guard.
When we deploy the brave men and women,
it is not for a beautification of landscaping.
So it is an abuse of power.
It is unlawful for them to do what they're doing
based on the results that we're seeing.
Our National Guard, our brave men and women
are actually doing.
I can't read Governor Kim's mind, but what I will say is this.
As I stated in my prepared notes, he is in violation of the 10th Amendment, and the only
reason why he is curry in favor with this current administration is strictly political.
as he knows that this goes against the mission of the National Guard.
He knows this goes against the scope and scale.
I mean, it's going to cost an average of $1.1 million a day.
And so here we are.
We are Governor Kim already said to all the state agencies,
we're going to freeze your money, but yet you are going to deploy National Guard.
Who's going to pay that bill?
Us, taxpayers.
And so he is current in favor with this White House,
and unfortunately, it is an abandonment
to what he should be doing,
and that is being a command and chief for Georgia.
Here I have a political daughter,
and I'm gonna remember to stay in that
as a top student for a top-of-the-line student
and as a chief, check out the bottom of the room
So the government cannot predict what's going to happen in Georgia.
We're in a hurricane season, for example.
And so if we have a devastated hurricane to come through and hit the rural parts of Georgia
as it has been in the last few years, we need the National Guard to be here already,
being ready to be deployed if need be.
300 men and women that he already turned over to the federal government.
He has no control over their operations.
Once he turned it over to President Trump until the President Trump released those 300,
he can't get them back.
And so again, that's the reason why I'm saying the scoping scale of operation, he's not
taken into consideration of the needs of Georgian, especially while we're still, as an example,
we're still in hurricane season.
Any other questions?
Thank you very much.
