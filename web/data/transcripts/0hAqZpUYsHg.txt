TRANSCRIPT
----------
On this day three of the session, we continue to learn what to expect during the legislative session.
Two of the lawmakers who will help lead what happens join us.
House Majority Leader, Republican Representative Chuck
Abstration of Mulberry, he was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2013.
And House Minority Whip, Democratic Representative Sam Park of Lawrenceville,
his first election to the House was in 2016. Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
Thank you so much.
We're going to talk about priorities.
So leader registration for a couple of years now, the speaker has talked about giving
Georgia residents a break when it comes to property taxes.
It tells us if this is the year, that's going to happen.
Well, thanks for having me, Donna.
Affordability is the big issue this year, and our speaker has outlined the elimination of
the homestead property tax state wide, and that legislation is to be introduced.
legislative session, Georgians are paying so much in property taxes, property values continue
to climb.
And so for their homes where they live, the elimination of that property tax would be
a huge savings.
Okay.
We'll get more and a affordability in a moment.
So talk about that when it comes to taxes with the Democrats.
We're certainly interested in looking forward to seeing what the Republican caucus will
be proposing when it comes to property taxes.
I think leader of stration mentioned a key aspect that I think there needs to be more
focus, which is these increased valuations, these increased property values in which the
underlying cause is the lack of housing supply.
Over the past seven to eight years, we've seen the median average price of a home go from
about $200,000 and more than $450,000.
So I think while looking at property tax reform is important, we also have to do what we
can't expand the supply of affordable housing.
Let's move on to education, always bigs at the capital every year during the legislative
session.
What are you talking about with the Republican caucus?
So childhood literacy is a major issue for this legislative session.
Speaker John Burns outlined in his speech this morning that a top priority of the state
house is literacy, particularly looking at the third grade reading level.
When only one third of kids statewide are reading proficiently at grade level, that's
That's a major concern, particularly with the spending and focus that we've had in education.
In the classroom literacy coaches who can assist teachers in following a curriculum, which
is proven to be effective for those kids, is so critical for the long-term development
of the child, for ultimately issues like workforce development and career readiness.
Yeah, so that's a big thing with the Republican caucus, with the Democratic caucus.
With respect to education, the Democratic caucus, we really look at it from a spectrum from
cradle to career.
Certainly, there will be bipartisan support to ensure that we're investing more in literacy.
But with respect to K through 12 education, I think there's some disagreement between
the two parties.
Of course, over the past few years, we've had a big debate over vouchers, in which just
last year, we sent $140 million toward private schools and vouchers that really undermine
especially rural school districts
and their ability to teach kids.
The last piece I'd mention on education is student loan debt.
You know, Georgia now ranks third
with the highest average student loan debt in the country.
And of course, Senator Nann Orrick did an excellent job
over the off session in doing a study committee
on needs-based aid for higher education,
and which hopefully we'll be able to move
something on that issue as well.
And she'll be on the show later.
So any more, anything more on education you wanna mention?
I think education is the top priority right now.
I think that the ability for every child in Georgia
have to world class education
and for us to meet those standards for reading
are issues that I expect will really advance this session.
Okay, let's get into health care.
Let's talk about the fact that Democrats have
for a while now pushed for Medicaid expansion.
Do you expect to do that again?
We will be introducing additional legislation,
including obtaining a fiscal note
to understand the true impact in cost, a full Medicaid expansion, but of course, this
is not a pilot.
There's more than 40 states that have expanded Medicaid.
It has lowered the cost of private health insurance premiums because we're expanding
the pool, lowering the risk.
And of course, right now, healthcare prices are skyrocketing in large part because of
the federal government and the Republican majority, in which we're seeing healthcare
are premiums for those increasing by $1,000, $2,000.
Already about 190,000 Georgians with ACA plans
have fallen off.
And so it's a very, very concerning situation.
Especially when we're looking at tax cuts
that provide an average benefit of approximately $250
to $300, that's fantastic.
But if your health care prices are going up by $1,000, $2,000,
the affordability crisis continues.
So you'll expect some legislation in that area.
What about with health care with your caucus?
Well, a lot of issues have been raised, a lot to unpack.
I'll just say this, the affordability issues
is a major focus, accessibility and affordability
and health care, particularly rural health care access
continues to be a major priority of the Georgia House.
And there are many measures
which we've worked to advance in that area.
I know that as we're discussing the cost
that Georgians are facing in these expensive times,
certainly in response to the skyrocketing inflation caused by policies out of Washington,
D.C. over the past few years, we're now in a position where we can, I think, actually
address that with tax relief, with insurance premium cost relief, with the study committee
that we've had this year legislation coming, and with reducing costs for first time home
buyers to be able to afford that first home, build long-term wealth through home ownership.
I know the speaker also talked about trying to increase the workforce in the health sector,
you know.
Absolutely.
So there have been new educational programs open across the state over the past few
years, training for health care workers so that we can meet the demand.
Certainly, as we have a population that requires additional health care workers.
Okay.
What else would you have on your plate?
I would say, you know, with respect to the health care
workforce piece again, certainly support the speakers
focused on expanding the workforce.
There have been multiple studies that say that full
Medicaid expansion would create 30,000 additional
health care jobs in the state of Georgia.
So I think the best way, if that is a speaker's priority,
is to, you know, work in a bipartisan manner
to expand Medicaid for Georgia.
I just have to address that.
Right now, we're seeing policy out of Washington, DC,
talking about not funding commitments
that were made previously to states
that did expand Medicaid.
Georgia is in a terrific position financially right now
because of the strong fiscal leadership
of Governor Brian Kemp and the Republicans
in the General Assembly.
We don't have a huge hole in our budget
that other states are facing.
We actually have reserves that make this state
better prepared for any financial uncertainty
which may happen in the future.
Did you want to add to that?
Absolutely.
I think we have a historic surplus right now
in which we're simply sitting on it
rather than investing in people.
You know, I appreciate the governor's interest
in building out a highway to billion dollars
in which I think the ground would not be broken until 2030.
How fantastic would it be if we invested 1.8 billion dollars
in the health of Georgia's today?
I'm expanding access to health care,
I'm expanding access to childcare.
I think there's a lot the state of Georgia can do,
but unfortunately under the current leadership
we haven't done that yet.
Okay, let's talk about any other priorities
that we haven't talked about that you're looking at.
So tax reduction is a major focus.
Over the past few years, the General Assembly
has reduced the income tax by two tenths
of a percent each year, $800 million savings for Georgians.
And there's a proposal to do that again this year,
actually bring the income tax rate below 5%.
That's in addition to the property tax relief
and a real focus on reducing insurance premiums.
That's healthcare insurance premiums, auto,
mobile, homeowners insurance.
We've actually seen three carriers
since the passage of legislation last year
to reduce rates and additional carriers
are coming into the state.
Ultimately, more competition is going to drive down costs
which will help all Georgians.
Okay, anything else do you want to add?
Data centers, I think, is something
that we should certainly closely examine.
You know, the cost of data centers,
you know, I think we're providing up to $470 million
and tax credits every single year in which 70% of data centers
come in Georgia would still remain.
OK.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to make that the final word.
But I thank you so much, both of you, for being here.
And we're certainly going to keep up with everything.
