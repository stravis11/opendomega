you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you But he also needs no introduction when it comes to tradition of him opening this house with words of encouragement for each and every one of us. Representative Mac Jackson has done that on a number of occasions over the last few years. And I can just tell you each and every one of you his words have always blessed me personally and encouraged me not just for this day but as we go through this session and Mac I'm appreciative of that. Thank you for that. He and Valerie actually lived, even though their churches and tenels, they live in San Roosevelt. They are and have been a very important instrumental part of that community for years. Mac grew up there. He was born in San Roosevelt. He's a homeboy. He's glad to be back home. And we all know that folks at home know you better than anyone else. I think folks at home know Mac's heart. He knows his heart for service to the good Lord and knows his heart for service to his constituents and his fellow men. So with that, I want to tell you Mac was elected in 2009. He's so you've been here a couple years, you know the ropes. And Mac also had to walk down 19 flights of stairs this morning to get here because the elevators were out in his building. And I said Mac, I'm not sure how to have been here if I had to walk up 19 flights of stairs. So a couple of challenges to begin today. A couple of great opportunities to begin this session. Mac and I'm also going to ask you in your words and in your prayer, if you remember we have a number of our members cross this room. Some of them are not here with us. They are challenged with some health, with some health challenges. And certainly families are too of this dear family, those that we hold close. So as you bring your words and your closing prayer, I want to ask you if you will specifically remember those as a whole. We know further ado our chapter another day, Representative Mac Jackson. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Good morning to everyone and happy new year. This is a new year that we're starting out and I'm just honored to be here today. As I was thinking about New Year's resolutions and things that you can change in your life, things that you need to get right because every new year we try and make some kind of resolution or some kind of change. And I was reading in the book of Matthew in chapter 25 and verse 31. And Jesus was talking to you and said, when the Son of Man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd devised his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left. Then shall the king send to them on his right hand, come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, prepare for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me meat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. Naked and you clothe me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we be a hunger and fed the authority and gave the drink. When saw we be a stranger and took the in or naked and clothe. Or when saw we be sick or in prison and came unto thee. And the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brother and you have done it unto me. And I thought that's easy. I can do that. I can visit the sick. I can feed the hunger. I can visit people in prison. Those are things that I can do. Those are pretty easy. But then in Paul's right into the Roman church in Romans chapter 12, verse 20, and he was talking about living at peace with all men. And he said, therefore, if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he's thirsty, give him the drink. So I thought about that representative Mitchell and wait a minute now. I can go and visit the sick. I can feed the hunger.

eat the hunger. But what about my enemy? Am I to feed my enemy too? Well, that's what Jesus said. And Paul said in his writing to the Roman church, he was talking about living at peace with all men. And he talked about your enemy. If your enemy is hunger, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him the drink. And then I read over in Matthew chapter 5, what Jesus said in verse 43, he said, but I say unto you, love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you and pray for them, which despitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be children of your father, which is in heaven. For he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good. He sends rain on the jazz and on the jazz. So if I want to be a child of God, if I want to emulate my heavenly Father's Paul told us in Ephesians chapter 1, to be imitators of God, to follow after God, then I've got to follow him in his word. And if he tells me that I have to do this, I have to obey the word of God because obedience is better than sacrifice. So if I want to change my life, then I've got to obey God and what he says to do in his word, even when it comes to people that persecute me, even when it comes to people who hate me, I can't be like them. I can't come down to that level. I've got to rise up to where God says I'm supposed to be. And in the book of Joshua, and in this new year, this is my resolution in Joshua, chapter 24 verse 15, and Joshua asks the question, he says, if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day in whom you will serve. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. So in 2024, I make no apologies for serving God. I make, I ask no one's permission for it because in the old church, I used to hear my granddaddy sing a song that says, you don't know you wasn't there. You don't know when and you don't know where. You don't know what the Lord has told me. And then they would turn over to another song and they said, I know the Lord will make a way somehow. Shall we pray? Father, we ask right now that you bless those families, those members mentioned by the speaker today, Lord God, touch them with your heel in hand, Lord God, raise them up, Father, in the name of Jesus, Lord. And Father, as we enter into this new year, this new session of the Georgia General Assembly, Lord, we ask for your blessing upon the leaders of this house, Father. We ask for your wisdom. We ask for your guidance, Father, as we do the business of this great state, Lord, that we do it unto the least of them, Lord God, that we make sure that we're doing your will and everything we do in 2024. And Father, we know when it's all said and done, we'll be able to give you the praise done in the glory for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen. Would you join me in the pledge of allegiance? A pledge of allegiance. Thank you. The Book of Mac. That was awesome. We appreciate that Mac. Thank you so much. Thank you. Doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors, members. You may greet the chaplain and have a photo with him. I'm sure that will be a keep-safe you'll cherish for years to come if you'll do that in the South any room. House will come to order.

Members please give the lady, ladies in the well your respect. She has an important recognition and remembrance here. Please give her your attention. Good morning and thank you Mr. Speaker. I would just like to say on Friday and far as the pocket was a shooting. And one person was killed. And the person was killed was my uncle grandson, my cousin. It hit my front door. And I stand here today to say to you all, gun violence is real. It is real. And it is time for Georgia to come together, have a conversation and do something about the violence we see going on every day in all of our community. There is no community left out of gun violence. It is real. My cousin, it was his son's birthday. On the day he thought his dad was coming home to celebrate. But his dad ended up in the morgue. He was doing his job. He was not in the streets. He was not running around. He was not a gang banger. He was sitting behind a desk doing taxes for a woman. And her estranged boyfriend came in shooting. He was doing the right thing. And in summertime he drove ice cream truck. And he was getting ready to dish here. And he was going to be in the last year working in that tax office. Because he was going to start his own tax service. But today they would get the body. And it would come home to us. It hurts. It hurts. I'm just going to say that no one, not one of us in here know the day, not the hour. It happened to my family on Friday. It can happen to yours tomorrow. Or today. All of us, every one of us, it can happen to us. We have a lot of gun legislation out here. And it's time that we come together and look at some gun violence, gun prevention legislation. George, we have to write the carer. Everyone have to write the carer. But now we need to think about it. We must do something. We must do something about the gun violence. I have a gun and I'm sure every one of you have one. I have more than one. But I use my gun sensible. I take the devices that need to be put on guns. And we need to do, that's what we need to do. We must do something to try to curb this gun violence. And I'm going to say it again. On today, but this weekend we were buried, Brandon Harris. Brandon Harris is his name. One one year old, one turn 11, like I said on the day that his father was killed. And he helped to more. It was a sad day in the given family. And I just like I said, thank you, Mr. Speaker. And we have a moment of silence and I yield the will. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the evening of New Year's Day. You may want to stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the new year's day. You may want to stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the new year's day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the evening of New Year's Day. The Polk County Community lost one of our most remarkable public servants with the passing of Polk County Commissioner Scotty Tillery. Scotty loved his hometown of Cedar Town where he served on the City Commission from 2009 to 2013. He loved his hometown of Polk County where he was elected to service commission in 2015. But more than either of those places he loved his family. His wife, Amory, his son's Russell and Clayton, his daughter's Julie in Megan. Scotty wore a lot of hats in our community. He called himself just a old dumb plumber. But he bought it new. He was much more than that. He was a finger printser left all over Cedar Town in Polk County. I loved going to visit Scotty at the hardware store, Crocrus Eddie Rand. I loved getting to interact with Scotty on projects in our community. Many of which have been completed, but many of which are still ongoing that will show the legacy that he left. He was the right hand of his brother, Rocky, who owns Polk County Public Service plumbers all across our state. And I know he'll leave a void in our city, our county, and his family. So while we keep his family and your prayers, I hope that you also join me in a moment of silence honoring his life. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative Kelly. All right. Let's see if we got a larger group. Representative Cannon, I see you're there. Representative Cannon, Representative Glaze, Representative Scofield, Lubton, Roman Cummings, Draper. I'll welcome up front. Happy New Year to all of you. Representative Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome back to the Capitol for the members who have not been here since special session. Even though that was recent, us members, we were here four days ago on Thursday, January 4th, to host a statewide public hearing on maternal mortality. We heard testimony from 25 Georgians in their professional and personal capacities. They provided us with solutions and stories about their loved ones passing away, themselves having a near miss, and their clients dealing with the need for legislative action. We want to be clear it is a state of emergency as it relates to maternal mortality in Georgia. We want to work with you on this issue. Therefore, we are compiling a report. We have been doing a request for documents for the past month, and you will receive this report this week in your office, on your desk, and in your email. We're asking you to please take the time to consider how you may support your constituents as of working on this issue. Because frankly, we all came from a birthing person, and now that they are passing away or nearly surviving birth, we must act. As we finalize a report, just want to be clear, the maternal mortality review committee has now put out the most recent report, which is this one. This comes from the Department of Public Health. You're able to get one of these from the government affairs of Department of Public Health. We're also asking that you consider wearing purple. We do have some purple arm bands that we will be bringing around to the chamber, and if you are interested in working on this issue with us, we would be happy to give you one of those. Because after we saw the movie Color Purple in its new rendition, and as you might have seen, the theme is of maternal near miss and maternal loss. We really feel like this color purple embodies how we want to talk about this issue. A COG, many of you might know, they are having their maternal health awareness day for the entire United States on January 23rd. And healthy mothers healthy babies is bolstering that by having their maternal health day here at our state capital on the 23rd. We just want to ask that you act on the 89% of preventable deaths that have happened in the past few years, and stand with us to combat maternal mortality. We just wanted to quickly say some of the organizations that testified so that you can have a better understanding of where we're coming from.

I know that for some of you all, this is not, this is a sad day, and I understand, like all of you all, you all would be wishing that the University of Georgia is going to play tonight in the National Championship game. However, I am here to offer you an alternative to cheer for the University of Michigan, Hail to the Victors. Thank you. There you go. I wasn't sure what that Hail to the Victors was about, but now I get it. It'll be a great game tonight. I'm looking forward to watching it. I'm looking forward to watching it. Representative Cummins recognized for an afternoon order. Good morning, everyone. During the recent special session, this house passed Resolution HR4X. The resolution was surrounded by politics and controversy. But out of all of the decisions that I have made since taking office, my decision not to vote that day left me feeling empty. It just didn't feel right. To give you a little bit of my background where I grew up, my mother's closest friend, who is my godmother still alive, is Mexican Jewish. My godson is Muslim. His mother and her family grew up across the street for me. And his grandfather was an extinct Emon who brought together Christians, Jews, and Muslims. But back in the 60s and 70s when the FBI were targeting black Muslims in New York, my parents had their male coming to my house. So when I say that I grew up with both sides, it really has been a part of my life. We socialized, argued, debated, and hung out with one another. We all did. So the only way that I could resolve this conflict was to completely take out the politics. Set aside and vote with my heart. So on December 7th, 2023, I logged my vote in the clerk's office to document my support of H.C. My statement makes clear that I support the Jewish people's right to defend themselves against Hamas. My statement also makes it very clear that I do not support the mass killings of innocent Palestinians. Now to my colleagues, Esther Panich and Ruhr Roman. Nobody in this room can truly understand the incredible pain, heartbreak, anguish, and fear you have both experienced since the heinous acts of October 7th, 2023. You both continue to have not only my support, but I'm sure the support of just about everybody in this room, even though it may not always feel like it. The terrorists who committed this act knew the pain it would cause, knew the pain it would inflict, and they knew the result of the consequences that would follow. In fact, they were betting on it. But I can't help but think about the fact that both of you found it in your heart to run for office in 2022. You each won your respective races, and you both made history when we was sworn in last year. Do you really think this is just a coincidence? At a time when national politics is tearing us apart, at a time when Georgians are struggling to stay together, here used to sit in the middle of the storm. I believe you are both here for a reason. I know you both have had difficult conversations with each other, and with us during the past several months since this incident. As you continue to advocate and fight for your families, for your friends, your loved ones, and your faith, I ask and I pray that you continue to have those difficult conversations. And when you can try to build those bridges for us, be the example in the beacon we so desperately need now. And I'll leave everyone with this. Yesterday I attended the Memorial Service for our dear sister Tish Nghisi. It was absolutely beautiful in healing to our souls. Thank you representative Al Williams and everyone who coordinated and participated in the event. During the service, the minister had managed us to put ourselves in each other's shoes when discussing, contemplating and making decisions. We've heard this saying before in many ways, and for many of us is natural. It's what lends itself to empathy for others. But during this time especially, it sage advice for all of us to consider as we navigate through this session, try to keep it together and serve the great people of Georgia. Speaker I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you representative and thank you members for your attention. You all know that if you remember we are a doc today, new policy if you will. It's in the rule book. We didn't bring the doctor of the day up front during the special session. But today I'm going to the part from that rule if it's okay. I'm going to have the objection. Let us let us. Chairman Carson introduce Dr. Kaufman. I'm going to let him do that because you'll understand just for the moment how important as we all know how important our traditions and our history are in this house and in this building. So with that, Chairman Carson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, I'd like to introduce Dr. Robert Kaufman. He's an internal medicine specialist and here in Atlanta with 38 years of experience. His father was doctor of the day for 35 years in the row. Every single first day of the general assembly session, his father was doctor of the day. Excuse me, Dr. Kaufman himself here has been doctor of the day of the past 35 years. His father was doctor of the day in the general assembly first day of the general assembly session for years before that. He currently runs the Kaufman Clinic with locations in Atlanta and Woodstock and with that, Dr. Kaufman. Thank you. It's quite an honor to be here. It's hard to believe I've been doing this for 35 years. I didn't think I was that old, but I guess I am. But overall the years, it's amazing that of all the people that have been provided health care through the doctor medical aid station. So it's an honor to be here. But really, the most important person is sitting over there against the wall trying to hide is Julia Mack. She's the nurse that runs the medical aid station and she's the most important person. So in fairness, I wouldn't hear last year. I was in Los Angeles. I wish I was in Houston. But anyhow, thank you all for all you do and it's a pleasure being here. Dr. Kaufman, thank you for your service. And if you feel anything, go to the NNC, Dr. Kaufman or Dr. Mack. And they'll take care of you at the NNND station. Nurse Mack, we appreciate you and your service to us as well. What a long, distinguished service to this house, with this father, and then with Dr. Kaufman. So thank you for being here. So for an afternoon order, we will recognize Representative Kendrick's and Representative Jasmine Clark. There she comes. Good morning. It's Dr. Clark makes her way here. So I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence. I'm sure everybody has heard of this buzz word. It is becoming a part of our lives. So myself, along with the Georgia future caucus for all you legislators under the age of 45, we are having a virtual event tomorrow from six to eight. And if you have not gotten that Zoom link, I will personally text it or email it to you. But it should be coming out another email today. But we're going to discuss some amazing issues. So if you're over the age of 45, you are also welcome to please join us as we have some experts from Georgia Tech to give us a primer for some of the things we should expect and look out for in an artificial intelligence. So hope to see you all tomorrow online. And if you don't get that email, I will personally text it to you. So we hope that you will join us as we discuss these important issues. Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representatives. I appreciate y'all long continuing work there. Representative Angela Moore is recognized for an order. Representative Moore. Good morning, colleagues. And happy new year. I wanted to remind you all, and I'll remind you again, that we are bringing the debiates from the east side of the A for the second year in a row. But the first time while we're in session here to the Georgia State Capitol for a wonderful session with them on this Wednesday, the 10th of January, they will tour the Capitol, have their official tour. They will have a wonderful Taco bar. Thanks to Chef Cam. I think it's Cam Kay catering. And they will learn about government and each and every one of them as they have done in the last two years has written a letter to the governor about their concerns. They are 16 and 17 years old. They are going to be the upper echelon of Georgia. They will be coming on the buses that have been granted to them by the county of Rockdale County. We're so pleased and so proud of them. And their Cattillion will be at the end of February of 2024. So when they get here, would you all please give them a huge welcome. Thank you so much. Thank you, Representative and ladies.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to call your attention to an email that should be in your email box from Friday and also there will be a refresher from this morning about a legislator only field trip to Mercy Care Clinic, which is right nearby. It is about 5 minutes away on Decatur Street. We had a similar trip last year where we got to learn about the workings of the clinic. The clinic for those who don't know who take care of the indigent community in particular, patients experiencing homelessness. So it's a great place to go to see the need that is there. And especially this year to see the ways that they've been able to use the money we were able to get to them through our budgeting process and to see what their needs are now. The tour starts at 12.30 so you'll have time to go to our lunch and learn beforehand. There will be a shuttle service from the capital for those who don't want to move their car.

Number one, we've had a good day. Thank you all for being here. Obviously on opening day of 2024 session. We appreciate it. And I know your constituents do as well. Thanks for your attention on participating in the opening preliminary. Business that we needed to tend to so we have another one piece that we will not get to the day and that is a scheduling of document. We are working with the Senate and it's very productive. There's nothing we need to worry about. But we're working with that so we'll be in session tomorrow. And tomorrow's session, the leader will make a motion in just a moment. But we're going to postpone the session until one because of the possibility of increment, increment weather. That's the word, bad weather. Then where I come from. You know, well. So we'll come back in at one PM tomorrow. And so if you are, I hope that works for everyone's schedules. So you know, the highest priority we have is for all our members to be safe. We don't want to take any chances in the morning with what the forecast looks like for the for that bad weather to be upon us. So with that. The House majority leader, leader, elseations recognized for a motion. Speaker, I move that this House stand adjourned until 1 o'clock PM on Tuesday, January 9th, 2024. On the majority leaders motion, I have to interject one thing prior that I forgot. I hope you will wear with pride. The pin to son your desk that identifies us as legitimate sworn in members of this house who are here to do the people's work. So hopefully you will all enjoy that and where we pride as I will. So on the motion of the majority of this House stand adjourned until Tuesday, January 9th, 2024 at 1 PM. All those in favor of that majority leaders motion will say, I oppose no. Yes, sir.
