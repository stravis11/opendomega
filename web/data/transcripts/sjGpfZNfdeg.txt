TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. I want to begin by thanking you all for taking the time to be with us this day to show up and to show out for Georgia's girl athletes.
I want to especially thank and recognize Jeff Graham from Georgia Equality and Bentley
Huggins from the Human Rights Campaign, and of course my dear friends from Georgia Winless
for coming and helping to spread the word about today's press conference.
We are here today not only to address the potential harm of our trans girls that SB1 seeks
to implement, but we are here also to name out loud the equity mountain that women continue
to climb in almost every arena, including athletics, even decades after Title IX enacted.
For those who aren't aware, Senate Republicans introduced SB1, the Fair and Safe Athletic
Opportunities Act, and this bill is making its way through the Senate.
To be clear, it is a bully tactic aimed at a minority community,
meanwhile, ignoring the reality that girls are cheated
out of real fairness each and every day.
What we know, what we continue to see and experience
firsthand, what we watch on our girl, our girl's face,
is an ongoing, unequal treatment of girls in sports
across our state.
My equal opportunities in Girl Sports Act, SB 41,
aims to address these inequities that
are still present in our athletic departments.
If we want to have a real conversation
about true fairness and true safety in Girl Sports,
about our truly level playing field, then let's talk.
Let's talk about how girls' teams
are made to practice late at night or early in the morning
when it's still dark outside.
Let's talk about how girls' soccer coaches
who work twice as long, averaging 20 games a season,
make one third.
That's right, one third the pay of football coaches
who averaged 10 games a season.
Or how about girls' sports teams
who are signed teacher supervisors, not coaches,
teachers supervisors with no coaching experience
because their pay and equity is so steep
that the qualified coaches won't take the job.
If we wanna have a real conversation
about leveling the playing field, then let's talk.
Let's talk about the severe lack of equipment,
provide it to teams, like the six soccer balls
given to girls, soccer teams, and South to Cav.
Or about the fact that teams are resorting to raising,
operating funds through athletic booster clubs
and student fees just to ensure that they have proper equipment.
Let's talk about the girls who never even
get a chance to play, because they
can't afford the fees at their public schools.
If we want to have a real conversation
about leveling the playing field, then let's talk.
Let's talk about the media who highlight the accomplishments
of boy soccer teams, but not the girl soccer team
that wins the state championship.
The attention that's given to football teams
far and above any girls' teams in our schools.
Let's talk about the medical professionals and the trainers
who are stretched thin, higher to serve all school athletes,
but common-deared by boys, football, and basketball teams.
Our female athletes are here begging
for real solutions to their real problems.
And to be clear, our trans girls are the farthest
from the problem that is actually
hindering our girls' abilities to play.
We've got a long way to go to leveling the playing field
in girl sports.
So let's solve real problems by passing SB 41.
At this time, I invite Representative Oliver
to come and talk as one who is a pre-titled non-athlete.
Thank you, Kim, thank you everyone for being here.
I am a pre-title 9 athlete from Druid Hill's High School.
I come to tell you about some of the good steps, the positive steps we have made in my political
career and why we need to move forward and not backward.
I also come to you on behalf of the Decatur Girls Cross Country team that is won the State
Championship two years at a row.
I remember when Republican women came together with Democrat women to make the Georgia high
school system of sports include fast pitch softball.
That was a very good victory.
I remember when Channel 2, Monica Pearson, did an extensive analysis of the fact that the
Georgia High School Sports Association had no women on the board.
We passed a bill and they have women on the board now.
Title IX changed the entire world.
When I was a four-year-letter person at Dr. O'Hill's High School, captaining my swim team,
I was good for a few months of every year in a sport.
When I went to Vanderbilt, I was invited to join the Synchronized Swim Team.
I think that we know that girl sports has come a long way, but we also know we know and
we must address the issue that it's not equal.
Evening the playing field is what we must do at this time.
The discussion that's focused on the non-existence of girl trans athletes is a total distraction
and a negative impediment to further progress.
Thank you for your attention today.
Thank you for your participation in some of the progress we've made and let's make sure
that we don't back up in 2025.
Thank you.
Hello, I am a born and raised Georgian and a huge part of my formative years was getting
to play sports.
Being on teams built my confidence and pride as a leader, having seen the power of sport
first-hand led me on the path of organizing and advocating for girls and women's sports
over the past many years.
While so much progress has been made in the realm of gender equity and sports, there
is still so far to go.
In my years of coaching, I hate to think about the time I've spent trying to fight for equal
opportunities for girls' teams when I could have spent that time practice planning or communicating
with parents and assistant coaches.
While conceptually organizers may know that girls and boys should be treated equally,
In the end, girls' teams are often scheduled in the worst time slot on the worst fields
or given lower quality equipment.
At first these things can seem small, but over time they add up, consistently getting
a little bit worse or a little bit less, tells our young athletes about how much they
They are valued in sense messages about how much our young girls should value themselves.
We have got to level the playing field.
We know that on average, girls who play sports get better grades, have better attendance
in school, and are more likely to graduate from college and even go on to graduate school.
In this specific time, we are in a youth mental health crisis that particularly impacts girls.
We know that sports are one of the best tools for girls to manage their anxiety and regulate
emotions.
We need to continue to have the fight for equality for our next generation of athletes to level
the playing field and ensure that we have equal equipment, equal coach salaries, and equal
access to facilities.
I'm so proud to stand behind this bill
as we come together to continue the fight
for girls in sports.

dropped a companion bill in the house
being carried by Representative Cannon.
Currently, girls and women in this country and in Georgia
are fighting to hold on to decades of hard fought progress.
Extreme lawmakers are stripping our freedom
to determine our futures, to decide what's best for our bodies,
and to simply be treated as equal citizens
under state and federal constitutions.
Now, those extreme politicians who are marginalizing girls
and women say they want to protect girls' sports.
If that were true, Georgia Republicans would get behind this bill,
which addresses the existing inequities
when it comes to playing time, access to fields,
and investment in sports equipment and coaches.
Title IX was enacted more than 50 years ago
to ensure gender equality in education,
which includes sports, yet disparities still persist.
Sports are more than just games.
They teach discipline, teamwork, leadership, and resilience,
yet despite these benefits, girls continue to be
sideline literally and figuratively
when it comes to athletic opportunities.
As previously mentioned, the girls teams receive less funding,
outdated and adequate equipment,
and are also forced to play on subpar fields
at inconvenient times compared to their male counterparts.
This isn't just an issue of fairness.
It's an issue of opportunity and empowerment.
Without equal playtime, young girls are discouraged
from pursuing their passion and the pipeline
that feeds future champions is weakened
before it even has a chance to develop.
What message are we sending when we tell young girls
that their sports are less important,
that their ambitions are secondary,
that their commitment and effort are worth less
than those of their male peers.
We cannot allow this outdated mindset to persist.
We must demand equal investment in girls' athletics,
not just in words, but in actions.
Because this is about shaping a future where girls
grow up knowing they are just as capable, valued,
and worthy of investment.
If Georgia Republicans truly wanted
to protect girls' sports,
They would stop their harping on the non-existent threat
by trans athletes and embrace this legislation
that empowers our girls.
Applause.
They would stop wasting our time and taxpayer money
on legislation bent on harming a very small, vulnerable,
minority group.
And instead, use that money to make, to add more equity
in girl sports and spend it on our young women and instead enact SB 41 which will help hundreds
of girls statewide have more equitable treatment in sports.
The fight for women's equality continues and I urge everyone to stand up for our girl
athletes because when we level that playing field, we don't just build better athletes.
We build stronger, more confident women ready to take the world.
Thank you.
This concludes the formal portion of our program that I do invite questions at this time
for any of our speakers.
Go closer.
Want you to come?
Yep.
Go ahead, Sam.
So to be clear, equity and girls' boards, it's not mutually exclusive to support making
sure that we level the playing field for girls.
But it is a false hearing to suggest that we are creating fairness for girls by eliminating
trans girls.
That doesn't make fairness.
This bill creates true fairness in girls' boards.
If we want to protect girls, then we need to make sure they have playing fields that
don't have holes in them, that they have access to equipment that fits them, that they have
real coaches.
Right now, today in Georgia, we have girls who play on the boys' teams, not because boys
are stronger or faster or anything like that.
They play on boys' teams because they have real coaches, because they have real equipment,
because they have access to real fields.
And so if we want to truly protect girls' sports, this is the way we do it.
It's with SB 41.
I think that we can truly make this a bipartisan bill.
So I began playing sports when I was just in the third grade and played sports all
all the way through college and went on to play
for the United States national team.
And during that entire time, the playing field was never level,
but we became acclimated to it.
We became used to it.
And moms actually stepped in to try to help with that.
So moms began to spend their money out of their own pockets
to make sure that we had uniforms that fit.
They began to spend money out of their own pockets
to transport kids to the games and things like that.
So moms have been filling the gap.
they've been trying to make it so that their girls,
their daughters have access to the playing fields,
have access to equality in the same way that their boys do.
But this should not be on the backs of mothers.
This is a Georgia job.
Applause.
Girls in Georgia deserve an equal playing field.
They deserve to be treated just as well as the boys do.
and their coaches deserve to be paid just as well
as the boys coaches are paid.
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
