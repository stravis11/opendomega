prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 134th House District,
the chairman of the House Rules Committee, Chairman Richard Smith.
Chairman Smith.
Thank you, Speaker.
Before you all start asking questions to the pastor as we're leaving, yes, he is my pastor.
I do have a pastor.
I had to tell a couple of y'all that up front.
You know, I was thinking about what I wanted to say, and I hope that all of you during
your life have someone that you can call a mentor, and in a lot of cases I hope that
mentor is someone younger than you, looks things that with a little different perspective
than you do.
And that's who my pastor, Jimmy Elder, he has pastor first, after his church in Columbus.
He's my friend, he's a mentor, and he's my pastor.
And with these individuals, like my friend Jimmy Elder, you develop a real particular
relationship with them when they presided over the barrel of your grandchild, but they
also presided over the dedication of a couple of your grandkids.
So you develop a real strong relationship with them and Jimmy Elders, one of those people
that I love and I consider my life a blessing that he's in.
So I'm going to start talking and give it to Jimmy, thank you.
Mr. Speaker, Chairman Smith, members of the House and friends, I'm honored to be here again
and to be your chaplain for the day.
I'm deeply honored to be here
at the invitation of Richard Smith.
He is indeed my dear friend, he is a parishioner,
and I always call him a statesman
because his spirit and his commission in heart
and commitment of heart is to do what's best for the state,
best for this house, and best for his constituents.
And I can tell you that from personal experience with him.
I am so grateful to be here.
You are a good people.
And you have done so much good for us through these years.
I'm grateful for who you are.
One of my favorite parts of my job
is my interaction with children.
We have a children's message at the morning service
and I always do it.
And I particularly enjoy doing that.
I have a number of stories that have
emerged from those times.
And I'll have to tell you that, as an aside,
the chairman Smith's granddaughter, Jolie, is precious
and is one of my favorite ones who comes down front
and sits right at my knee.
She is a precious part of my life.
My story from this morning, though,
comes not from my experience with the children,
but from a neighboring church in Columbus.
The associate pastor of one of the churches there
He got up on a Sunday morning and he was sitting with the children and he asked them a question.
He said, can you tell me what is the longest prayed and oldest prayer in the scriptures?
Now I'm sure he thought that they were going to say the Lord's Prayer.
And I'm sure he probably was more interested in finding the prayer of Aaron from number
Number 624-26, which is the priestly or the eronic prayer of benediction, but the answer
he received from one of the little children was something that really surprised him.
He said, what is the prayer that's been prayed the longest and is the oldest prayer within
Scripture?
And one of the kids said, I know, I know, and he said, what?
He said, for self-control.
And it just took him back completely.
He looked at the senior minister and he said, what do I do with this?
Self-control.
It wasn't the Lord's prayer, it wasn't the Aaronic prayer, it was for self-control.
The scripture says that out of the mouth of babes comes so much wisdom, and in this case,
that's exactly what happened.
If ever we have had our self-control tested, it's been over the last couple of years as
we face some of the most tense situations that I can remember.
We've been called upon to be disciplined and to make really good decisions.
You as legislators, along with our speaker and our governor, have led our state through
this COVID crisis in a most effective way.
I personally am very grateful for your wisdom and for the courage that you have exhibited
through this whole time.
Thank you for your wisdom.
Thank you for your guidance.
you for keeping us safe. Also, we've had to tap our self-control in attitude,
spirit and cooperation as we've gone through this journey. The question is, what
do we do now? Where do we go now? As we seem to have crested and seem to have
gotten to a point where things are getting back toward normal, where do we go
now. Things are progressing and sometimes struggling to get back to what that
normalcy is. As a minister I can tell you that I've seen that. And so what I did
is I went to the scriptures and I looked at what would inform that moment. And I
found in the ancient biblical tradition the idea of self-control that we find
in the Sabbath. That time at the end of the first creation, when God created the heavens
of the earth, and for six days he did all sorts of things, and on the seventh day it says
he rested. What he created on that day was rest, and it was intentional, and it was given
to us. And through the time the tradition parlayed that, and it took the seven day rest,
And it said, okay, in seven years, we need to create a sabbatical.
And in a sabbatical year, all the land lay follow.
All the things were put aside.
You didn't plant anything.
You could harvest whatever came up as volunteer, but you put no stress on the land.
Our universities picked up that idea.
And they started using sabbatical as a way for their professors to take a time to study
and to rest and travel and write and refresh themselves before returning to the classroom
and teaching our students.
That was so vital to the journey
that tradition instituted another special time
at the end of seven, seven-year cycles,
at the 50th year.
And it was called the Year of Jubilee.
It was a special time.
Isaiah 61 verses 1 and 2 contains this.
The Spirit of the Sovereign, Lord, is own me
because the Lord has anointed me
to proclaim good news to the poor.
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
to proclaim freedom for the captives
and release from darkness for the prisoners.
To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
That's the Jubilee year, the year of the Lord's favor.
Now why am I sharing this?
Because as we emerge from some of the difficulties
we faced over the last couple of years,
we need the release of a year of Jubilee.
During Jubilee year, God commissions us to take full advantage of the life that we've
been given and restore it to the full.
The Jubilee year is a time for reflection on our purpose, and it's time to take strong
action toward accomplishing it.
It's a time when we're thankful for the grace of God and a determination to allow that grace
to be poured upon all who are in our sphere of influence.
Now deep in your hearts, deep in your hearts, would you not like to see everything renewed
and restored, everything go back to some sense of normalcy?
You long for that.
I do.
We can't undo what has been done and what we've been through, but we can move forward with
that renewed spirit and with that renewed attitude and help make things better than they
have ever been before. That is where Jubilee comes into the picture. We need the
year of the Lord's favor, whatever that means in terms of leadership and
progress as leaders. So what is a Jubilee year? Jubilee is when broken
relationships are mended. Jubilee year is when broken promises are forgiven.
Jubilee year is when bruised feelings are healed. Jubilee year is when the
distance from God is narrowed. Jubilee year is when the unfaithful renew their
promise to faithfulness. The Jubilee year is when dead dreams come back to
life. Jubilee is when hope is restored. Jubilee is when God becomes central in
our lives again. Jubilee is when everything new does not hold, everything
becomes new. We don't hold on to the past and hold the past against it. Jubilee insists
on visiting everything with fresh eyes, a renewed heart, a determined spirit, a newfound
commitment to the task that we've been called or in your case elected to do. I believe
in Jubilee. I've called our people at First Baptist Columbus into a year of Jubilee
And it has been absolutely wonderful.
I believe we need a Jubilee year for our great state, as we restore, renew, and refresh
our hearts and our minds, our souls and our relationships, our commitments and our leadership.
I become excited when I think about the limitless blessings, the limitless possibilities that
are there.
This takes self-control, it takes discipline, but the dividends are worth it.
you believe will transform our spirits and bless our great state of Georgia in an unbelievable way.
It will bring prosperity that we seek and enjoy a spirit of joy that will come into our lives.
It will bring unity. It will bring peace. You are key to what's happening here. You have to be
willing, no more than that, won't it more than anything else for Jubilee to
happen in your hearts and in this state? And if you do, you will look at
everyone and everything with fresh eyes. In the ancient Jubilee, the land was
returned to the people, the debts were forgiven, everything became new. The great
preacher Leslie Weatherhead was going on a trip and he went back to England to
Alders Gate where Methodism began and he went into the little chapel there
where Wesley was as he wrote strangely warned his heart was strangely
warned in that place. Weatherhead said I just wanted to sit there and just soak up
the atmosphere and while he was sitting there somebody came in a man didn't see
weatherhead walked all the way to the front, walked up to the pew that was the John Wesley
pew, so a plaque on it, and on that plaque it said, on this spot, May 24, 1738, John Wesley's
heart was strangely warmed. Immediately this older man dropped to his knees and he cried out,
do it again, Lord, do it again for me. May that be the prayer that we pray. Do it again, Lord,
do it again for each of us, may we draw close to the Lord and allow him to warm our hearts
and lead us as we lead other people. You are so important to what happens. You are vital to
what happens in this state now and laying the foundation for the future. It all deals with the
renewal of your heart and my heart as we look to the future and we can bring
things back to where they need to be. When you do it, there will be unity, there
will be prosperity for our great state of Georgia. You know, I'm going to close
with a prayer. And as we pray, I'm going to answer the child's question
of the oldest prayer in the Bible,
the one that has been prayed the longest.
In fact, I will offer it for you now.
The Lord bless you and keep you.
The Lord make his face to shine upon you
and be gracious to you.
The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
I add, may the Lord give you a year of Jubilee
and the legacy of joy and success in his precious name, Amen.
Will you join me for the pledge?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands.
When the nation under God is invisible,
with liberty and justice, crawl.
Mr. Speaker, thank you.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

He, like many of Georgia's Americans and folks in our world, contracted COVID.
He was sent home, recovering, but his body did not do well, and later he was admitted
to the hospital.
He's been fighting for a long time, and he lost that battle this past week, and today
is his funeral back in my community.
Rodney Castlebury is a fine human being, a solid Georgian, and a person that I called
friend.
And I want to do this really quickly, and I won't read the whole thing, but I want to
share with you as he lay and had to say goodbye to his family. He wrote this song and I'm
not going to sing it but I'm going to read you just the first little bit. I'm going to be
sharing this with my community and his story is going to continue and I appreciate local
news channel 46 came to our community to start telling this story but it's one that I think
can speak to us all. Even if the plans I made all seem to change and the road that
traveled feels so very strange, even if the world seems to always knock me down,
I'm reminded of Jesus, you're where my hope is found. Knowing you will hold my hand through this
old weary world, you'll be right there beside me through the darkness of the storm,
because heaven is awaiting and I know you will be there, so I'll trust you Lord with my whole heart,
even if I don't understand, if you'll pause to remember Rodney, my friend.
Thank you, Speaker.
