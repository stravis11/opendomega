TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you you you you you you you you you you you you have the podium. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is Senator Resuluce 371. It's going to create a Senate study committee on rural medical personnel recruitment. Right now, one of the challenges our rural health care facilities, rural hospitals are facing is recruiting surgeons and surgical personnel into their area. And a study is needed to raise awareness of the challenges that they face. And that would be the goal of this study that we would ask for favorable consideration. Okay, any questions for the author? All right, what's the will of the committee? Senator Diggand, you recognize it this time? Motion due pass, Mr. Chairman. I got a motion due pass from Senator Diggand. I got a second from my vice chairman. All in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed, like sign. Motion passes unanimous. Thank you. Congratulations. Good job, not procrastinating. All right, HB 454, Representative Sean Blackman with got a substitute that is in your folder. And we are working off of... LC432855S. And it is my understanding Senator Dullesall where you're going to go through the substitute. Senator Huffseller. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you doing it? If we want to go through the open, the substitute will. I'll tell you what, Representative Sean Blackman, come on up, please. If you'll tell us what's in the underlying bill, then we'll go through the... And then... One of y'all can go through it. Section 1 is an update to the IRC, and it would actually allow for manufacturers to expense their items in year 1, like they have been doing instead of spread out over five years. Section 2 through 5, or some help us kind of align with the conditions and changes to existing provisions of the income tax code. Section 6 is a provision that would change the definition of force, measure to accommodate a pandemic as a natural disaster. And then there are some other provisions I think that Chairman Huffseller can probably speak to. And I'm happy to dig as deep into the weeds as you like me and my points best I could. Well, this time is there any questions for the author? Okay. Which one of y'all wants it? Senator Dole's all. You're recognized. Number 1. There is a sub, and the only change of the sub is found in line 234 in Section 7. We have added the word without replacing in order to ensure that Choa was not captured in this language relative to their closure and replacing of a hospital. Choa meaning the children's health care. Health care is what I said. Not go or coup. Oh yeah. There is no more go or coup. Okay. Representative Blackman or U.K. would that change? Not that it matters, but are U.K. would that change? No. The intent was not to, I don't believe your intent was to do that and you're okay making it clear. Thank you. Thank you for working with the Senate on anything really. Thank you for working with us. I'm me sir. Appreciate that. Okay. What's the world of committee? We need base up to two. So we've got a, where's my agenda? I've got a motion do pass by substitute. LC. 432855 Sierra. I've got a motion from our majority whip. Second from our majority caucus chairman. Any further discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed, like sign. All right. Motion passes unanimous. Only the floor. And then back up here to rules. Okay. So that's where we're at. I'm going to put us in recess. Well that makes its way down to the floor to be, well, at five o'clock it'll be red. House members that are here, if you all would, for say good time, let's just go ahead and start going through the sheet. Okay, that's where's the yellow sheet? All right. Well, I'll just go off of this. Are we going through sheets or what are we doing? I thought I was going back to the floor. Yeah. I'm going to pass it to one. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. As Ryan is passing out the yellow sheet, there is, there are three bills that are supposed to be on the yellow sheet that did not make it. And so you'll make note of these is HB 237, HB 538, and HB 122. So, HB 530 is not there. Was it supposed to be? And HB 530. So you'll make little scrivener notes. All right. The add to yellow sheet, HB 237, HB 538, 122, and 530, 530 zero. And that's in no particular order. It's certainly not in numeric order. HBs, right? Yes. Okay. 530 or 237? Okay. There's one there. There's one there. Okay. They're on there now. I am putting them on there now. Okay. Okay. Well, then we're good. All right. Who's up first? Let's just go down the line. Or, Senator James, actually, let's go with you, Senator James, what you got? Thank you very much. The first page, SR250, is the city of East Point and the city of South Fulton to take joint action. It's just an urging resolution to take joint action to activate the East Point and South Fulton Hospital Authority to establish a new hospital in that area. Okay. Thank you. All right. Senator Williams, did you have anything? I'm not sure I just got the yellow feet, sir. Okay. All right. Representative Lovert, you want to come to the podium? I'm sorry. I mean, you may call it on me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize. I have not had a chance to look at the yellow sheet to see if the other bills I was discussing with the Chairman are on there. Just tell us what you got. I got House Bill 186, which is the judicial council bill that makes some changes to the code so that it will conform to changes that the General Assembly made last year by an actment of the state and spearcorded pellet practice. Yep. Page 34th from the bottom. Thank you very much. What else? I'm going to ask the House Bill 375, which basically adds a definition of gross settlement to the conservator statute to make it clear that the cutoff for having to go to court to get settlement, what that includes at that dollar figure. Page 6th halfway down. Okay. And there's 563, which is a department bill that the Equal Opportunity Commission has requested to change from a special master proceeding to Office of State Administrative hearings. Okay. You know, I've noticed you house, you're bringing a lot of department bills. That's my only one. I mean, it's like one of a thousand. But it's okay. Everything's either for the department or for the kids. That's right, Mr. Chairman. But those are two important things. Okay. Thank you. And I've already presented the other. So thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Yep. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to present House Bill 121. 121 addresses some concerns and issues we have on our Georgia lakes and reservoirs with the operation of wakeboats and boats that are generating rather large waves, causing damage and personal protection issues. The bill also includes a provision which will allow people who have what we'd normally call a side by side or a UTV type vehicle under the right circumstances to be able to purchase a license plate to go on there and operate on county roads only. Okay. Did you have anything else? No sir. All right, Representative Anderson. We appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Senator? Yes sir. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, page six, top number, HB317, this allows families to benefit areas to assign insurance benefits to funeral homes of state employees' retirement, life insurance. That made it through last year. I mean, I think it's a good idea to have a child. Oh, last day. So did it die on the house side or the Senate side? It died on the Senate side, sir. Oh, but you're here now. I had to come over here to try to get it on through. Yes sir. Is that the only reason you ran was to get to the Senate and get this bill out? No sir. Okay. One other one on page seven, House Bill 498. This bill was successfully passed last year through both the House and the Senate and the Attorney General's Office came back and said there was one word needed to be changed, so it would affect the people whose license had lapsed in the past, as well as the people's whose license well laps in the future. That they can get their license reinstated. Is this why you ran for the Senate? I need my license, sir. All right. Thank you. You guys, Senator? That's it right now. Thank you, sir. You've had a great session. Thank you for working with me, sir. I've enjoyed working with everyone over you now. Thank you very much. All right. You still my favorite, sir. Well, I appreciate that. Until after this committee ends. Come on up, representants. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm here to present two bills. First one is HB299. It adds the Space Force as one of the recognized branches of the Department of Defense. Happy to ask any questions on that one if anybody has any? Hearing none. Okay. And the other is HB374. I call it the Cut and Blow Act. So it gives you, first, it protects the fuel sources for any type of equipment such as specifically plant equipment. And then otherwise it all leaf floors. And then it also protects fuel sources for like stoves and people's houses to ensure that they have access to the fuel source of their choice. So it's consumer protections. It additionally adds an additional method for de-annexation. So that's it. Those are the three. Questions for the office? Yes, the door is not green. All right. Senator, okay. Thank you. Any questions? None. All right. Senator Parent, did you have anything? I was shocked. HB528 that is another consumer protection bill about being able to get yourself off and recurring subscriptions without, you know, many, many hours on the phone devoted to that that is representative Houston Gaines' bill. Thank you, committee. So that will be automatic? No, it's not an automatic. Okay. No, but if you, you know how you can get yourself on those things and then essentially it would allow you to get off and then in this, right, via the same method for which you got on as opposed to. I'd say $800 a month. Oh, you got to call and be on hold for 17 hours. Okay. Thank you. Senator Harbor, you got something. That was HB528 for the record. 20. Mr. Chairman, committee. Senator Harbor. H52 down. HB285 has to do with the retirement plans for Georgia's firefighters and teachers and it's basically to allow them to increase the percentage within alternative investments. Say that number again. HB285. HB285. 285 around the perimeters, sir. Page five, second. Page five, second one down. All right. Any questions? You doing all the heavy lifting for your house member over there? Yes, sir. Lift him, trying to help him. All right. They need all the help they can get. They do. All right. Thank you, Representative Gamble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hadn't seen a yellow sheet, but I think I'm on their house bill 285. I don't know if you're on the house bill 280. You are on the top of page five. Thank you, sir. This bill adds to what we did last year in a bill that we passed. It gives the property and casualty insured the opportunity to offer a law mitigation device in the sale of those policies. That could be a water leak sensor or smoke detector. All this does is add a life insurance agent to the bill so that they can offer a blood pressure bit in the sale of a life insurance policy. So that's the bill. Okay. Is that all you got? That's it. Thank you. You're efficient. Thank you. My old counterpart banking chairman. I tell you what, Mr. Chairman, it's like the same having the new banking chairman. Well, we saw what happened to the banking industry after I left, you know. Well, well, you also noticed in Georgia everything is still good, so. That's true. I've got, I had a global effect. Well, some would say you do. I've got House Bill 63. I don't know if it's on the yellow sheet or not. It just came out of committee yesterday. It's a simple bill on health insurance for fully insured groups, 20 and above. It just requires the insurance carriers to provide claims experience to the groups 60 days out before renewal. Some page two, third down from the top. Any questions? Thank you. Thank you, sir. Senator Setsler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, page three, fourth from the bottom, HB204. Build us two things. First, it creates a good local government bill. Creates a council of municipal court clerks. So that organization can further train and professionalize their profession. And also clarifies that only the General Assembly can draw county commission districts for commission district lines every 10 years. Glad to take questions. I don't see any. You did such a great job. Thank you. All right. Jack. I'm back, Chairman Brass, members of the rules committee. I'm here to request House Bill 543, which passed out a Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Couser, does the Senate sponsor? This is a six person jury trial bill. Everything in the current statute stays the same except increasing the dollar amount from $25,000 to $50,000 under the Senate Judiciary Committee version. And I wanted to follow up on two bills presented previously. House Bill 182, which is a state bar of Georgia bill to correct a acknowledged deeds, court decision, and protects security interest. And House Bill 444, which keeps clear title following Liz Pendens. That was a Senate bill passed last year. We're following back up to get it in the law. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm not sure if this is on the yellow sheet yet or not, but it's House Bill 31. It's to dedicate the hazardous waste trust fund fees to the hazardous waste. Trust fund to clean up hazardous waste sites. Page one, second from the bottom. Thank you. Good job. Representative Taylor, you ready? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Today, I bring you House Bill 315. And this is an update from last year's bill on breast cancer. It requires insurance companies to allow the second follow-up when there's a density issue. And it will make them pay it the same way. What it actually does is make the date of the criteria that the decision is made on up to the insurance commissioner. Last year, it was put in a date, 2022, and there were updates every year. We don't want to tie it to just one year. And I also have a nice bill of 317, which is for the retirees life insurance, so that the beneficiary may direct that money to the funeral homes. 317. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Representative LaHood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm not sure if House Bill 455 is on the yellow sheet. It is on the middle of the page 7. All right, great. Well, House Bill 455 would establish a program to address issues related to career fatigue and wellness within among health care professionals. I think most everybody here is well aware that there's a workforce crisis going on. Well, really in all sectors, but a lot of different sectors, but in health care for sure. And so this program would help to address key people in the game, key people in the workforce, rather than then burnout and leave fatigue and burn out and defeated. So this gives them a safe place to do that without fear of being jeopardy of losing their license or being discoverable. This bill has broad support. Did in the House and it passed the Senate Committee with a new opposition. Any questions for the author? Thank you. All right. Thank you. And also thank you for your consideration of 497 that I've already presented in here. Appreciate it. Okay. Appreciate that. Okay. What do you all want to do now? Okay. Standard ease. Standard ease. Standard ease. Standard ease. Standard ease. Standard ease. Okay. Yo, there is one more bill, at least one more bill, that is being made available that got out of committee late. And it was just oversight not making it on the yellow sheet. HB 196. Senator Cowsard, you want to cover that real quick.

I'll be glad to thank Mr. Chairman. That came out of committee today is what probably you got second rid of a while ago. It's a medical marijuana bill to try to streamline clean up the commission's procedures so we'll have less controversy on licenses and to set forth additional licenses, possibilities in the future. I have 30. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Yes. The number three. Your hostellary recognized. I'm going to speak on House Bill 504 because that is a Senate substitute. The original author over there. When he saw the fiscal note he had said he didn't think it was going to be very much money. It was about $300 million. He said don't hear my bill. So we put on the hospital tax credit on this bill. Is it no increase and just a short sunset to December 31st, 2026. And then one other I would like to consider and it might have been late getting out. But that was House Bill 295. This is the cleanup. We did surprise buildings several years ago. We worked off season with insurance department, the providers of insurance and the health care providers. And it came to a pretty good consensus on everything. The insurance commissioners office was having some problems implementing some things. Whenever having a new bill they needed to extend some deadlines and stuff to make their job easier over there. And so this was a bill worked out with everybody on board. And I don't think there's any opposition to that. And it will help the insurance commissioner do his job a lot better. I think that we learned from that. That was House Bill 295. Okay. Did figure out one little issue. We were the original plan was to when we come back at five or after five. This was just a draft. And so there's a few bills that are going on here that didn't make it on the draft because they were laid out of committee. And so for some of y'all out there, there's still hope. And for some of y'all there's not. But I will emphasize it did have to make it out of committee today to get in here. So to be eligible. We are waiting on the final list to come back. But there are a few other bills as I had mentioned earlier that we're not on here that we'll be on here later. 196 being one of those. But that was that was the issue. That's that's my fault. Would you want to get in a little bit. But I was for I didn't think you wanted to sit here and twit all your thomes. I thought we'd start hearing some bills. Representative Senator Williams. Yes, I have. You're back. Yes sir. Thank you. I was asking for Senate resolution 383. Some of our friends in East Palestine, Ohio, who have undergone a massive trained derailment that suggested we do some studying on railway setting. Railway safety and train safety and maintenance and upkeep of trains that are coming through Georgia with these dangerous chemicals and things. So who out of Ohio wants us to look in Georgia? They're concerned because they have gone through a lot of things here lately with the trains. And they just don't want anybody else to have to go through what they've gone through. I've got a few things I'd like Ohio to do. Yes sir. Are they doing any legislation for us? No and this doesn't affect Ohio. This will affect Georgia only sir. They're they're being neighborly. All right. Well that might make it on the next sheet. It might not. We'll see. Okay. Thank you sir. Thank you. Representative you want to. I'm just here watching the bus season. Are you intrigued? How am I doing? He does a good prior where you like him to put me. I need some prior. All right. Well let's stay in a decent for a little bit or by catch your breath. I want y'all to have all the documentation you need to make educated decisions for the great citizens of the great state of Georgia. Yes. So at five o'clock the lieutenant governor said we're going to go back on. But just so you know we're going back on so that they can first read what we just report out of committee what we just sent out of standing. And so those will be back here and be available on the final yellow sheet. So as soon as they do that. And then we'll send it's going to recess again and then we'll we'll unresist. And we'll be back in here and then we're going to make picks and so just so y'all know too we're going to everybody's going to get three picks. Three picks. There's 18 members on this. Own here. And so three picks. So that's 54 bills plus maybe a few more that will be on the floor for Monday. Plus if there's anything that was tabled today that does not get off the table today. Those will be their Monday as well. So if you remember on crossover I think we did 66 bills went to the floor and so this will be right on par with that. All right so standard ease but again house members just remember these guys and girls are going to be in ladies. And ladies are going to be making the picks so lady. I'm sorry lady. We'll be making the picks so you got a little time to do some last minute lobbying. Representative Crowe did you want to address the committee before we officially recess? No thank you Mr. Chairman. I came to present House Bill 504 but I think as I came in chairman Hustetler was talking about that one. That was one that had been subbed in the Senate Finance Committee with the rural hospital tax credits and the Georgia peach program tax credits. So I think he had already done that as I was walking in so he did and he did a fine job. I have no doubts sir thank you. Thank you for being here. All right y'all relax. We're in recess. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you

All right, with that, who's a good pray in mind? How goodness. Doc, yeah, you best we got. You mind leading us in prayer? Yes sir. Wow, it's...

We thank you for this opportunity through Christ our Lord, Amen and Amen y'all. Thank you. Okay, we've heard presentations. You've got your sheet. Drum roll please. I was joking. All right. All right, before I'm going to do this something real quick. Senator Albers was very gracious yesterday in allowing us to hold rules at two o'clock and I booted him in his committee out of here and they moved all the way to 9 a.m. So I did tell him I would give him an extra...
