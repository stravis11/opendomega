I want to thank the majority leader, Chairman Marcus Wiedauer, Chairman Prince for leading that effort.
As well as House-regulated Industries Chairman Powell for working on this issue of professional licensing for many years.
What this bill does is it provides better constituent services.
It brings professional licensing into the 21st century.
It gives what the people of Georgia and our small businesses deserve, which is a better
professional licensing system so that hardworking Georgians and small businesses can get to work
and not have to fool around with burdensome regulations during licensing.
It also gives the professional licensing division the authority to grant licenses that are
in order and it frees up our boards to focus on bad actors.

Representative Seabaw has recognized to present the bill House Bill 549.
Thank you, speakers and members of the House.
I rise today to present House Bill 549.
Under current Georgia law law enforcement agency may seek reimbursement for
mandated training expenses when a peace officer is trained by one agency and
a way by another within 15 months of completing that training.
Last year the required mandating training was increased by 50% from 400 hours to 800 hours.
And all House Bill 459 does is extend the reimbursement window from 15 months to 36 months.
Ensuring agencies have a fair opportunity to recover their investment in their officer's training.
That is the bill and I'll stand for any questions.
Mr. Speaker.
And gentlemen, I have no questions.
Thank you. I yield the well.

have all members voted
All members now voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you log the machine on the passage of House
Bill 549, the yeas are 164, 164, the Mays are zero, this bill having seated records
the constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the
caption of House Bill 150, 150? House of 150,
I represent a plumbing of 114 to be titled and act to amend Part 2, Article 2, Chapter 3,
titled 20 of the Fitch go to Georgia and Tate relating the university system.
So it's required quarterly reports regarding certain funding received from
individuals or entities related to China, this bill ever referred to the
Committee on Higher Education.
That committee recommends a dispelled do-pass by committee substitute.
Representative Fleming is recognized to present the bill.
Representative Tim Fleming.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I bring you to today House Bill 150.
It is the combating threats from foreign countries of concern act for 2025 regarding higher
education.
Foreign countries of concern means the country whose government is designated as a foreign
adversary by the United States Secretary of Commerce.
What House Bill 150 does is promotes transparency in foreign funding to our higher ed institutions
in Georgia for the university system to report quarterly to the General Assembly and to
the Governor of any funding received from these foreign countries of concern, other than
simple tuition payments for an individual.
It requires a university system to track and report the type of funding, its source,
And it's a mount, it's purpose, and it documents its basis.
Mr. Speaker, that is House Bill 150, and if there are no questions, I'd yield the well.
You have a question to your layoff representative.
We're mine, I just recommend I ask for a question.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Is it gentlemen yield?
Yes, ma'am.
Why do we always limit these bills to a specific list?
Because sometimes there are some unique circumstances we have to be on lookout for in the state of Georgia.
So wouldn't it make more sense for the sake of transparency to get a full report on all the
possible foreign funding that our universities are getting?
So this is a, represent, this is a moving list.
So it changes, it could change month, month, week to week
with countries coming on and coming off.
And that's why we're used that language
because it's actually a list that the Secretary of Commerce,
Department of Commerce puts out in updates pretty regularly.
Does the gentleman for their year?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I'm aware of how this list works.
And my issue with it is that one, like you mentioned,
it does move around a lot, which creates uncertainty
for creating these types of reports.
And my concern is that when we are so narrowly focused
on just one thing, we do risk missing
other potential threats.
So that's where my questions come from.
Thank you.
Gentlemen has one more question.
Representing Jasmine Clark to your left.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does a gentleman yield?
Yes, ma'am.
Briefly, you know, we had a chat about this in committee.
And while I understand the premise of this bill,
My biggest concern is that it labels any individual who lives in one of these foreign countries
as a person or an individual of concern, and I just have some heartburn about dislabeling
anyone who lives in one of these places as a concerning individual.
Yes, man.
We had that discussion in committee through the hearing, and it does say in the bill
they have to be domiciled in those countries, but this is not pertaining to tuition.
So anybody who's playing tuition is not pertain to,
it's just for all other funds
that are people who are domicating those countries.
But yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
The gentleman's yielded the well.
Is any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here he none, the previous question is ordered.
Is any objection to adopting the committee's subsidy?
Here he none, the committee's subsidy is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee
which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
Chair, here's none.
And the board of committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All in favor of the passage of the bill?
We'll vote yes.
All those opposed, we'll vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
All members voted.
All members voted.
So, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?
On the passage of House Bill 150, the A's are 145, the A's are 22.
This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore, therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 288?
288.
House Bill 288 by Representative Gaines, the 120th and others to be titled next to a men
article 2, chapter 6, title 5, chapter 4, chapter 9, article 1, chapter 18, and title 15,
and chapter 16, and of title 17, the official go to George annotated relating to fellow
practice, declaratory judgements, prosecuting attorneys, and criminal trials.
This bill have inferred the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security.
That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute.
We're representing Houston Gaines as recognized to present House Bill 288.
Thank you, thank you, Ms. Speaker.
House Bill 288, I believe, is a common sense bill that will provide due process for law
enforcement officers when accused by a prosecutor of not being credible or what's so being put
on what's so called a giglio or Brady list. Currently, a prosecutor can single-handedly
ruin a police officer's career by putting a cop on such a list with no due process. When
put on a Brady giglio list, getting a new job for an officer becomes almost impossible
because their credibility has been questioned. It's important that an officer does have
a real credibility issue that can be resolved and investigated. Currently, the officer
is just placed on such a list and there is no investigation.
House Bill 288 will provide necessary due process for officers by ensuring a review of
posts upon an accusation by a prosecutor which will provide the factual basis for putting
an officer on such a list.
It also ensures an officer cannot be disciplined solely for being put on the list until an investigation
has been resolved and the officer has been founded and acted improperly.
The bill requires posts to be notified
in the officer's employing agency,
which would then be required to notify the officer.
Currently, some officers don't even know
if they're put on such a list.
They also ensure the investigation occurs,
so if the officer does have a credibility issue,
that can be resolved,
and if there's an officer's done something wrong,
they would no longer be employed.
I will note that in its initial form,
the prosecutors in the state had some concerns,
we worked very closely with PAC to address
those concerns, I believe we've crafted a piece of legislation that resolves those
issues. And so I also want to say thank you to represent Matt Reeves and Chairman Clint
Crowe, Chairman Tyler Paul Smith who worked with us on this. Several states have recently
addressed this issue. North Carolina, Iowa and Minnesota are just a couple of examples.
And I'm going to speak, I'm happy to answer a question or two if there are any.
Gentlemen, have some questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the will?
Gentlemen, as you are the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Hearing none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Hearing none, the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the past of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the past of the bill?
We'll vote yes, all those opposed, we'll vote no.
Okay, Miss Clerk, will you lock the machine?
I have all members voted, all members voted, if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the
on the passage of House Bill 288.
The A's are 146.
The A's are 20.
This bill here is either requisite constitutional majority,
is therefore passed.
Members, I'm going to take a speaker's moment here.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and my esteemed colleagues.
Happy cross over day.
Today I rise for your favorable consideration of HB 583.
This bill is just a simple upgrade of recognition and relief
to the veterans in our state.
It is our honor always to show gratitude to all our veterans.
Today, we know that they dedicated themselves
in years past, serving and protecting this nation,
often facing significant challenges, sacrifices
during their military careers.
In recognition of those who became disabled while serving,
this bill will allow them to have a second free license plate,
which they can use for their spouse, another vehicle,
or a motorcycle, caveat here.
My husband is a disabled vet,
and I'm in line behind the motorcycle
if this passes to get a tag on my car.
40 years, I'm still a second.
This bill is supported by service men, women,
retired veterans, disabled veterans,
VSOs, VFWs, and other veteran organizations.
I ask your favorable consideration of this second tag
for our veterans.
If it's being called, I yield for questions.
You have a question, I saw this one coming,
but I wasn't sure if it's gonna happen or to you left.
Kind of thought she might have a question on this
from the ladies recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, because the lady you.
Yes.
Would it not be my honor in my county
to be able to advise the constituents
that come in and ask, why can I only get one plate
when we have two vehicles?
This will allow that family the same security
and they can additionally still receive their handicap
cracker.

Today I bring you House Bill 44, which is for the Georgia law books, which are the tan books in your office rather than the black code books.
What this bill does is allow the books to be published in either hard copy form or digital form
and maintaining a digital option can improve accessibility to everyone.

The council probate judges has requested it and it just requires that they be ready by January 1 of 2028.

Representative Panich, you pulled a fast one on the speaker and he won't forget it either.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 647?
647?
House Bill 647 by Representative Donald Tucci, the 105th to be entitled an act to amend an act to incorporate the City of Mulberry.
This bill haven't been referred to the Committee on Intergovernmental Coordination.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Mr. Speaker, members, thank you for hearing this bill today.
This bill is about annexing 45 small parcels into Mulberry.
All of these parcels are in my district.
My background is in land use.
I served as a county planning commissioner.
When I was running for office,
one of the most frequent complaints raised by voters to me
besides inflation, was the issue of growth in Wunette County.
Specifically, high density apartments
and the rapid pace of growth and overburdening
local infrastructure.
The city of Mulberry was born out of this frustration
and the request of the people giving citizens
within the city local control over planning and zoning.
Now that I've been elected,
I can do something to help give my constituents
more control over growth in our community.
This annexation bill simply allows the city of Mulberry
to expand into my district, adding roughly 45 parcels
to the city limits.
These parcels are a mix of residential dwellings,
commercial properties and undeveloped land,
primarily located along one road
on the north end of my district.
Moving these parcels into the city of Mulberry
will allow my constituents to have a greater local voice
over how this land is developed and used in the future,
allowing decisions to be made by five locally elected
city councilmen rather than the majority,
than a majority of county commissioners
to do not live in the community.
Mr. Speaker, I yield for any questions.
You have one question to your right
right up the center aisle representative Gamble.
Let's recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the general lady yield?
I do.
Just for clarification, the city of Mulberry
doesn't have anything to do with the Palmetto Berry.
Does it?
It does not.
All right, thank you.
I think this is the first time I've seen the lady in the well, I believe, isn't it?
No.
No.
That's not the first time I've seen it.
Just checking.
Herpes even washburn to your left is recognized for a question.
Way to your left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yes.
Will the general lady yield for a question?
I do.
Is this your first time in the well to present a bill?
It is my first time to present a bill. Yes. Okay. Is it will you give for another question? I do.
Are there any Mulberry bushes in the city of Mulberry?
There used to be.
Thank you.
We're going to take a couple more lady, couple of questions for the lady from Mulberry.
And then we have a couple of folks that want to speak to the bill.
What, no, let's see.
Chairman Stevens has recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, way over to your left.
Is I recall Barney Fife is from Mayberry?
Is that not true?
Does he live in your town?
He used to.
Does he have a lady, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, he was all through the bill last year,
but lady, you for another question?
for one more, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Martin to your right.
Form a mayor of a small city.
This is going to be a big city.
It's recognized for a question.
The lady, you know, I do.
Is it true?
I appreciate the questions.
And I'm kidding you a little bit about the name of the city.
But this is a serious question.
Isn't it true what the ladies try to do
is bring government closer to the people.
And you can do this without an increase in their taxes.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, are you yield the well?
Lady proceeds like a veteran, because you are the well.
Good move.
So we do have a couple of folks to speak in opposition.
I'm going to give them seven minutes each to speak to the bill.
Up to seven minutes, you don't have to take that long.
President Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill, HB 647.
Give the lady your attention, please.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
Today I rise in opposition to House Bill 647.
As the chair of the Gwinnett delegation, my concerns about this bill
are based on procedure and precedence.
Let's be clear, House Bill 647 is a hyper local bill
that annexes certain county properties
into the city of Mulberry.
If you remember, the city of Mulberry was created
when the city hood process that normally takes
about two years was expedited through this chamber
and took only 20 days in the last legislative session
to the objection of the majority of the Gwyneth delegation.
During debate, we stated that when you rush the process,
it will lead to issues, and alas, here we are.
Less than a year later, and we are seeing bills
that try to annex additional properties.
And hey, I get it, annexations happen.
But in Gwinnett County, we have a very specific delegation
process in order to maintain the integrity
of the local legislative process.
And we have successfully used that local process
for other annexations, including this year,
where we are doing some annexation in the city of Lawrenceville.
Our process is quite simple.
The city and the county go to the table and negotiate
about the properties to be annexed
when negotiations are complete.
The city and the county notify the members
of the delegation legislation is drafted
by legislative council and then in a bipartisan manner,
a majority of our delegation members sign the bill.
It then goes through the local legislation process
of the Intergovernmental Coordination Committee.
This process works, it has works,
and it recognizes that while bills must come through
the legislature, we respect our local governments
and will not force things down their throat.
Moving this very local bill as a general bill
through this body and an effort to skirt the rules
that both Republicans and Democrats signed on to.
And let me be clear, I have placed article three
of our delegation rules on everyone's desk
for you all to see in section three,
we specify how annexations are supposed to be done
in Gwinnett County.
We had a majority of our delegation,
including the sponsor of this bill, sign on to these rules.
So a vote for yes on this bill is a vote against local control and local government.
It basically states that you are okay with the state going behind your back, snatching
up properties from your county without allowing you to even come to the table.
I sincerely believe that most of us do not want that happening in our counties.
Let's protect the integrity of the local delegation process, vote no on this bill, so
that we can actually do this process the proper way.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
The ladies, yield to the will, will part, represent Sam Park is recognized to speak to the bill, represent the park.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I rise in opposition to House Bill 647.
You know, I think it's important, especially in the political environment,
to remember the importance of the rule of law.
We are a nation, what's made us great as a nation is respecting the rule of law.
And yet this bill demonstrates that might makes right,
which is unfortunate.
Now, I rise today to speak against House Bill 647
for the following reasons.
As public servants, our duty is to uphold
the interests of our constituents
and ensure government serves them,
not the other way around.
This bill, which seeks to expand the corporate limits
of the city of Mulberry,
and there's two or three additional
Mulberry-related bills because the process was not followed,
The rules of government affairs committee was not followed with respect to creating the
city of Mulberry.
Through annexation, this raises serious concerns about property rights, taxation, and government
overreach.
First and foremost, we must protect private property rights.
This is one of the foundations of our democracy, which is the right to own and control property,
And this bill proposes to Annex numerous parcels of land and we must ask, have all affected
property owners been consulted?
Has there been a local ad notice provided for this legislation?
Are we respecting their right to choose how their land is governed and whether or not
they want to be forcibly annexed into this new city?
That's resulted in litigation and unnecessary fights that's divided and exacerbated
partisan flames unnecessarily.
This bill represents an unnecessary expansion
of government power.
We should be focused on reducing bureaucracy, not expanding it,
not forcing an additional layer of government
on people without their consent.
We cannot ignore the financial consequences
of this annexation.
With expanded city limits come increased taxes, municipal fees,
other hitting costs that will be passed on homeowners and small businesses, again without
their consent.
Many of our constituents are already struggling to keep up with the rising costs of living.
Why add to their burden?
Our job is to fight for lowering costs and for responsible spending, not imposing unknown
and uncertain financial hardships on working families.
Now zoning and land use regulations are another major concern.
When a city annexes property, it imposes new zoning restrictions and land use rules.
What was once under Winnett County's governance will now be subject to different regulations,
potentially limiting how property owners can use their land.
Again, these property owners having no opportunity to voice whether or not they want to be included or excluded in this city.
This is a state government forcing upon the people of Georgia a decision which they have
no notice or opportunity to decide upon.
This bill also weakens county governance and local control.
When that county has managed these areas effectively and there is no clear reason why city oversight
would be an improvement.
When that county is one of the few counties, the second largest in the state of Georgia that
has a AAA bond rating.
Here's the written documentation and again an opportunity for voters to determine their
own future with their homes, with their own property.
So where does it end?
If we approve this annexation, we open the door for another and additional forced annexations,
forced city expansions without the consent of the governed, more state government overreach
and disruption for affected communities.
Now, I'm a member of the minority party,
and hopefully that won't be the case all the time.
But I want to ask members of the majority,
what would you do if you were in the minority
and the state government forcibly annex parts
of your district that you represent?
That's what this is about.
We must consider the long-term consequences
of setting this precedent.
Finally, and I think most importantly,
we demand transparency and voter input.
The residents of these areas will not have an opportunity
to vote on this change.
Does this legislation have a referendum?
No.
Then this process fundamentally lacks democratic legitimacy.
We should not be making decisions that fundamentally alter the governance of a community without ensuring that the people have had their voices heard.
And so again, colleagues, House Bill 647 is not just about adjusting city limits. It is about standing up for property rights.
It is about standing up for fiscal responsibility and the principles of limited government.
It's ensuring that we are a nation of rules and we demonstrate that as leaders with our
actions, rather than perpetuating the falsity that might make right, the falsity that
if you and the majority, you can do whatever you want because you have the votes.
So for all these reasons, I urge all members in this body to vote no to House Bill 647.
Let's stand together in defense of common sense American principles and responsible governance.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Thank you, Mr. Will.
The gentleman is yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here he none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Here in the other board, the committee has agreed to show this bill now passed all in favor of the pasture of the bill.
We'll vote yes, all those opposed.
We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?
One of the passes of House Bill 647, the A's, or 98, and the A's, or 76, is Bill having to see the records of constitutional majority as their four past.
All right, here's our posture of members.
This House is going to stand in recess until 3.30 p.m. today.
Thank y'all can.
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to recognize you.
You think you can get your work done by 315?
