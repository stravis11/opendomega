TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Darcy Robb. I'm the Executive Director
of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities. You won't be hearing much from me today. You're
going to be hearing from a young man who describes himself as a Jeanette survivor. You're going
to be hearing from a mother whose child is currently stuck in the Jeanette system. And
We're going to be hearing from a young man who had the opposite experience, whose inclusive
post-secondary education laid the foundation for a good life today.
We're all here today talking about education.
The some ways our state needs to keep doing well, and other ways in which our state is
failing our children, especially children with disabilities.
We need to value education for all of Georgia's children and youth.
We need to fund what our students need to succeed, and we need an education to be inclusive
not segregated.
Inclusive education means using different educational tools so we can educate students
with disabilities alongside their peers.
When inclusive education is done right, there is a lot of research and there is a lot of
real-world experience that shows inclusive education is best for all students, not just
students with disabilities.
On Georgia's roadmap to inclusion, which is a document my team and I have produced and
we will share with you, you can see there are a number of steps to this.
Some of them can and should be done now, such as making sure retired teachers can come
back into the classroom, ending the Gnet system, and making inclusive post-secondary education
grants permanent.
And there's something we need to start now.
We need to overhaul the QBE.
The Quality Basic Education Act that directs how Georgia's public school systems are funded
was created in 1985.
It has not had a major update since.
More than 40 years old and it does not reflect the needs of today's world or today's students.
I'm going to hand it over to our host today.
He's a legislator who is championed in Georgia with disabilities and that is Senator Billy
Thank you all for being here. It's such a great crowd. I'm Senator Billy Hickman from
States of Georgia. I represent Senator District 4 and of course one of my favorite people
Oh, here's the day you're not smart, huh?

Everyone here who is behind me,
to head to rights that day to serve.
Thank you.
All right.
You know, some people may think Martha's shy,
but she's not.
Thank you, Martha.
Well, thank you all for being here today.
K-12 education is one of the most influential peers
in a young person's life.
especially for students with disabilities.
The experiences, support, and expectation
set during these years shaped long-term outcomes
in employment, independence, and community inclusion.
Senate Bill 150, which is my bill,
is an important step in the right direction
by strengthening the teaching workforce
and bringing high quality, impactful educators
back into the workforce and classroom Senate Bill 150
helps ensure that students across Georgia,
all of students across Georgia,
including students with disabilities,
have access to a strong and consistent education.
This bill is not the final step
in making our education system fully accessible
and inclusive, but it is a meaningful
and necessary starting point.
I am so proud to stand with the disability community
in supporting Senate Bill 150
and to continue to work to ensure every student in Georgia
has the opportunity to succeed.
Thank you.
Woo!
Woo!
All right, we all knew legislators move quickly
in and around these parts.
I don't know if Senator Dixon is here or representative Lim.
I know they had both mentioned wanting to speak.
I got somebody, hey, come on up.
Representative Lim.
Thank you all so much for having me.
And thank you to Chairman Hickman,
Senator Hickman for the work that he's been doing.
I don't think any of us like when people make assumptions
about us, even if it's well-intended,
and especially if they're wrong.
And a lot of well-intended assumptions have been made
about education for people in the community
of people who are disabled for many, many years.
But we know, you all know, and if you don't know,
I'm telling you that the research,
the actual lived experiences shows
that inclusive education, integrating people
with disabilities in our classrooms,
raises everyone's level.
Those who are disabled and those who are not.
And that's why I'm so grateful that we are making this push.
I know Senator Dixon, we introduced a joint resolutions
to study this issue in both the House and the Senate last year.
And I know we've been pushing it.
We're both part of the Gwinnett delegation.
We sat down with our interim superintendent last summer,
along with a great advocate, Chelsea Hutchings,
to really push this in Gwinnett.
But we know that we need this throughout the state.
It's time to stop making those assumptions.
there are so many paths forward
and I hope that you will join us
because again, I will repeat,
inclusive education for people with disabilities
improves all education for all of our students
K through 12 and beyond.
So I'm so grateful to be here today
and thank you to you all for what you are doing.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
All right, we have, I don't think
Somebody stop me if I'm going off script here.
But we have a young man who calls himself
a survivor of genets.
So think about that for a minute,
a survivor of public education, segregated education.
I want to invite Daniel to come to the microphone now
and share his experiences with us.
How are you doing everybody?
My name is Chris Fix and I run Reflection Life Coaching and I'm fortunate to have one
of my clients here.
This is Daniel and he had a pretty harrowing experience through G-Nets and he wrote this
letter a long time ago when I first met him and I was approached to if I had any clients
who experienced Jeanette and I said I did and I'm really proud of him just for being
here.
A lot of anxiety for him so he wrote this so I'm going to read this on your behalf.
My name is Daniel Firebird and I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome from a very young age.
As such I was placed in special education for all my school life.
I was unfortunately admitted into the Jeanette system through false pretenses and I'm very
lucky to have survived. My story started not in Genets but at Johns Creek High School,
where I was physically and emotionally abused by the heads of the special needs department.
After they performed many illegal acts, bribes, death threats, and false reports,
I was admitted into Genets, specifically into North Metro program.
Described to many as the only other option besides jail, the environment was horrible,
all the students were struggling, some having been to prison at least once already,
Half of each assigned school location is designated to contain the low-functioning autistic students.
Yet, the teachers were ill-equipped to deal with some of them.
As they often came over to our side, screaming and coherently and destroying the place,
because that's how their brains worked.
Resource officers were often called in to restrain and inject medicine,
and the rest of us weren't allowed to defend ourselves,
because that was considered destructive behavior.
The program advertises the level system.
to interest parents proposing it is a means of transitioning to normal school through continued
good behavior. What they don't realize is that it's an inescapable trap designed to keep students
there forever. Whenever a student maintains perfect behavior and follows the programs rules perfectly,
they would always be unable to reach the final level due to unacceptable behavior.
And they weren't allowed to know what they did wrong. I eventually reported my encounters at
at Johns Creek High School at my experience with North Metro and IEP meeting and the head
of the entirety of Fulton Schools was there. School faculties, everything. He promised he
would launch a full-scale investigation only to illegally falsify one. Weeks later, contacted
my parents telling them I was just trying to get out of work. I was not contacted as part
of the procedure and a trip to JCHS years later revealed they never even set foot inside
the school. No where's there any communication to them from an investigators. My parents
finally caught on to this scheme. However, the application of the G-Nets takes away parents
legal rights to withdraw students from the program. So I've had to be taken out of school
entirely. I've yet to earn my high school diploma as a result. To the entire state of Georgia,
do better. Don't destroy lives. Troubled students are not a problem to contain. They're a
treasure that's been buried. And today we're here to unearth the grave digger.
Genets, shut it down and start fresh with people that actually care because
simply saying you care has lost all meaning.
And I don't want to point out Daniel right now is living in a three-bedroom condo
and he has a job and he has friends for the first time in his life. So I'm so
proud of this guy.
Hello, my name is Amanda Morris, and I'm the mother of a nine-year-old son named Gabriel.
Gabriel is bright, curious, and full of potential.
A few weeks into his kindergarten year in 2022, he was placed into Gnet's program.
We were told there are only options where Gnet's or homeschooling.
Feeling that I had no other choice, I agreed to Gnet's.
After the four years Gabriel has been enrolled in Genets, he has experienced constant turnover
of teachers and paraprofessionals.
Many of the teachers were not certified in special education and he has had over six
parapros in four years.
Gabriel's IEP requires him to have a one-on-one aid, but after all the aids left, the Genets
program took the one-on-one aid out of his IEP without my knowledge or consent.
IEP goals were not being met. Instead of trying to improve the Gnet's program took important
goals out of my child's IEP. Gabel is now in third grade. The school insists that he
is on a grade level reading, which is not true. My third grader is reading at level below
kindergarten. He is only given pre-K level work and he's not receiving instruction that
would allow him to make meaningful progress.
The problems are not just academic.
Gabriel and his Jeanette's classmates
are completely oscillated from their peers.
They're not allowed to interact with other students,
eat in the cafeteria or play on the playground.
They are often made to watch other children participate
in activities through classroom windows.
Gabriel has a gluten and dairy allergies,
and the cafeteria frequently has no safe food options for him.
During second grade, I packed his lunch every day.
Even then, Gabel often did not eat
because he was being severely bullied.
By the end of that year, my nine-year-old son
had lost nearly 30 pounds.
This nightmare is my son's reality
and is happening in Georgia Public School system.
In the past three years, I have repeatedly asked
for Gabel to be returned to a regular
special education classroom and get the support he needs there. Each time I
have been told that he must earn his way out of Genets, but the school has not
explained how to earn his way out. I want my son to succeed and learn alongside
his peers, but there is no clear or realistic path out of this program. I believe
the money spent on Genets would be far better invested in supports that allow
students to remain in inclusive school settings. When children with
disabilities are educated in regular classrooms but the support they need,
they are better prepared for adult life, independence and meaningful
employment. Thank you for allowing me to share a gable story. I hope it
urges you to make the right decision for my son and so many others by ending
and giving all Georgia children what they need to succeed.
All right, Justin.
Yes.
Hello.
My name is Justin Andre God, or you can call me Justin God, because I rather prefer both.
So today, I am in, okay, let me refresh, I'm so sorry.
So today, for my speech, I am going to talk about IPSE
and also everything else in my life.
So I am an official inclusive post-secondary education graduate
who accomplished Project CEDA, Georgia Lenn, and the GSE ideal program,
and even Project CEDA too, because I forgot about that part too.
since that already happened last year in 2025.
So, I was proud that I was accomplishing some of my classes for film,
when Project CEDA and the Ideal Program at GSU
and very blessed about it and I'm very proud of myself for doing all those things.
When I was attending the IPSE, I wanted to make new friends,
accomplished some of my ideal and filming classes.
Practice elevator speeches, learn about the large
disability community, family mentors and individuals with
disabilities from the Georgia Land Program, and finally,
I wanted to make good memories with my friends and family.
Actually, yeah, just friends and peers, especially family members,
from the ideal and the Georgia Land Program,
because I have very good people to help support a guide me,
because I need all the guidance that I need,
even though I'm still autistic,
just like the other disabled people
who are autistic as me.
But at least I had a good time with the people that I know,
and love who helped me get to some of my new parts
for my future, and very happy about it.
Now for my wife, I got a new awesome job at 23 East.
So let me tell you about that.
So 23 East Group is evolved with marketing,
communications firms, web design for nonprofits,
and social media platforms.
It's we've done like social media,
and I also do marketing,
because I'm officially an employee there right now.
I used to be an intern there back in 2023,
but now I am an employee there,
and even though I did the G's for Georgia this year.
And now for the rest of my life,
I make YouTube videos because I'm an official YouTuber
since I have a YouTube channel called,
I am just and I've done for 10 slash 11 years now
since I was 12 years old.
And I love building Legos because that is one
of my most favorite hobbies that I like to do.
And it's definitely a part of me
because it makes me for who I am
and I am such a creative person since I'm always into film
because I've been watching a lot of Marvel movies
which I'm totally obsessed with Marvel
because I am a huge Iron Man fan
and I'm just very happy about it.
And it makes me for who I am right now.
So that is my entire speech.
Since IPSE was a very good fit for me
and I'm glad I get to be part of the ideal program,
the Wend program, Project CEDA.
And let me look back at my speech really quick.
And yeah, also be part of the 23 East Group too,
because I'm blessed to have everything here
in Atlanta, Georgia, since already makes me happy
and I'm glad everyone let me get to those cool parts
for my future.
So that is my whole speech.
And I hope you enjoyed it,
because I want to make it nice and very zesterful.
So zessilator and I just want peace.
So Justin is an example of why Inclusive Education works.
I want to invite a champion of Inclusive Post-Secondary Education, Representative Katie
Dempsey, to say a few words, someone with personal ties.
Well, good afternoon.
I'm speaking to these guys back here.
Okay?
Welcome to your cap at all.
Yay!
We made sure we had a lot of people here today
to welcome you, okay?
About the biggest crowd we've ever had.
I think in the end this whole building today,
I know it was a little hard to navigate at times,
to walk around, but thank you for being here,
for telling your story, for encouraging others to do a program just like you are doing.
It's hard work.
You got to do well all the way through school to get to go to one of our colleges and do
an Ipsy program.
But I just want to say thank you and all who lead in this world and all who carry it forward
because the reality is there's a lot of ability standing on these stairs.
Thank y'all.
Good afternoon, my name is Crystal St. Pierre Stackpole, and I'm here to close this out.
I'm a member of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities.
I'm also a longtime educator.
Most importantly, I'm an advocate for my brother, Trey, that's 37 that has Down syndrome,
to advocate for other Georgians with disabilities.
I thank you for the evidence today
for why Georgia must change its educational system.
We need to make Ipsy grants permanent.
We need to get qualified retired teachers
back into our classrooms.
We need to fund therapeutic supports.
And for my buddy Gabriel, who is so special to my heart
and kids that go through the G-NATS program,
we have got to end the G-NATS program.
And most of all, we need to update QBE
to find what Georgia students need to succeed.
I have seen it with my own eyes as a teacher.
All of our children can learn if we do the right thing
and if we use the best practices of modern education.
Please join us in our advocacy
to invest in Georgia's children.
We'll now take questions.
Woo!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
You're gonna give me a little time, please.
All right.
Thank you all so much for being here
and bearing with us on the marble floor.
Do we have a question over here?
Are you okay with this?
I'm okay with this.
I'm okay with this.
We're gonna have a time.
I'm okay with this.
I'm okay with this.
Okay. No, thank you. The question was, do we have a timeline for getting rid of
genits and overhauling the QBE formula? Especially for QBE, this is going to
take a lot of players besides us, and there's been a big push lately of
different folks in the education community talking about that. What I would
like to see happen is a commission form to take action on meaningful QBE
reform. I think within the next, you know, what, two years, three years, because
QBE is massive, it's going to take some time.
With Genets, what we are hoping to see is a phased out approach, you don't want to just
shut the doors.
As much as we want everyone out of Genets right now, we need students to be supported in
their homeschools.
So what I would suggest is an approach similar to what was done with ending sub-minimum
wage for people with disabilities.
There was legislation passed last year, sponsored by Senator Hickman, that ended the antiquated
practice of being able to pay people with disabilities less than minimum wage.
That was legal at this time last year.
That practice is now being phased out over the next few years.
I think in all reality, a similar approach would be needed over the next few years to
phase out G-nets and bring those students into regular school with the supports they need
to succeed.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
other questions. All right. But in that case, that concludes our time. Those of us who spoke
will be available to speak afterward. Thank you all so much for being here and for advocating
for Georgia's children and youth.
