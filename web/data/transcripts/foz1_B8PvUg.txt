Now in the beginning of the second quarter of the session, I don't know who's ahead,
but it's clicking along here.
We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which
we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 52nd House District,
the Chair of the Mar-Talk Committee, Chairman Silcox.
Chairman Silcox.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning.
I'm delighted this morning to bring to you all
the Senior Pastor from Mount Vernon Baptist Church
in Sanny Springs, Dr. Aaron Minnecoff.
Dr. Minnecoff came to Mount Vernon in June of 2008
after completing his Masters of Dvenity,
in biblical and theological studies,
as well as his PhD in American Church history
from Southern seminary.
Prior to pastoral ministry, Aaron worked as a legislative
assistant to the late US Senator Mark O. Hatfield.
After leaving his career in politics,
he went on staff and served as an elder
at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.
While in seminary, Aaron served as an elder and interim pastor
at 3rd Avenue Baptist Church.
Aaron is the organizer and host of Feed My Sheet
and annual conference for pastors and church leaders
in the Atlanta area.
He also serves as the administrative team
of the Greater Atlanta Baptist Network,
where he leads a monthly pastors fellowship.
In addition to his pastoral ministry,
Aaron is a visiting lecturer at Reform Theological
Seminary in here in Atlanta,
and the author of Politics and Piety,
Baptist Social Reform in America.
1770 to 1860.
We are also joined this morning by his daughter Natalie,
as well as his interns.
And so please, we're delighted to hear from Dr. Minikoff.
Thank you, Speaker and Chairman.
It's so good to be here this morning.
I've had the same key chain for 25 years.
It's a seal of the United States Senate
where I did serve as a legislative assistant
for the late Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
I enjoyed my job and I enjoyed being in politics.
I felt like I was at the center of something big and important.
And sometimes when I hold that seal,
I think about the bill that I worked on,
seemingly night and day, S-88,
the local Empowerment and Flexibility Act.
It gave local governments a little more control over federal funds.
It never became a law, and I'm not here to lie before it this morning.
The senator must have known I'd be a little disappointed after the bill died because he
came to my desk to comfort me.
The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, comforting me, a young staffer.
He knew I probably felt like I wasted a whole year of my life that I failed.
Our work often seems futile.
More than one of you have lost a campaign.
All that time talking to voters, sharing ideas, raising money, only to fall a few votes
short.
There are bills that you've tried to pass, only to be blocked, or bills that you've tried
to block only to be unsuccessful.
You have felt the sting of disappointment and it's not just politics, it's all of work.
The plumber whose two-hour job takes all day.
The lawyer slapped down by a judge's verdict.
The single mom working two jobs who misses her daughter's basketball game again.
And it's not just work that seems futile, it's life.
I recently attended Friendship Baptist
for the funeral of Matthew Francis,
the son of my dear friend Wallace Francis,
one of the best receivers the Falcons ever had.
And a faithful Christian.
Wallace and Cheryl were good parents,
are good parents, but tragedy struck.
And I think there's nothing worse,
nothing that feels more futile than bearing your adult child.
Listen to the opening words from Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
What is man gained by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?
A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
This legislative session will come to an end.
makes them important decisions. Some of you will be in the news. Some of you then will retire.
Some won't be reelected. Someone else will eventually sit in your chair. You'll wonder what you did.
Your legacy will probably seem to you small. The same is true for me. I preach weekend and
week out I do my best to teach and shepherd a local church. I work hard and
someday someone else will stand in my place and I'll be a footnote on the church
history page at Mount Vernon's website if they have a church history page and
they probably won't. A generation goes and a generation comes life can
seem futile to all of us. Well I stand before you as a Christian minister but
But even secular scholars agree that the life and ministry of Jesus Christ appeared futile
too.
Jesus didn't have a good relationship with his brothers.
They wanted more from him.
Jesus never wrote a book or founded a nonprofit, and he had, at the time of his death, only
a few followers.
After his arrest, Jesus did not muster up his own defense.
He remained silent while they cooked up charges against him.
In his final hours, those he loved the most turned their back on him while he walked
to Calvary, bloodied and bruised by leather whips and hammered to a Roman cross.
Hanging there, Jesus knew that his life looked like a failure in the eyes of the world.
He knew his whole ministry appeared futile, and perhaps the words of Ecclesiastes crossed
his mind.
A generation goes and a generation comes.
looked like an end turned into a beginning,
Jesus upended failure.
The cross was no accident, no unfortunate turn of events
and no surprise to God the Father.
There's nothing futile about Jesus' work, about the cross.
As sure as your work, at least for this 40 days,
is legislating, and my work is pastoring,
As Big Bethel AME tells us, Jesus' work is saving.
Jesus saves.
That's His work, and He does it perfectly.
The Bible teaches that you and I are rebels
against a holy God, that we were born that way.
Each of us comes out of the womb
caring more about ourselves than others,
living life for our own glory,
and making decisions that are opposed
to his standards.
And the Bible has a word for that.
And it's not a fashionable word to say in our day.
The word is sin.
It's from the Greek that means to miss the mark.
We all miss the mark.
God's mark.
And missing the mark isn't a small matter in God's eye.
It's a big deal because God is holy.
Our sin against Him is therefore infinitely terrible.
And because of our sin, we deserve death and eternal punishment.
Our work won't save us.
Your good laws won't save you and my so-so preaching won't save me.
Jesus saves.
You need the work of Jesus Christ.
You need Christ to suffer in your place, to bear the punishment.
deserve for your rebellion against our holy God. Jesus died for sinners like you
and like me. He rose from the dead to prove it. And this is the gospel that's
been preached for two thousand years. No gospel, no Christianity, no gospel, no
hope. Occasionally when I rub that key chain in my pocket I recall how I once
someone saw myself at the center of something big and important, and if I'm honest, sometimes
when I'm talking and people are listening, I'm kind of tempted to think I'm kind of
a big deal.
And then I see the cross, and I remember Jesus says, and I realize a fresh that I am nothing
but a miserable center who deserves hell, and he is everything.
The Lord of the universe who took on flesh and walked through dirt and went to a cross
for individuals who frankly make a mess of the world every day, he is amazing.
And I pray, Son, I'm an Aaron boy, he's the boss.
So I pray that the Christians in your life are the humblest people that you know.
I pray if you're a Christian, the people around you would know you to be extraordinarily humble.
It doesn't mean you give in on your convictions not at all, but it does mean that you are marked
by something of the humility that can only come from recognizing that your God is big
and important and you are not.
And when your work seems futile, or when you think you're a big deal, or when you feel
crushed by the sin in your own heart, I pray that you would run to that cross and remember
Jesus says, His work is never futile and is always perfect.
Would you stand as we pray?
When they father you are Creator and Redeemer, the giver of every good thing, including
deliberative bodies like this one.
Give these legislators wisdom to manage the affairs of this great state.
May they see you and your work as bigger and even more important than anything.
And may they trust in you, in Jesus' name.
Amen.
Let's pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and true straw.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

be strictly enforced today or someone
will have to come back tomorrow and
do one. What that means is you better be ready. We're going to put you on the
clock when we call out your name. Chair recognizes representative Houston
Gaines for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning. Today we recognize X and Y chromosome
awareness day. Today we're recognizing the genetic condition and individuals with either
less than or more than two X or Y chromosomes and individuals genetic code. As common as
this condition is occurring in 1 in 400 males and 1 in 1000 females, fewer than 10% of cases
are ever properly diagnosed. The frequent misdiagnosis and these disorders can be a detrimental
to the societal, behavioral, and physical development of those affected. And yet for many
years there were few to no resources available to those who needed them.
Then in 2016, Dr. Amy Talboy and Dr. Sharon Close at Emory University offered hope to
these individuals through their work opening the extraordinary clinic.
As we celebrate the great strides made by these citizens, let us also take time to reflect
on how we can be supporters of those struggling.
Today is the day we bring much needed awareness to this condition across our state and we're
honored to have families and doctors in the gallery here with us today.
Thank y'all for being here, and thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Ballinger for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask other domestic violence advocates that serve with me in the House to join me.
I mean, today has stopped violence against women day.
As a house, we have passed significant measures to make it
to add its triangulation to the aggravated assault statute,
allowed domestic violence victims to break a lease,
and many other measures that have made it safer for Georgians.
And I would like all of my domestic violence advocates
in the house, in the gallery, please stand,
and we will welcome you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Hitchens for a morning order.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today, we gather in this house to celebrate the 48th annual Fireman's Day.
And Georgia, there are probably 30,000 firements,
70% of which are volunteers who do this job
for our society without any monetary compensation.
There are 900 local fire departments across this state.
They put the well-being of society
before their own personal health.
I worked together with them in my 43 years in state government.
They do a great job.
And at 2 o'clock, we're going to have an official ceremony
the south steps and I believe the governor is going to attend and we'll have a lot of
any firemen here, if any firemen are here, I guess they have it arrived yet, but let's
also give a round of applause for the firemen who worked day in and day out, 360 days a year,
24 hours a day to protect us. Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Gerald Green for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to continue the Southwest Georgia
recognition of famous individuals.
And as part of Black History Month,
I come this morning to talk about Rosie Greer,
who was born in Cuthbert, Georgia,
is an American actor, singer, Christian minister,
and former professional American football player.
He was a notable college football player
Pennsylvania State University, who earned a respective place in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
And Rosie is just one of those individuals that has come out of my region in Southwest
Georgia, and it is certainly with great pleasure this morning to recognize Rosie Greer from
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Bowdie for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It is a pleasure to rise this morning to welcome the women
of Junior Leads of Georgia on their 2020 Capitol Day.
The Junior League of Georgia stands strong with 13
leagues statewide and 10,000 members.
The State Public Affairs Committee monitors state
and federal legislation and advocates
or in their focus on areas of aid and protection,
education and health care.
They support and promote civic engagement through
programming and partnership in their local communities.
The Junior League of Georgia invites their legislators
to join them today for lunch and count 125 at noon.
Join me in welcoming to the People's House
the Junior League of Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Rick Williams for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Have leadership Baldwin up here in the gallery if y'all would stand up and be recognized.
Leadership students from Baldwin County.
Thank y'all very much.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, colleagues.
So we are welcoming a special group today,
George's citizens with third tick for all day of action.
And we had a great discussion on cybersecurity
this morning throughout our state.
And many of these citizens are going to be calling you
to the ropes to speak with you today.
So if you are a participant in this morning's day of action,
if you could please stand so that we could give you
a round of applause.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Belton for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Two decades ago, back in 2002, Georgia ranked near the very bottom on the SAT.
How many of you remember that?
Raise your hands.
A newspaper article and a prominent paper in Atlanta report that we were number 50.
That's right ladies and gentlemen, dead lasts on the most important measure of a student's
ability to enter college.
Behind Alabama, behind South Carolina, behind Louisiana, behind Mississippi.
But something happened at the end of that year.
The Republican governor, Sonny Perdue, was elected, and Republicans went to work restoring
local control, listening to our teachers, and returning authority back to the classroom.
Then Republicans started the very long and difficult process that was completed under
Republican Governor Nathan Diel and continued by Republican Brian Kemp and this General
Assembly of fully funding education for the very first time in recent history.
What are the results for the first time ever, Georgia beats a nation for four years in
the road on the ACT. We had the 13th best score on the NAP last year, the nation's report
card for the K-12 schools. We had recently with the 13th best AP scores in the nation,
and for two years in a row, not one, but two years in a row, we're above the national
average on the SAT. This terrific success of Georgia's children is due to the hard work
of our amazing Georgia teachers and Republican leadership.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
On the day that I welcome youth leadership,
Columbia County, who's been the balcony with us today,
it's quite appropriate that I also mentioned something
to you about Augusta University,
where some of these kids may go to school.
Augusta University is educating the next generation
of cyber professionals in inspiring future generations.
The Georgia Cyber Center represents a unique public-private
partnership that includes Augusta University,
Augusta Technical School, the Georgia GBI,
the Georgia Department of Defense,
and several other federal agencies that work together
to meet the workforce demand for cyber security
in our state.
In 2019, a gust of university signed a memorandum
of understanding with the US Army Cyber Center of Excellence
to share resources and help develop a cyber-trained
workforce through education, innovation, research,
and outreach.
For the past two summers, the university
has hosted the JIN Cyber Camps for high school students
teachers. The camps were sponsored by grants from the National Security Agency and the National
Science Center Foundation. Let's all congratulate the Georgia Cyber Center for the work they are
doing to help keep our Internet safe on this National Safer Internet Day. Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today I'd like to introduce you to Brian.
Brian is a sweet shy boy who loves to spend time with others.
He likes to hear the voices of his friends at school and on the school bus,
which he enjoys riding.
Brian regularly has friends from church and school come over to play the piano for him.
Brian enjoyed listening to all types of music.
Today I introduce you to Brian to highlight the plate of medically fragile children who are available for adoption in Georgia.
With these children requiring extra care, they give back an extra love and love is bipartisan.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Kinnerd for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Most of us in this room will not use anything we learned in school
from algebra class, geometry, calculus, nor will there be any functional application today
for most of us from the information gleaned from physics class, chemistry, or biology.
But what we will use today and every day of our life is social studies. Sociology, US
history, world history, civics, ethics, all assist our ability to understand the world
we live in, enhance our perspective and cultural understanding, it expands our empathy.
Research proves that students who receive effective social studies instructions are more
likely to be civically engaged or more likely to vote, to volunteer and work on community
issues.
Social studies has been marginalized in recent years as math and science have been elevated
and I would argue that as a direct result we are seeing more turmoil and conflict in
our world, increases in bigotry and hate.
The A.J.C. reported this morning that social studies could be taking another hit as we
are proposing reducing testing.
Social studies teachers and advocates are very concerned as they understand why gets
tested, gets taught.
My friend Debbie Daniels was the department leader of the social studies in Gwyneth County
for many years.
She says social studies is what we do for the rest of our life.
I agree.
I yield the will.
Chair recognizes Chairman Abstration for a morning order.
Ms. Speaker, today in Gwinnett County, the Board of Elections Office will be dedicated
for Beauty P. Baldwin, who is a constituent that I represent.
This Baldwin has served a distinguished career as an educator and as a member of the Gwinnett
County Elections Board.
Because of committee meetings, I'm unable to go to the dedication today at 4 p.m. but
I want to congratulate Beauty Baldwin on the well-deserved recognition and join with
of the members of the WANET delegation
in applauding her outstanding service.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative McLeod
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Big up to my colleagues.
Reflecting on the journey of Africans
to the Western Hemisphere is not the beginning
of our history or is it the end?
Although the exact numbers will never be known,
The transatlantic slave trade is believed to have forcibly displaced 12.5 million Africans
throughout the 17th and the 19th centuries.
Some 10.6 million survived the infamous middle passage across the Atlantic.
I ask for a moment of silent for the atrocities committed against these human beings.
history 366 days I yield a well. Chair recognizes representative Chocus for a
morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It is indeed an honor and a privilege for
me to recognize members of the Sumter County Fire and Rescue Officers and
fine rescue service. They're in the gallery. Please stand up, guys. I'm going to
read their names. Jerry Harmon is the chief, AB Lewis, Clint Bowley, Rick Bell,
David Baldwin, John Carroll, Mark Griggs, Hope Griggs, Chris Thoms, Piggy Lentoms,
Charles Horn, Chad Brown, Sabrina Ruta, Jameson Tyler, Heather Tyler, and
Michael Drewberry. And the thing that I want to point out about our firefighters
at home is the fact that we've got so many women in the fire department, so I would dare
to say that we've got the best-looking firefighters in the state of Georgia. We just had a fire
in my district of which several fire departments came out and helped out and lost two buildings
in Buonavista, so I want you all to join me in congratulating the firefighters from the
America's Rescue Service. Thank you. Thank you Mr.
Representative Carter for a morning order. Good morning. Thank you
Speaker Austin. Ladies and gentlemen know the House and our guests. Our moment in
black history. Did you know that Atlanta the city too busy to hate was once
must decide of a racist massacre that lasted four days when mobs of thousands attacked
and beat and slaughtered any black person they saw on Atlanta downtown street destroying
businesses homes at will.
It's true, even most Atlanta's, like myself, weren't aware that when they walked down
Peace Street, enter the five points marty station,
a go to class at Georgia State University.
They are in an area where 100 years ago,
as many as 10,000 white men were involved
in a violent rampage killing black people.
Today, the tens of thousands of people
who passed the Statue of Henry Grady
located at Marietta Street just blocks
from the CNN Center are probably oblivious to the fact
that the bodies of three black men were heaped in a bloody pile

Chair recognizes representative Mathy Ack
and representative Pullen for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This morning, Representative Matthew Ackin,
I'd like to welcome the Marine Baptist Church
to the state capital today.
They're appearing at the top left-hand corner.
And they have brought members from Pike County,
at Spaldon County and Henry County.
So I appreciate you guys coming up
and please come back and visit with us again.
It looks like our doctor of the day is going to require two members to introduce her.
Is that accurate?
Chair recognizes Representative Gardner and Chairman Perish to introduce the doctor of
the day.
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
It is my great pleasure to introduce to you, Dr. Cheryl Grabham, who is currently surgeon
in chief at Emory and in the Grady Health System.
She completed her medical training at Georgetown University, surgical residency at Washington
hospital center and received her MBA from the University of Connecticut School of Business.
Now normally we think about surgeons as people who just cut and sew.
But Dr. Graham does a lot of interesting things in our community.
Her current research focuses on decreasing disparities of breast cancer care through
a community education outreach program, and providing high quality care for breast cancer
patients at Grady Health System. We are very lucky to have Dr. Graham in our community,
and I welcome her here today.
Thank you, Representatives Gardner and Parrish. It is quite an honor to spend a day at the
I would like to read a quote from the American anthropologist William Ward that reminds me of the skills that each of you have and the work all of you perform every day on behalf of the citizens of Georgia.
Before you speak, listen, before you write, think, before you spend, earn, before you invest,
investigate, before you criticize, wait, before you pray, forgive, before you quit, try,
before you retire, save, before you die, give.
My most sincere gratitude for the many hours all of you generously give in your roles
as representatives for the state of Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The House will continue to be at order because we are about to recognize a very distinguished
guest and the clerk will read the caption to house resolution 1013. House
resolution 1013 by resident Taylor the hundred and seventy third green and
hundred fifty first parish the hundred fifty eighth Smith the hundred thirty
fourth gains the hundred seventeenth and others a resolution recognizing
February 4th 2020 as community health centers day and commending the Georgia
primary care association and for the purposes. Chair recognizes chairman
and Darlene Taylor for an invite resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
Today I share with you the mission of the Community Health Center System is to improve access
to comprehensive primary health care services.
Community Health Centers are known as federally qualified health centers because they receive
grant dollars to assist in providing health care to the uninsured and the underinsured.
County Health Centers in Georgia began their work over 50 years ago, partnering with communities
to bring access to health care and areas that are medically underserved. Currently, there
are 34 health center organizations, all non-profit 501C3s, governed by local boards that are
made up of community leaders and patients. Collectively, these 34 organizations have
of 229 clinic sites and 120 of Georgia's communities.
Many of these clinics are in rural communities.
In 2019, over 600,000 patients were served
at health centers.
On your desk is a map showing where health centers
are located in your districts.
As we strive to increase access to healthcare
in rural communities, health centers do their part
by providing for pregnant care for women
and pediatric care all across the state.
By working together, Southwest Georgia Primary Care
in Thomasville and my local obstetricians
were instrumental in keeping our vital OB services
available in South Georgia.
In the gallery are the community health centers
from all across the state and their staff.
Thank you for what you do.
Now please join me in welcoming Sarah Lang,
President of the Association.
Mr. Speaker, thank you and members of the House.
I'm Sarah Langs, CEO of Valley Healthcare in Columbus, Georgia.
I thank you for this opportunity to speak before you this morning.
I and colleagues from across the state met with a few of you last evening and this morning.
And there were themes that ran throughout the conversations that we had.
Some of those included comprehensive, patient-centered, community organizers, patient involvement
and engagement, and pharmacy services that were provided for members that didn't have
the opportunity and being able to provide services without consideration of the ability
to pay all of these just combined to define the community health center program throughout
the state. And we thank you for this day of recognizing community health centers as
C.H.C. Day here at the Capitol.
And as servant leaders, we also work with you
to make sure that the residents, the citizens of this state
receive the highest quality of care that we can provide,
and we welcome you, and thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're going to take a picture.
So you're going to come over here.
Yeah, you step forward, okay.
Can we all get in there?
You

Good morning.
Speaker Austin, leadership representative Kendrick, my fellow Bulldogs in the Chambers.
My name is Roy Hanley and I am a Cybersecurity Lawyer Professional here in the state of
Georgia.
I'm joined here this morning by Erica Moore with the Community Foundation of Georgia, of Atlanta
great Atlanta and Erica was a Facebook thank you for taking time this morning and letting
us speak to you for a brief moment during the time that I speak to you a cyber attack
will occur every thirty nine seconds seventy five personal records will be stolen every
Every second that I speak to you, those records contain the personal information of you,
your family, your friends, your colleagues, your constituents.
The State of Georgia has a very robust technology community, FinTech community, medical care
community, all of which contain personal identifiable and very sensitive information.
My challenge to you today is to help us the tens of thousands of cybersecurity professionals
in the state of Georgia to keep this information safe and secure.
What can you do to help us? Five things I'll ask of you this morning.
First, state and local governments are at the crosshairs of these types of attacks.
I worked with the city of Atlanta in its ransomware response and recovery.
Every community in the state is at risk.
You can provide two kits. You can provide resources to help these communities.
Secondly, you can provide rapid response and recovery teams and resources to help communities
that have been affected to respond.
Third, you can help educate and provide the resources for our state and local universities,
particularly rural areas to have and robust cyber security programs.
These programs will allow those students to go into the workforce and provide jobs to
Georgians, which are sorely needed.
Fourth, you can provide and pass comprehensive privacy and cybersecurity legislation.
And lastly, you can enable information sharing amongst the resources in Georgia.
This is a problem that affects each and every one of you, each and every one of us,
we need your help. Thank you.
You

Today we recognize Obesity Care Awareness Day in Georgia.
Recognizing that the disease of obesity is a major public health concern, which continues
to grow, it has increased more than 20 percent over the last 30 years in Georgia.
Researchers agree that this is a complex disease, greatly increasing the risk of developing
many other health-related conditions that are life-affecting and very expensive.
Prevention is important and it is also imperative that individuals and families and all affected
by this disease have access to and receive comprehensive care and treatment. Treatment
shown without bias or stigma from general society and health care professionals. We as policymakers
have the opportunity to regard obesity with the same level of seriousness with which we
regard all other chronic diseases.
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to allow Dr. Renee Hilton also to speak.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Dempsey.
Thank you to the House for having us here today.
So we are here today to spread awareness about obesity, a disease that we all know
too well, as it affects people across not only the country, the world, but has a profound
impact right here at home in our state of Georgia.
It is currently affecting one out of three adults in the state of Georgia and one out of
five adolescents.
Obesity is not all about the weight, though.
As Representative Dempsey has already said, it's also about the numerous medical problems
associated with it.
Things like hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, just to name a few.
Right now we have a treatment.
We have a cure and we have a preventative measure that we are not taking full effect of in
the state of Georgia.
Right now, Georgia is one of six states in the entire country not providing very atric
surgery access to our state employees.
That is something that we aim to change with your help.
Providing this benefit will not only make our state a better workforce and a healthier
workforce, but it is also financially responsible.
It will save our state money.
We can look to recuperate the full investment of surgery within 25 months.
Please come join us on the second floor as we tell you more about this disease in the
process.
And we've also brought our surgical robot so we would love to see how many of you fare
at the operating room table.
We'll walk you through your first case.
Thank you.
