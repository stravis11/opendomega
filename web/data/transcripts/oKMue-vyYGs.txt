TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you all for taking the opportunity to come today.
I'm Representative Carl Giljar from District 162.
And today we arise in the capital to the people's house to talk about saving lives.
Last year the Georgia General Assembly stood together in the House of Representatives to pass House Bill 465 unanimously.
House Bill 465 is the Autism Alert Act, which is a bill that focuses on saving lives modeled at the Maddie's Law.
That bill currently is in the Georgia State Senate.
Today we stand unified to focus on saving lives with three bills.
myself, Senator Donzella James, Representative Eric Bell, members of the Georgia General
Assembly, family members of the late Darren Lewis, those that would stand in the
fields of autism and disabilities and invisible disabilities such as Eric's ID
law. We're standing united. In March of 2025, Mr. Darren Lewis, a resident of Savannah, Georgia,
Chatham County, was just during the regular duties of a father, a husband, a grandfather,
an uncle, and a son of the city. There was a high-speed chase, unfortunately, in our city,
a residential district in a residential neighborhood. And why we do understand that the mission
of law enforcement is to get the quote unquote bad guy. At a point at some point in time,
I've always learned that things are not working in the manner we go back and we get into
a huddle and we cease and assist the play. And so there has to be some guidelines for
residential chases from law enforcement.
Mr. Darren Lewis lost his life.
Darren Lewis is one of those across the state
that have lost their life from alumni
from Morse Brown University to law enforcement,
to individuals all across the state of Georgia
that are civilian and law enforcement.
So that's why we have initiated a call to action
and to save lives with the Darren Lewis saving lives at House Bill 1011.
And so today we have the wife of Mr. Darren Lewis, a delegation from across the state,
students from Savannah State University and others that are standing with us today.
and we're gonna present Ms. Kathy Lewis
from the Darren Lewis Foundation.
Thank you, Representative Giljard.
Let me introduce myself.
I am the wife of the late Darren Lewis,
who was tragically killed on March the 18th, 2025.
My husband was simply leaving his house, going to a dentist appointment, and there was
a high-speed chase in my neighborhood.
When he left his house two minutes ago, he was gone.
It was tragic.
My husband was a great man.
He was a man with integrity.
He was a man that every woman dreamed of.
And I thank God for allowing me to experience that fairy tale marriage.
I thank Representative Carl Gail Yard.
I thank all my supporters behind me.
And we're here on the saving lives day.
I've lost my husband, but we can save other lives.
We can save your mother, your father, your sister,
your brother, your auntie.
What does Darren Lewis save a lives egg?
So I ask for all you guys support on this bill,
bill 101, Darren Lewis save a lives egg.
Thank you.
So it takes courage for Miss Lewis and other sustain with us on the day.
It hasn't even been a year.
Many of you have families that are autistic.
I come from a family of ten.
I'm the knee baby, but my younger brother is Down syndrome and autistic.
We understand the struggle of autistic families.
So, on today, I'm joined with my leader, the great senator and chairwoman of Urban Affairs,
Senator Danzela James, who has a very special announcement and very special guest about
Eric's ID law, Senator James.
I want to thank you all for being here for saving lives day at the State Capitol.
We need to save lives not just today but every day.
And I want to begin by thanking Representative Gillia,
and you can give him a hand because he's been out front
on so many issues that save lives.
Thank you.
Also, when we talk about saving lives,
we often think about emergencies after they happen.
But real public service also means preventing harm
before any situation may happen.
I thought I talked loud enough that I wouldn't even
leave this.
But as I was saying, we have really
worked hard to look at so many safety laws.
And as representative Gilear was saying,
Autism is something that is almost like an epidemic
in our school system now.
Even my second born grandchild, who is now 15 years old,
Bryce James is autistic.
He might be on the high spectrum
because he makes A's and can speak.
But at seven years old, he couldn't even talk.
He was nonverbal.
So now we're beginning to screen our kids sooner,
and we're finding out that we have so many of our babies
who are growing up with autism.
I'm very proud of a young man that is standing with us
because he was also on the high spectrum,
and he has now gotten his driver's license,
and he was one who was very, very interested
in not only himself, but his friends who also had disabilities,
or some kind of mental health condition.
So in moments of stress, though, he knew
that many of these young people may do something
that a police might misunderstand.
We want to train our police, but we
want them to know that we have a lot of some people
call them invisible disabilities,
because you can't just look at them and tell.
But if they had a driver's license,
like Eric, who's gonna talk in a little bit,
you'll find that if you have some kind of mark on there
and in his case in Maryland, they put a butterfly
and everybody who has any condition like autism,
the police would be able to see it immediately
and it would prevent so many problems.
My grandson, I told you, is 15 and now, he's six, two.
He's a tall, big guy.
He could be mistaken as a man.
And if he was in the car with people
and the police stopped him,
they always pulled these little kids out of the car.
They throw them on the ground sometime.
He wouldn't be able to take that.
He would probably be frail in his arms
or just confused about what was going on.
And some of the kids start running
and we have had people who had artism to get shot
and even kill in here in Georgia
within the past few years.
So I have introduced Senate Bill 419,
it bill 419 known as Eric's ID law and it is mimicked after Eric Carpenter
Granham's bill that passed in Maryland. He's here and he's going to talk to us
about an epiphany that he had after George Floyd was killed. Then Eric was
high functioning autism and he worried that the police may not recognize his
disability. All the ones of his friends like if at a traffic stop they might
pool all of them out. They might hurt someone and I definitely know that I don't
want them to hurt my grandson because they he didn't know what's going on. So
So Eric's ID is a simple tool that helps bridge the gap between individuals with non-apparent
disabilities and the people who support them.
Under this legislation, a person can choose to have a small butterfly placed on their
driver's license or on their state ID, indicating that they have a non-apparent disability.
This is well needed, it will help not just personally me and my grandson or representative
Gillian's brother, but it will help all these young people who have other disabilities
as well.
So the bill requires annual training for Georgia Peace Officers starting in 2027 on how
to interact, excuse me, with individuals
with non-appearant disabilities.
That training will include best practices
for communication, de-escalation and understanding
that notifying and notations mean what it means in real life.
So I will let at this time Erick's mother and Erick to come up
and tell you about the Maryland law because it's passed already.
So we have some things here in Georgia
that may already, if you go down a long list,
maybe find some of these disabilities,
but they're not being enforced when lives are being lost
or people with disabilities are being hurt by peace officers,
by the police, then it's not working.
So we need to do something to let these people know
that these young people may have some disability.
So at this time, I'd like to introduce you to Eric.
Can you come up?
And I'm going to let you introduce your mother
and just briefly tell us about your bill
because Senate Bill 419 is just like your bill.
And we hope it will pass just like your bill did.
So I will move for a minute.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I am Linda Carpenter-Grantham.
I am the mother of where is he?
This amazing 21-year-old is my son, Eric Bless Carpenter-Grantham.
And so I had a conversation with Eric once I realized that people with invisible disabilities,
especially autism, were being hurt harmed and killed by law enforcement.
So I had a conversation with Eric.
I said, Eric, if you're ever stopped by law enforcement, put your hands up.
Don't reach for your phone.
That could be very dangerous because he calls me for everything.
A lot of have autism, yell out my number,
and yell out someone called my mom.
Eric started to cry.
He said, mom, I could do that.
But the police might shoot my friends
that have autism and other disabilities
because we're all different on the spectrum.
Some of my friends have ADHD, they can't keep still.
Some of them have sensory issues
where they are sensitive to light and sound.
He said, mom, we gotta do something
and we got to do something now.
So I said, Eric, let's think it through.
He came to me a little later.
He said, Mom, I would like to put something
on the Maryland State IDs where we live
that will let the police know
that me and my friends have an invisible disability.
Eric is also a person that loves God
and he loves politics.
He said, Mom, can you take me to Congress?
I would like to have a conversation with the House Speaker
that would create some laws for me and my friends
to feel safe if we're ever stopped by the police.
I said, Eric, I'm so proud of you.
I'm going to do my best to get you there.
So we met with our Maryland State Center
that will see Smith, delegate Janelle Wilkins,
who's also the chairwoman of the Black Caucus,
and delegate Kim Taylor.
They were able to get this law passed.
It didn't pass the first round,
because we had opposition.
And we had opposition from people who are not of color,
trying to stop this law.
I don't teach my son to see color.
I teach him what God's word says.
Love thy name, but that means love everyone.
So, the delegates in the center
were able to finally get this bill passed this year.
But we were invited onto the view
would be Goldberg and we were invited on to the Sherry Shepherd show when we received
over a million views and comments to make this a national law. We are happy to report
the Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York have filed their bills for Eric's ID law.
We have people reaching out to us from other states to please help them get Eric's ID
law because they're concerned for their children and loved ones that have autism,
bipolar, whatever your invisible disability is. And if you're stopped by law
enforcement and you cannot communicate, this butterfly will help you do that.
And I'm going to let Eric talk to you about it. Thank you.
Good afternoon. It's great to be here in the great state of Georgia. I would like
to thank Finner, Dazzada James, and resident of Eric Bell
for inviting me and my mom.
My name is Eric Carpenter-Grantham.
I'm 21 years old from Maryland, and I am highly
functioning autistic, autistic.
A conversation with my mother, driven by her concern
for my safety, that lead me to creating Eric's ID law.
Oh, here we go.
My mother felt, if I ever be stopped by law enforcement,
I may not be able to respond at the man
that the police will suspect.
God had blessed me to create a special butterfly symbol
to be placed on IDs for people like me and other
to have available disabilities, like autism, mental health,
hearing impaired, and all hidden disabilities.
So the police stop us, they will know that they will know
that this person have a hidden disability.
The butterfly symbol resident, hope, peace, freedom,
and change.
My mother and I met with my Maryland State Center,
will see Smith who agreed to write the bill for Eric's ID law. Our sponsors for the bill for
Eric's ID law for the Maryland House of delegates were delegates and their Wilkins and delegate
Kim Taylor. We were blessed to receive over 48 extra delegates and 13 senators to co-sponsor
Eric's ID law, including our Maryland Senate president, Ms. the Bill Ferguson. Our Maryland state
governor, Wes Moore signed the bill into law on May 13, 2025. They immediately became affected
on October 1st, 2025. As of today, 10,829 murders have gotten the
butterfly symbol on their state IDs in the state of Maryland. Since being the
buyer on the view, with Ms. Ruby Goldberg and the Sherry Shepherd show, where we
have received a 1 million views and comments to make this a national law. We are
now meeting with Congress and other states that make this a law so that all
people hitting disabilities are safe. Being an autism person, being a person with autism,
I want the disability community to know that this law was created for you and me to feel safe
and have a voice. I want to thank God for using me and my mom to do hit the buying assignment.
Thank you God for being with us through this journey. But the journey has not been easy,
but the journey has not finished yet. Because in Olympians 413, you say it, I can do all things
who christian triffits me. In closing my mom always told me I was created to stand out not to fit in.
Please support Eric's ID law as we move this mission forward nationally so that all people in
villa with disabilities are safe. Let's make Georgia the past Eric's ID law because it's time
for change. This is not a white law or a black law. This is a law for every single person who
have an invisible disability that be safe into the world because they don't have a voice like me.
so I want to make this queer. I hear you, your lawmakers hear you, my mom can hear you,
and everybody in this room can hear you. Who don't have a voice, who I can't speak for,
and I'm speaking for others who look like me, who can't use their voice. Thank you all. God bless
you and God bless the great state of Georgia. And thank you to everyone who's here to support
Eric's ID law, Mr. King, my grandfather, and everybody else who's here to support Eric's
ID law.
Let's get it passed.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Can we give this young man another round of applause?
And also, can you give a round of applause for the Lewis family as well?
This takes courage for Georgia's up like these families to come here to make sure that
every Georgia is advocated for.
My name is Representative Eric Bell and I have the pleasure of carrying Eric's ID law
in the House of Representatives for the State of Georgia.
I want to thank Eric himself for having the courage to speak up for his friends and having
the foresight to know that others need help when they can't speak for themselves for
having the courage.
something. He said something and I hope all Georgians, all Americans in a time of
crisis have that same type of courage they are just displayed. Also like
St. Miss Grant him for raising a young man that can look outside of
himself and see that others are in need and see that if within him that he has
been blessed to help others. So thank you both for being here for what you've
done and I would just like to say let's do the work let's get this passed in
Georgia. This is in a black bill. This is in a white bill. This is in a red green or blue bill.
This is a good bill that saves lives and reduces harms. Thank you all and I yield the podium.
Everybody say saving lives. This is a great opportunity for Georgia.
Senator Don Zeller-Jane's representative, Eric Bell to our good brother, Eric, to the
Lewis family, Ms. Kathy Lewis, to all that are in this together.
We pray that you will help us, the general public, to educate and lobby for these bills.
To go and talk to your senators and your state representatives so that we can get a hearing
on these bills.
We pray that you educate others about the importance of saving lives just recently in our good
city of Savannah, Georgia.
We lost another young man just the other day on River Street that was shot down that had
a mental health issue.
We all understand that we got family members.
If not ourselves, a lot of us are on the couch, but a lot of us have invisible disabilities.
So this is a saving life bill, saving life bills in the center of the house, and we
ask for your support in helping us.
At this time, we're going to entertain any questions you might have.
I just want to let y'all know I'ma be brief this is a you've heard all like representative
tell you over and over this is not a black this is not a white issue this is a right issue
So this is an opportunity for us to do the right thing.
This is an opportunity for us to change things.
This is an opportunity for put legislation in place
that protects all people.
That's what we care about, we care about everyone.
So I just want to let y'all know when the other,
our counterparts was up here on this steps.
The whole surrounding section was quiet.
They were treated with respect.
But the whole time we couldn't even hear the mother what she was saying.
We couldn't even hear Eric what he was saying because everybody talking.
So why we can't get the same respect?
So, that's all I got to say.
You know, I just wanted to make sure that I speak
on the Darren Lewis field as well.
We've had incidents not just in Savannah,
but we can't bring our loved ones back.
One of my alumni, strong members at Mars Brown College,
went to pick her two grandchildren up
as she did every other Sunday for church.
And they got to, over near Morehouse College,
just a little church there, they attended.
And she was within a half a block
when the police from Clayton County
have been chasing someone and Atlanta police
was joining them and they crashed into that car too
and took the life of my good friend
who was a school teacher, she had gone on to get her PhD
to get her PhD as she had her two little grandchildren
with all three of them were killed right there on that spot.
So you'll see another bill because I think
we're gonna try to merge it into your bill.
And the bill is Senator Davenport's bill
and we've been working on it for three years.
Since we've been working on it,
sometimes bills that don't pass still get enacted
because some of the cities did pass a bill to stop the chases in neighborhoods and
Atlanta was one of them.
So we need to work together and make sure that we make this a state law.
And we will answer any questions, entertain any questions.
Thank you so much for coming out, thank everyone for attending.
Thank you.
