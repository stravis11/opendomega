you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Will you ring the bell, please? Well, good morning. The hour for a convening heaven arrived, all members will please take your seats. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. Doorkypers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Before I introduce the pastor of the day, which I have the distinct honor and pleasure to do such, I'm going to introduce someone else first. I want you to meet some of you who have already met her, but I want you all to meet the speaker of the house from the Georgia Youth Assembly, who is to my right. She is the speaker of the house for the 2023-2024 term, and that speaker of the house happens to have a father in this chamber. I want you to figure out who that is when I tell you that speaker of the house for the youth assembly is Ms. Kennedy. We, our Kennedy, have a stand up and let's give you a welcome. I can tell you she's been with me this morning. She does not have any of her father's bad habits. I want you to meet some of the people who have been with me this morning. It is my pleasure again to introduce the pastor of the day. I guess I'll do this part first. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. This morning it is my pleasure and honor to introduce our chaplain of the day. Our chaplain of the day is Ken Philback. He comes to us from a very successful ministry, is down in southeast Georgia, and now in South Carolina as well from the Compassion Church, which is centered and led by Cam Huxford in Savannah. But they have campuses across southeast Georgia, and Ken Philback leads the campus in Ruyken, Georgia, which is in Chairman Hitchens' district. But I am able to introduce Ken because I know him very well and because my son and his family and three granddaughters attend that church. Ken is also joined by his missions and outreach for the church. John Mark Roman, John Mark, if you will welcome John Mark to this assembly this morning. We would appreciate that. For you Marines in the room, John Mark is also a Marine. There you go, brother. I knew you could get that done. So we have quite the family affair down there. Let me tell you a little bit about Ken. He was born in Reardon, Texas, received his education in Texas, and served as associate pastor at the Northside Christian church in... That was broken arrow. So he comes to us, well educated, but like many of you, we have preachers in our lives, but not always pastors. And I can tell you that Ken has made an impact on my family. He's made an impact on daily myself. He's had a tremendous impact on the compassion church. Not only in Reardon, but the other campuses as well because of the quality of man he is, the divide God is. He receives that he imparts his members. And I can tell you that our son Wilson is a part of men's or Ken's prayer group. And it's meant a special part of Wilson's life. Because Wilson, because Ken is just a good ordinary guy. He likes to hunt and fish, and he cares about his family. He cares about his neighbor, and he brings God's word to that point. To that extent, I'll close with this introduction with this. And Daly and I have five grandchildren, three of those grandchildren, a ten Ken's church. Ken and his staff have led all three of those girls, set a twins, Lyle and Georgia, and their big sister, Elizabeth, to reclaim their professional faith and be baptized. So Ken and his family in that church will always, always have a special part of our family. So I want to welcome Ken Phil Beck. I want to thank Compassion Christian Church and the 10,000 lives that impact across South Georgia and South Carolina. So with no further ado, our champion of the day, a dear friend, Ken Phil Beck. Mr. Speaker, thank you for that introduction. And it was really nice. Those are the nice things people said about me ever. I want to, best piece of advice I got was from your son Wilson, who told me not to screw this up. So I'm going to do my best. To the distinguished members of the house, I want to say thank you for allowing me to be here today and just to be able to pray for you. I'm incredibly honored to be here and I want you to know that I am committing as a, in my own personal life, to pray for you consistently as a body. That strives to make this place Georgia, our home and to make it the best place to live. I want to thank you for the choice to serve this state and its people. And I'm going to pray that you will be the kind of leaders who don't just lead well, but lead with integrity, moral authority, grace, compassion, kindness, conviction, hope. Most importantly though, it depends on God. And I want to ask you just to do something with me. Maybe you've done this before. It's something that I have been forced to in a season of my life to do. I want you to think about your life in the end of your life, looking back on your life and what you want people to say about you. Now notice that I didn't say what you hope people will say about you. What will people say about you? What will your spouse, your kids, your family, your friends, your coworkers, what will they say about you? What kind of person were you? How did you lead? What kind of impact did you make? What kind of wife, husband, dad, friend were you? What difference did you make? I've been thinking about those questions because I realized that I'm a steward of the life that God has given me, that I'm leaving a legacy for my children, for their spouses, for my grandchildren, and for generations to come. And if I stood up here and talked about God without being owned by God, then what kind of legacy or what kind of example am I leaving? I was confronted with this just a couple of weeks ago when I was driving down the road in Rankin and got behind a guy who was driving 14 and a 35. Now I'm not an aggressive driver, not overly. I don't intentionally run people off the road or anything like that. And you may not struggle with this, but I can and I get frustrated with bad drivers. He was driving 14 and that 35 and for clarity, you know there are signs on the side of the road that indicate the speed at which you could travel. You can even go faster than that if you want a little risk in your life. But I didn't get too upset. I let him turn up in front of me. I was figuring I'm going to turn here. It'll be okay. He ended up turning on the same road that I did and it was 30 and he started going 12. Which again, I'm not good at math, but that's less than half. So I was getting a little animated. I was getting a little more frustrated and then he turned into the Duncan Donuts I go to. And then he proceeded to pull up to a parking place. And I don't know why people do this. I don't do it. I'm sure there's a good reason if you do it. But he pulled up to the parking space and then back then. And I thought why? I'm not in a hurry to get anywhere. So I parked and got out of my car and I walked into Duncan. As I walked in, he rolled down his window. And he said to me, wasn't going fast enough for you, huh? And I said, very calmly. I said, no, sir. You weren't. But it's okay because I drive behind stupid people all day long. I didn't say that. I may have thought it. I got my donuts and went to the church and thought about my legacy. And I came to two conclusions. One is there could just be really bad drivers out there. Or two, it could be that I think my time and my destination and my priorities are actually more important than yours. And if that's the case, then maybe the problem wasn't with him. Maybe the problems with me. Because if I live in a relationship with God without being owned by God and lying, that to impact my life, then what kind of legacy do I leave? And the truth is that my core, I can be kind of a selfish person. I don't have a problem considering what I want and what's important to me, but I can struggle sometimes to consider what's important for you. And I think that's the rub in a relationship with Jesus. In 1 John chapter 2, Jesus or John wrote, but those who obey God's word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him. Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. A life with Jesus is different than the culture that we live in. According to Jesus, we win when we lose. We game when we give. We get filled up when we empty ourselves. We're the greatest when we're the least. It's not first that brings satisfaction. It's actually last. And it's not about being served but serving. And that's the life you see as you follow Jesus through the gospels. And it's different. And sometimes it's counterintuitive to our lives. But if we live as Jesus did, he says that this is the kind of life that will bring you purpose and meaning and impact. And it's the life that people will talk about. And so I just want to remind you that all of us in this room, everyone of us are going to be remembered for something. All of us will be remembered. But what will we be remembered for? And so I challenge you to consider your life and your impact and your legacy. Because when we do, we discover that the things that are really important in life take us to a deeper place of meaning and purpose in our lives. Here on earth and in a relationship with Jesus. And I don't think you are ever more like Jesus than when you walk like he walked. I don't think our lives are ever more compelling to this world than we live like he lived. And as you think about your impact here and at home in this world, I'm going to leave you with one piece of encouragement that my wife has taught me. What matters most in your life is not the duration of your life, but the donation of your life. It's not about how long you live, but it's about how you live. Her favorite passage was Joshua 2911. And it says, for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you, not harm you and plans to give you a hope in the future. And I'm going to pray that you live well, that you lead well, because as she would say, God has great plans. And I'm going to pray that he would use you to accomplish his plans for our hope in our future. We stand up and pray with you. Father, I'm so incredibly grateful that you are not a God who is far away from us or uninvolved in our lives. But you're one that promises to walk with us beside us. I pray that we would trust in you with all of our hearts, that we would not lean into our own understanding, but instead acknowledge that you alone can provide provide the wisdom needed to lead, and that we would trust you to make our path straight. I pray that you would empower us to live lives that are pleasing to you, and that our choices and decisions would not come from a place of selfishness, but a place of submission to a God who loved us enough to demonstrate what servant leadership is, a God who was willing to send his son and a son who was willing to give his life for every one of us here. May we be people who live with compassionate hearts and kindness, humility, weakness, strength, and control patience. And I pray that we will bear with one another and forgive each other just as you have forgiven us. Father, I pray that your plans and your desires for our hope in our future would be what we pursue instead of our own. I want to thank you for these men and these women who have chosen to serve. And I pray that you would bless them, that you would lead them, protect them, give them clarity in wisdom, as they do the work of serving the people of Georgia. But may they always be led by the higher calling of serving you. And I pray this in your son's name, amen. We turn and do the pledge of allegiance. Let it do the pledge of the United States and America. And we do the work of it, will we withstand one nation and we are God and in the business, will liberty and justice for us. We'll stop right there and I'm going to give him a few. Thank you, Pastor. Those words are very meaningful to us all here and we appreciate it. We really do. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors. Members, you may join. Pass to fill back in the south any room for a photo and make his acquaintance. You You

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, 2024 is a very special year across the state of Georgia and our country. And the reason being, because in 1964, the Economic Opportunity Act was born, and it was a commitment by President Elinden Johnson to address poverty root causes inspired by the Comprehensive Vision, articulated once again by President Johnson and the spirit of Social Justice, championed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Community Action Program was born. For 60 years, community action agencies across the nation have been a beacon of hope in powering individuals, alleviating poverty and fostering the development of stronger communities. And we're so very proud to have in our gallery today, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, representatives of the Georgia Community Action Association. And we're going to ask if they are standing, as I call their names, we're so very proud to have with us and our Miss David Bradley, who is the National Executive Director for the National Community Action Foundation Association Foundation.

Very, very, and if you have a capone, please join the lady in the well. Give the lady your attention. Very important annual announcement as we bring attention to Lupus. And gentlemen, remember the admonition from the House. Remember the admonition not in front of the speaker. In front of the speaker, Representative Williams will get upset. We don't want to have that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House colleagues. And yes, I just thank you guys today as Lupus Awareness Day, Lupus Advocacy Day at the Capitol. I'm sorry. And we are here to recognize them for the work that they do 365 days of living with Lupus. So on behalf of the team that's upstairs and we have some that are in the Senate, I would like to ask them to stand and be recognized. They are the champions in the street, but we are the champions here in this House for Lupus. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Thank you, Ribbysins. Let's go feel. Appreciate your support for Lupus in this House. And welcome to the House. Thank you all for being here. Chairman Dickie and Chair Lady Smith recognize for a morning order. Chairman Weedauer. There you go. I'm Senator Campbell. Oh, great group. Oh, the Master Gardner himself. Chair Lady Smith. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for your attention today. I feel like we're in a smorgasbord of the State of Georgia. We've heard so many wonderful recognitions today. And to that name and group, we're going to add Georgia's Master Gardners. Some of our Master Gardners are up there. This is a service from the University of Georgia. This is why our University of Georgia residents are up here with me. At the University of Georgia, they have a program called the Extension Service. And it does multiple things with me. I actually took the test and passed it to become a Master Gardner. I was at 20 years ago. They reminded me of that. And it's the best thing I've ever done. And it's such a resource to our communities. There is something called the backyard Gardner's program that any novice or person who's skilled everything, they tried to grow, can get those programs and figure out what to do. So I want to take just a moment to congratulate them. This is their 45th year in Georgia. So it's their 45th anniversary. And it's the 50th anniversary nationally. So this is a phenomenal resource to our community. And I want to do a shout out as well to the University of Georgia as a land-grant university for doing what they do. So on your offices, you're going to find some basil seeds and little pods to grow basil. And you can do it. Even you guys. You all can do it. So this is a simple thing today. I'm going to yield my time and then turn my time over to the next person, Robert Dickie. Thank you, Chairman Smith. I just along those lines today's Green Day. Georgia Green Industry, many representatives are here today. From that, you should have received a plant in your offices too. And so just thank you, thank for that industry. Many of you have greenhouses, nurseries, and landscaping companies in your district. And life is really good in green in Georgia when those companies are doing well in planting sod and bushes around your businesses and houses. So thank that industry and thank them for the plants. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to our guests today and thanks for the plants. And we appreciate that. Thank you for being here. Representative Sheila Jones, you want to hold up a little bit on yours? Okay. I'm going to ask all members to come to the floor. Clerk, if you're ring the bill, all members come to the floor and take your seats, please. Thank you. Members will please come to the floor and take your seats. You don't need to be having any conversations. You'll need to give your attention to the lady and the well. Door keepers view closed the back door. Front door, whichever that is, I guess that's the front door. Thank you, members. Lady from down in South Georgia, chair Lady Penny Hauston is recognized for a morning order as long as she would like. Oh, I can talk. Thank you. Good morning. And I tell you, if I had heard the wonderful service that the minister delivered us this morning, I would probably have rewritten my speech. But I just want to thank for y'all. Remember, confession is good for the soul. And I'm going to make some confessions. I know it's hard to believe, but I have been lying about my age since I was 15 years old. I grew up in a small town, Larry Georgian, South Georgian, Calhoun County. And it's part of my friend, Gerald Green's District, but he was not the representative when I was 15. But soon after that, but anyway, in a rural area, the state patrols only came to the county once a month. And they came to Calhoun County early in the month, and I was still 15. So it was going to be 16 earlier later in the month. So my dad took me over to Morgan. I got my driver's license and lied. And it did not catch up with me until I went to get my social security. And my driver's license, inversitive, did not say the same thing. But I was a politician then, and they know politicians don't lie. So I got it straight now. But anyway, and I know it's hard for y'all to believe, but I have served under seven speakers. Speaker Murphy, Speaker Coleman, Speaker Richardson, Speaker Berkhalter, Speaker Ralston, and the first woman speaker of the House, Speaker Jan Jones, and Speaker Burns. And I want you to know, when we got Speaker Burns, we got two for one, when we got Burns and Dale. And I don't know where she is, but the people of Georgia need to thank her for how she's doing. I know some of y'all might not believe this, but this area over next to the Speaker's office, that was the smoking room. And we had so many friends we made on both sides of the aisle smoking, and we bonded. We bonded and told all color jokes and had the best time. That's where you went for the fun in the smoking room. And I know you're going to take this hard to believe. But I guess it was about the first year, so I was here, you know abortion wasn't a topic for women. But what really was a topic for women was that state health benefit plan did not pay for birth control. Now, they told us this, whether it was true or not, we were at the age of it, it was in the paper. You believe that, you know, now you don't. But they had told us that it paid for by Agri, we're not birth control. So we passed the bill in the house to the new employee for birth.

And it was not going past the Senate and Speaker Murphy was here and Speaker Murphy called all the women Republican Democrats and said y'all come with us And so we trotted behind him and he took us over to the Senate He said now line the wall and we just line the wall with women and he started calling Senators over there one by one and It passed and so And then Speaker Murphy said I want every woman Every woman represented you to be in my conference room right now and we didn't see everybody sat down and he passed that Cigars and we all had to smoke And that was the first cigar I had ever smoked Uh, but you know, uh, I know uh That some of you are not gonna believe this But uh if I if the good people in my district Reelected me and honored me by being a Representative when I finished the term I have lied and I would be 81 years old and And I just uh, I got to thinking about it and and it is time to go home It's time to to go back and be with my family. I have Six grandchildren who've never known anything for me of that being a representative and you know We're talking about dining everything. I'm not planning on dining time soon But I want to die in South Georgia But no plans for it either But uh, I have had a I cannot tell you what a wonderful experience this has been And the friends have made will last a lifetime. I've told some of the younger men in here And I actually look at one that you know They've got to remember that the shelf life of a representative is about 48 hours And not to take that you remember that But I should have added that if you are a representative your shelf life with another fellow Representative is a lifetime and that we are indeed families And this has been a wonderful experience and I've got so many friends through the years I'd like to remember but I'm afraid if I named a few I might leave somebody out and then there would be a friend anymore. So if you're not dead, I'm not going to name you But one of the greatest women I've ever known Walked up to me the first day that I was in the House of Representatives And she had on five-inch heels before it was popular way five-inch heels And that was my dear friend Jeanette Jamison and she Improved some of her wisdom on me about how things that were going on the house and I'll have to put that in the book I can't stand up in tell But uh, I had the privilege for years of sitting next to to John Metters And I voted John Metters machine more than he did because he never said you see But we got to be such good friends and J. Sharp J. Powell and I all three said Had the greatest passion for rural Georgia and we bonded with that and of course David Rolston It's big a time Murphy and my friend Richard Smith I had a I've had a passion for people with deaf and hard of hearing and I've worked in years ago to get some some different Bills past and had it not been for the compassion of Richard Smith none of these bills were gone And I'll always be grateful for him for what he did and for the friendship he shown us and if I've left anybody out I am sorry but uh I just could not I'm not gonna go home and do nothing now Passion was deaf and hard of hearing but it's my seatmate and friend knows my passion now is Dill Caffer rural Georgia and I plan to go home and advocate to have good dental care for rural Georgia And that is that is my plan. I'm I'm not gonna sit there and not be heard I love the people that I've represented and I'm so honored that they gave me this privilege and I'm gonna be that form and I want to be with them and I love them and I love this state and I love you And may God continue to to bless America and one other person The staff here that have supported me through the years and the house budget office and I don't want to call them Stabs. I want to call them friends. We have bonded. I've had they've been the best people working in this capital And I just want to thank them for their friendship and support and most of all I've hoped I have been a voice for rural Georgia and And I have tried to be a voice for people who don't have a voice and there are a lot of folks in this state who have no voice And I hope I've been a voice for him and thank you all for serving and God bless you. I love you and God bless America You You You Miss Penny as I've heard you called very lovingly Any number of times and um a couple other things I've heard But I certainly do not know In my lifetime and my service here of anyone Who you showed more compassion for their fellow man Whether they be in South Georgia rural Georgia or anywhere in Georgia than you have Because you care you care about the members of this house You've cared about the members of this house for a number of years and I know The members here respond To your caring by embracing you and certainly paying attention to you I've seen you um moves Some positive initiatives across the goal line without a problem And I've also seen you create the death knell for any other some other With just a couple of words from right over there So and I think that just demonstrates The respect and admiration that the members of this body have had for you in the past members that are now here anymore But certainly the new members that hear now certainly and those of us have been here for a few years Um grown to respect your wisdom But also you're caring and I think when you pair those two together It's a very powerful tool and what I heard her say And her remarks Or something that's Struck me as she said I'm not going to sit there and not be heard I said that's the truth She will not sit there. She won't go home and not be heard I know you will continue to be a champion and we're um We're excited about a dental school down in south Georgian that um is in our budget We're excited about that and I know that's been is and has been one of your passions So we we look forward to um certainly keeping you involved on that great project But again It's a bit of sweet day for this house When a member that has meant so much to Georgia makes this kind of announcement But it's a sweet day Because we know that you will enjoy life as you have over the years With your family with your grandchildren and your community And we look forward to continuing your good work for the people of Georgia Well, thank you so much.

That committee recommends a disbile do pass. The gentleman from the fifth Representative Barton has recognized to present the bill. Representative Barton. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today I have with me a House Bill 793. This bill simply just takes a speed bump out of the way so that social workers that are getting their master's degree can take the license and test the last semester of school. And that way they can get the hit the road running. And that's simply the only changes. No other requirements are changed. I see Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, you have a question. Sure. To your left, Representative Jasmine Clark has a question. Does the gentleman you? Yes, ma'am.

Is there an objection to agreeing to report the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that chair has done? Yes, sir. I'm glad you all worked hard to report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 793 the yeas are 167 the name is one the bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 987 987? House Bill 987 by reps of can in the 170 second and others to be entitled to act to amend code section 22 165 the fish go to Georgia annotated relating the equalization grants annual calculations and allocations those revised the definition of the term qualified local school system. This bill ever referred to committee on education that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. I know this gentleman knows a little bit about local government representing Chaz Cannon has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Miss Penny. I'm going to miss you greatly. Colleagues, I rise today to bring you House Bill 987. Most of you all are familiar with your local government raising or lowering their milled rates. In some cases that happens when local property values or assessments rise or fall and in response to that the local government on an annual basis adjust the milled rate up or down we hope down so that enough revenues from taxes are generated to cover expenses. That is basically what this bill does with respect to eligibility for equalization grants. The current threshold for state equalization grants was set five years ago in 2019 at 14 mills. Now the basic purpose of this millage threshold is to ensure that a local school system is taxing their local citizens for their fair share of K-12 education dollars. In 2019 this body set the baseline mill threshold for equalization eligibility at 14 mills. However there are two components for determining taxation at the local level. One is the milled rate of course number two is the value of property which is called the tax digest. Since 2019 as most of you know we've had a we've seen property values aka the tax digest rise in some cases significantly. According to the Department of Audits and Accounts in 2019 when the 14 milled threshold was established the total assessed value of property across the state was $466 billion. Last year in 2023 it was $641 billion. A 23% increase in value and likely higher if we had today's current values. In 2019 total revenue from property tax was $12.7 billion last year $17.3 billion. A 26% increase and again likely higher if we had today's values current numbers for 2024. But here's the key there's been no adjustment of the 14 mill threshold to accommodate for these increases over the past five years. In other words as you know a local government has been no rollback. So if a local school system and there are many throughout the state is hovering around the 14 to 16 mill threshold and they have experienced steady increases in property values. And as a result the school system is able to both a contribute the same level of local dollars towards education as in previous years and also be has the ability to lower their millage rate. They could now stand to lose their equalization funding if they drop below the 14 mill threshold set back in 2019. As a result there are school systems throughout the state who even though they are able to go lower are remaining at the required threshold of 14 mills because they don't want to put their equalization dollars or risk. And in doing so they're passing on sometimes significant property tax increases to the citizens year after year. So what this bill does is taken to account the increased property values we have seen across the state and it lowers that 14 mill threshold set five years ago to a new proposed threshold of 10 mills. The bill basically lowers our millage rate to accommodate for increased property assessments just as we might require a local government to do. It's important to note that all school systems that currently qualify for equalization dollars are above the new proposed 10 mill threshold. This bill does not address equalization or the formula for equalization. It's more of a tax digest bill that addresses rising property values over the past five years. I apologize for the extra level of detail but this is an important topic that not very many folks understand. I just want to try and make this clear as possible and finally I want to thank speaker pro-tum and my seatmate chairman Irwin for their guidance and crafting this legislation. And then my best clerk of the house voice I'd like to recommend this bill do pass. Well that I'll take any questions Mr. Speaker. Now you explained yourself into a lot of questions I can tell you that much. So gentlemen eels. I yield Mr. Speaker. You have a question to your left. The gentleman from the 16th representative Kelly is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker with the June and yield. I do. That was a pretty thorough explanation but it left me with a question. Yes sir. Did you say there's currently schools below the 14 mill threshold that are receiving equalization? I did not but there are. There are some school systems that are going below the 14 mill threshold and still receiving equalization. And so as a part of this bill you'll see them a very back page. There's a clawback provision that basically says if you go below the new proposed 10 mill threshold there'll be a penalty somewhat of a penalty of 25% of your equalization dollars that they'll pull back from you after the following year. So there is a penalty now there is no penalty in current law to address the school system that drops below the 14 mill currently. Thank you I appreciate that. Gentlemen you. Yes sir. I know already leader Beverly right in front of you has a question. Mr. Leader. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen you. Yes sir. Just a follow up to my dear friend representative Kelly's question. Do you know the school systems that are affected by this at this particular time and I have a second part to this question. Yes there are several there's about 104 school systems there in the 14 to 16 mill threshold. Okay and so if we go from 14 mills to 10 mills why isn't it not in this bill. So you're going to have a provision within this bill you go below 10 mills correct you're going to have a penalty potentially assessed this correct why wouldn't we tie that millage rate to a percentage of the population coming through as opposed to a hard fast number of 10 mills. I'm not sure understand the question. So instead of saying it's 14 mills mills where we are today we go to 10 but you're going to have population growth and what net and other areas cop. Sure. Where that mill is probably going to be you know in the next five seven years that's going to be a problem as well. Sure why not tie the millage rate to a percentage of the population that's either coming in or leaving account. Well the millage rates tied to the tax digest that's how we assess property tax and so I mean I agree at some point we might have to revisit this number and drop it either lower or raise it up but I think based on the assessments that have increased over the last five years that's why it needs to be lower down to 10 because to accommodate for those increases. Yes sir. Gentlemen you to chairman Corbett to your extreme right in the corner. Yes sir how you yield. Thank you miss speaker does gentlemen you. Yes sir. Is it not true that this bill has the potential to lower property taxes for thousands of Georgia citizens across the state. Is that not true? Thank you. Thank you for the bill. Chair Lady Houston to your right has a question. Is it not true that property values are going up more in rural areas with farmers than the money that the farmers make to feed you. The lady knows of what she speaks. And is it not true if we don't do some of the way some of these restrictions on farm land. We can all go hungry. Thank you but to have in this bill. And lady knows of what she speaks. To your left representing Becky Evans has a question if you will yield. How will you yield. Ladies, Dr. Knath for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentlemen yield. Yes ma'am. Yes so is it true that you and I discussed this legislation and I had some questions isn't it true that in the cab county our millage rate is I told you is the second highest in the state. I think that's correct. That's correct. And in the course of our discussion isn't it true that I learned that many of the counties with this lower millage rate do not give senior home state tax. I mean senior school tax exemptions. That's correct. We'll be up the county to do that. Right other counties. Yes so into into cabin and many of the urban counties we do give property tax exemptions significant ones to our seniors. And so that might be a reason. I don't know the reason why we have higher millage rates. But you would you but the gentleman like to explain like your reasoning when you said why in your county you don't give senior tax exemptions. Sure when you basically car value section of property does not is not raised or is not assessed properly or not assessed over time then that will certainly impact your military because you're not getting the tax digest as high as it could go. Some of the properties being removed from taxation and the result that digest is lowered. So if you're not just multiply times a millage rate you come up with a number. If it's a higher tax digest same thing multiply times a millage rate you get a higher number so that's the reason why. Yes thank you. Gentlemen has a couple other questions if you're yield. I will yield. Representative Talon said from House District 179 knows a little bit about school systems has a question. Gentlemen has recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker is gentleman yield. Representative is a true that this is a is more about really even property taxes for those systems that need it those communities as rural areas that need it the most. This has been talked about for many years but you brought it to the table this year and we appreciate it. That's correct. That took a couple of a couple of months so let's see from rural Georgia to urban Georgia. Representative Hilton has recognized for a question. Is it Scott Hilton to your left? Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen yield. A yield. A couple of questions. Is not true. Peachtree corner is a suburban Georgia rather than urban. Is it not true that our school systems have never been more funded than they are today. But the military system doesn't account for property values that are rising much quicker than the rate of inflation. That's correct. There's two components to property taxes. There's a military and there's also the property tax digest. Perfect. Thank you for bringing this bill. Mr. Speaker. The specific carder is recognized for a question. Is it a word? Did you yield the well? I attempted to before there was a communication from the minister speaker. Well we want to take one from representing during the court or I like her question so feel you're for one more. Yes Mr. Speaker. Be gentle. Oh this is very freely. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. First of all thank you. Yes ma'am. For the reform. The Georgia Constitution was a cap set 20 million. That's correct. For military and there are few school districts, and there are many schools that have a legal system that are not available. There are many schools that have a legal system that have a legal system that are available. But there are few schools that have a legal system that are available. That's correct. How would this legislation address that particular issue? Because what I've seen where it's supposed to be a referendum to allow you to set a rate of budget 20 million. But in my county they don't. So how would this help or sustain that Constitution? The Constitution of education. So the, and that's a function of the property tax, the property tax digest which is done by the assessor's office. If they present that to the school board, the school board is at 21 mils and they have enough digest to lower their military, they can certainly lower it back down below 20. And in this case down to 10 is still have equalization. Mr. Speaker I yield the will. Excellent decision. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The gentleman did yield the will. Is there any, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's done the previous question. Is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here's done the committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's another report the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House bill 987 the yeas or 161 the new member will vote no. The bill will have received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House bill 995 995 House bill 995 by the governor of the 73rd. Another is to be entitled back to amendment 12 of Article 6 of chapter 2 titled 20 the official go to Georgia annotated relating effectiveness of educational programs. So as required the administration of a nationally recognized multi aptitude battery assessment that measures developed abilities. This bill haven't heard the committee on education that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Bonner is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker colleagues today I rise to present House bill 995 this is legislation that was brought to us from our friends in the National Guard to help address some disparities in our recruiting numbers. The bill simply states that if there's a junior senior in one of our high schools that wants to take the ASVAB and that's the armed services vocational aptitude battery and on your desk there's a handout that tells you everything you'd want to know about this assessment. The bill simply says that if there's a junior senior that wants to take this assessment that the schools required to make them available and then the Department of Defense will take care of the rest they'll administer the test they'll provide any transportation as needed and they will cover all the costs associated with this test. And there's also a provision in the bill that if the parent or guardian of the child does not want them to take the exam that they're not required to do so. That's the bill Mr. Speaker I'll be happy to stand for any questions. The gentleman has a question representing Gladney to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you also Mr. Chairman. Does the gentleman use the well sir? I do. Sir is it not true that during the last last year in 2020 I'm sorry in 2022 there were over 8,000 active duty servicemen and women that were discharged from the military because they had denied taking the COVID vaccine. The Department of Defense reversed their decision allowing them to return to the service.

and only 43 of them returned. With that deficiency, we need this type of legislation in order to have that level of entries back into National Guard and reserve service members. Isn't that true? Well, thank the lady for the question. I certainly don't doubt those numbers at all. I'm aware of the policy the Department of Defense had and then its recent change. So I appreciate you drawing attention to that. I do think that this, what part of what this bill does is for not only for students but for parents, helps equip them with one more bit of information that helped them make the right choice after they graduate from high school. Thank you so much for bringing this legislation, sir. Would that Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration? General had a couple more, but he's yielded the well. He is there an objection to the previous question to be in order that Chair Hiznand, the previous question is ordered, is there an objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair Hiznand, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair Hiznand the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 995, the yeas are 173, the nays are two. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1020? 1020. House Bill 1020, by members of the Saints of the 180th to be entitled to amend Code Section 487, 40.1. The official code of Georgia annotated relating to tax credits for business enterprises and less developed areas. So it's revised the military zones that qualify for designation as less developed areas. This bill ever referred to the committee on small business development. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chairman Sains has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to come before the floor and discuss the modification to the military zone, opportunity tax credit. This bill simply modifies the credit to be eligible for use in areas that are not census tracks within a track that has an industrial park owned and operated by government entity. This still has a requirement that it has to be within an area that has a military garrison of at least 5,000 federal or military personnel. It just allows communities, it gives parity to those communities that can't invest on the front end to speculate where private business will occur. It makes sure our private businesses and entrepreneurs are leading in where to utilize this credit to ensure both our military veteran personnel and all our citizens within military communities have increased opportunity for jobs. It is eligible for businesses of creation of at least two jobs and more. So it's truly a small business and big business benefit to our Georgia economy. And with that, if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. You do have one question. I yield. My chart, minority leader Beverly has a question. I'm a recognize. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, General Yeal. I do. So these two or three jobs that are created, could they be in less developed census tracks than the next two, a place where a base may be, or is it just specifically for the county and the jurisdiction that the base exists in? It doesn't modify that the census track allowability my understanding is the census track or adjacent area. This bill does not modify the current area. It just modifies that it doesn't have to be in a track that has a industrial park. So it expands that eligibility. So the track can, but it has to be, the track has to be located wherever the military establishment is. Is that correct? I believe so. Okay. If that is how current the current law stands. Okay. All right. Thank you. Gentlemen, has another question from Representative Ballard? You'll for one more. One more. That's Representative Ballard. Every Chairman, sayings to your... Well, this bill, do you not agree that this bill will increase economic prosperity and job growth and creation in these military communities? I do. Our military communities are our great host to our personnel in Georgia. And this purely provides for both our veteran workforce, which we know is some of the highest skilled in our state and nation as well as those neighbors that are within those communities increased opportunity for new job growth. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. And if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1020, the yeas are 164, 174. The name is won. The bill, having received the requisite, cost-touchable majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 946, 946? House Bill 946 by ribs and the pockens, the 27th and others to be entitled to act to amend part 1 of Article 5A of Chapter 8 of Title 48 of the official go to Georgia and annotate relating to special district mass transportation sales and use tax. Sales are revised requirements for intergovernmental agreements. This bill emits committee on ways and means that committee recommends a disbilled due pass by committee substitute. Chairman, Hulkens is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In 2015, this body passed House Bill 170 creating a single county t-splots. Within that bill, it contained wording that said 100% of all those entities must be in agreement and sign the IGA. This bill changes that to 50% to be able to pass the IGA. If all agree, then it goes to a six-year IGA agreement. I've worked with ACCG and GMA on this issue. And it's nice to have those two bodies working together for once. And also, you'll see on your desk that the Georgia Chamber also supports this measure. That's the bill. Mr. Speaker, the no question. You have a question, Mr. Chairman. I think you should consider taking one. Yes, I will. If you want to be a chairman right on this House, Pro-Tim Jan Jones has a question. Well, thank you. Please recognize. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. Thank you. And is it not true that I support your bill? But is it not also true that it's important to clarify that this bill will not pertain to Fulton County, which represents 10% of the state's population? You're correct. The land of Fulton County is special. And is it not further true that the bill doesn't pertain because of legislation that I and others worked on a number of years ago that took Atlanta to 8.9% sales tax at their request, so that they could devote 1.5% sales tax to Marda and allow them, which they do, levy up to 0.4% for T-splots and that the remainder of Fulton County, those outside of the Atlanta borders, could levy up to 0.6% for T-splots. If 60% of the cities, if cities representing 60% of the population outside of Atlanta, agreed to it and they in fact have. You are very correct. Thank you, ma'am. The gentleman has no further questions. Thank you, sir. And he's yielded the well, and he's still a chairman. Is there an objection for the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 946, the yeas are 173. The nay is won. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 424 will be postponed to the next legislative day. That completes our rules calendar.

As many of you know now, some of you may not know that we lost a state trooper this morning as he had been called to an accident. Trooper first class, you see his foot, chase, reddener, succumb to his injuries, terrible loss of a young man, our hearts and our prayers go out to the family. I know you all join me in those thoughts. Representative Wade and some friends are recognized to honor this young gentleman. Representative Wade. Thank you, Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. Arise to recognize the life of one that gave that last full measure devotion to his fellow Georgians to serve others. I've had many texts and phone calls this morning as he was a graduate of Lumpkin County High School in 2011. District 9 that I represent, this gentleman has served his community well. The Dalson County Sheriff's Department of Lumpkin County Sheriff's Department said that he was a great partner in his role within the Department of Public Safety with lots of folks in Dalson County and in Lumpkin. The Dalson County Sheriff's Department said that they just wanted the folks in the house to know that he was always a cherished member of the family would always go above and beyond to help other men and women that were the blue. The George Department of Public Safety has sied in today to announce the line of duty death of true per first class Chase Redner Number 290. This morning, TFC Redner was investing in a vehicle crash on Interstate 75 North near Mount Zion Boulevard in Clayton County when he was struck by vehicle. TFC Redner was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital where he unfortunately succumbed his injuries. The investigation is being conducted by the Troop C Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team and his ongoing. But at this time, I would like the Georgia House to join the Department of Public Safety in sending our sincerest condolences and prayers to the TFC Redner's family and all of his co-workers, his friends and his community. Please keep Chase Redner and his family in your thoughts and prayers as they cope with this tragic and unfortunate loss. If you will all bow with me with a moment of silence. Heavenly Father, be with his family. Jesus name, amen. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. And thank you, House, tragic loss. Representative Tran is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Tran passes. Chairman Stevens. Jasper, Jasper, and Chairman Newton recognize for an afternoon order. Thank you, Miss Speaker. And this is one you can sit down on, ladies and gentlemen, it's an end again. Our sincere condolences are in the hands of the President. And it's an end again, our sincerest condolences to the family. What you have on your desk today is something that will get your attention and shock and awe, as we say, whenever we start this stuff, you'll look at a little printout from ACPI. We've been thought for years that our own insurance program, the State Health Benefit, basically paid pharmacies the same. Little did we know that they were running some of our independent pharmacies out of business. Bell's pharmacy had its last day, not because they were not competitive on this past Friday, but because they had a lot of teachers in their district, teachers, state patrol, all these other state employees, ladies and gentlemen, I think if you'll look at the sheet, you'll see that some of the change are getting paid as much as almost $90 for a prescription where these local pharmacies are being paid a dollar and 90 cents. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how in the world we have allowed this to happen. I'm asking the governor to step in with a full investigation. I can guarantee you that Department of Community Health had no idea this was going on. And here's the question we all ought to be asking, not so much about what we're paying our independent community pharmacies that have been there for some time for generations, more importantly, and especially to those folks that are self-insured, what are they billing you and your employees other than what they're telling you that they're paying the pharmacies? That's the question. I want to add, thank you, Chairman Stevens. Bell's pharmacy is in my community. It's down the street for me where they serve a small community of tape. If you go in there, pharmacy, when they reopened it five years ago, it's got marble countertops, because that's what tape does. It's the marble that's in this building. And when she closed Saturday, it's sad. You have the emotional, because I helped them. I helped them open. I helped them get their health certificates. I helped them get their pharmacy license. And now they're closed because of something we've done. It looks like. You know, Katie and her family have donated, or spent five years improving the lives of the people in tape. You should be worried, 30% of all independent pharmacies are going to close this year. That's in your community, wherever we are in Georgia, the one that you go to that you can call on Friday night, Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon, whatever it is closed. And they come and help you. I think it's something that Chairman Steve has really brought home. It's something we need to look into and address. These independent pharmacies are the backbone of health care in many communities. If you don't have a physician in your community, they're one of the backbones. And we need to support them. You know, it's a very, sorry, I got a little emotional, but you know, grew up in this world. It's important to hope and join in saving them. Just real quick, Mr. Speaker, just as a partner with the pharmacies and the work they're doing. If you pull out that sheet of paper, I think you'll be as shocked as I am to see the difference in numbers on what some chain pharmacies for. And I've got nothing against chain pharmacies. They're a crucial team member as well. But like Chairman Jasper said, in our rural communities and many of our communities, in some underserved areas, even of our big cities, the local independent pharmacist who lives and breathes in that business, make a tremendous difference. And I hope we can make some progress on it, least looking within our own house, which is state health benefits and finding out what's going on number one. Why are somebody getting 90, somebody getting $1.90 for the same prescription? And what are we being charged as Chairman Stevens mentioned? But if somebody being paid too much and if somebody else being paid way too little, we want to make sure we look into this. And I look forward to working with our team in the administration to find out number one. What's going on? And second, what do we need to do about it? To protect the next pharmacy from being in your needed area. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would just like to add a comment that these independent pharmacists are the people we go to church with. They coach our kids in Little League Baseball. And they give so much back to our community. They are in-home, in-home people in our towns. And they're not off from some large corporation and nothing against them. But we need to save our independent pharmacists. So I look forward to the opportunity to look at this question and possibly come with legislation that's going to address this issue. Thank you, gentlemen. Russ, it can't hurt his recognized foreign afternoon order represent Ken. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through it all, take me back. It won't be long soon and very soon. The blood will never lose its power. Can't nobody do me like Jesus. Those are just a few of the titles in the Andre Crouch song book. Today I rise for Black History to honor Andre Crouch, one of the more powerful and prolific songwriters in gospel music history. He was from the West Coast. He was part of the Church of God and Christ tradition. At a very early age, he was writing songs and connected to his musical talent. And his callings in the 1960s, he started his first group, Andre Crouch and the disciples. And immediately they lit the world on fire with their music. And the music and the songs of Andre Crouch started permeating the four corners of the earth. And it was a new sound. His sound was bold and groundbreaking. He's considered the father of the modern gospel era, the father of contemporary Christian music. And he paved the way for so many. No Andre Crouch, no Kirk Franklin. No Andre Crouch, no B.B. and C.C. No Andre Crouch, no Hezekiah Walker or Fred Hammond. And his music had a crossover appeal. It crossed over genres. It crossed over cultures. Black churches and white churches, both saying his music. And it crossed over from religious settings into secular spaces. He and his group were on the Mike Douglas show. We're on Johnny Carson, Saturday Night Live, our sitting at a hall. And then his music began to impact the film industry and TV. He was one of the choir directors on the Lion King soundtrack for Disney. He was hired by Quincy Jones to work on the color purple, the Steven Spielberg Alice Walker movie. That song towards the end of the movie. God is trying to tell you something. God is trying to tell you something. That's Andre's song. And he was nominated for an Oscar for that song. When Shug Avery in the Duke Joint sings Cele's Blue Sista, the singer on that was Tata Vega, Andre's singer. Michael Jackson, I'm starting with the man in the mirror. Oh yeah. That's Andre's choir on the backing voices. Madonna's song, Like a Prayer. I'll take you there. Guess who? Andre Kraus. He passed into eternity on 2015, but his music lives on and it continues to inspire us and to take us to heavenly places. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
