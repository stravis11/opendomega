If I can have your attention, please, it's a little different than why I normally say
at this time, isn't it?
That's because we're going to stand at ease till 10.30.
I guess because of the traffic, the testing lines downstairs are very, very long and we
You want everybody to get tested.
If you're in the chamber now and have not been tested, then leave and go get tested.
You're going to have time to do that.
So we'll come back in and take the role at 10.30 and start our business.

everybody's enjoying this beautiful Georgia weather today. I guess we need the rain. We will
begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chapel in after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chapel in this morning will be
introduced by the gentleman from the 22nd House District Representative
West Can Trail Representative Can Trail. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning
colleagues. It's my honor today to introduce you to my friend Matt Lawson. I've
known Matt for over 15 years. He came to our church a little over 16 years ago as our student
pastor. When all three of my kids were going through high school so he had a great positive
influence on my three children for which I'm forever indebted to him. After nine years
at our church he moved, took his family and moved to Burbank, California right there in the
suburbs of Los Angeles and started a church called Story City Church in Burbank and had
a very successful time. There are six years pastored there, started one church,
planted another, and then moved back to the area a little less than a year ago.
In January, he'll become the co-executive pastor at First Baptist Woodstock,
where I've had the honor of serving for the last 15 years. He's married to
Laura. They have three incredible kids, Deacon, Eden, and Roman, and I just ask you
to peripherally listen to what Matt has to share with us today. Thank you.
Well, good morning, Mr. Speaker, thank you for the privilege of being here this morning.
Bible says in Romans chapter 13, to honor those in authority, and I'm grateful this morning
to honor you.
It's grateful to be with you this morning.
You know, in October of 2020, David Brooks penned an article in the Atlantic magazine.
The essence of the article says, every 60 years, America experiences a cultural convulsion.
We experienced it in the 60s and 70s.
We experienced it in the early 1900s.
We did so in the 1820s and 30s.
We did so in the late 1700s.
And David Brooks says we're experiencing it again today.
He goes on to say that of every iteration
of those convulsions, America has come out stronger.
But he questions whether or not we can do so today.
The result of the cultural convulsion, he says,
has led to a distrust in institutions and people
unlike ever before.
Richard Edelman, CEO of Edelman Worldwide,
says, we are seeing an accelerated erosion of trust
and an epidemic of misinformation, the loss of belief
that what our leaders tell us bears any resemblance
to the truth.
So as a result of loss of trust and misinformation
our culture. The article goes on to say we're moving from a debate of ideas to a desire
for conquest. Dr. Eli Finkel, Northwestern University, says the debate going on is increasingly
divorced from ideas. It's not about ideas, he says. It's about conquest. It's about
defeating the bad people on the other side. And these identities, he says, are becoming
increasingly essential to who we are as a people.
Scientific American is quoted as saying,
we've moved from being polarized
to holding basic abhorrence for our opponents.
So in summary, the current cultural convulsion
that we're walking through today has led us to a place
where we don't trust the media, we don't trust leaders,
we don't trust institutions, we don't trust other people.
We're no longer debating ideas, we're trying to conquer people.
were possibly in the greatest crisis of our adult lifetimes.
And I believe in times of crisis, our cities and our state,
that people under our care need something from us as leaders.
They need a lot of things from us as leaders.
I just want to mention one this morning and then I'm going to pray.
And I think of utmost importance.
People under our care today, both your care and my care.
I have people under my care this morning as well.
times of crisis I believe people under our care above all things need leaders who
watch over our own souls. We need leaders who watch over our own souls.
Colossians chapter 4 verse 2 says devote yourselves to prayer. Being watchful and
thankful. You know when you read the ministry in the life of Jesus in the
gospels you find that there are moments of stillness that Jesus experienced.
Luke 5, 16 says, but Jesus often withdrew to the lonely places and He prayed.
Matthew 14, 23 says, and He went up to the mountain by Himself to pray.
And when it was evening, He was there alone.
John 6, 15 says.
So Jesus perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king
withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
Brother Lawrence, once pinned the words,
there is not in the world the kind of life,
more sweet and delightful than that
of a continual conversation with God.
Do you know what I believe as a leader of people
and people who are under our care?
I believe it's important.
It's valuable for us to understand
that moments of stillness and watching over our own souls
has significant value.
Every morning, I receive an email.
I receive an email between 7.30 and 8.30
every single morning that tells me
all the mentions that have happened
of our organization, both online and offline.
And I read those mentions online and offline.
And I know what's being said,
but I also know what's true.
Someone once said, all press is bad press.
I wonder if that person ever read emails
about what was being said about them the day before.
But you know what happens when I watch over my own soul?
I'm able to respond to criticism differently.
When I watch over my own soul, I'm able to see problems differently.
I'm able to provide better solutions.
I'm able to sit in someone's seat with empathy,
and I can honor people whom I disagree with.
That's what happens when I watch over my own soul.
I believe when we read the record of Scripture
see Jesus having these moments of stillness and quietness and watching over his own soul.
What we typically see in the moments afterwards are momentous occasions. Jesus was alone
with the Father. He spent a night in prayer the next moment in Luke 6. He chooses 12 disciples
who lead a world movement. Matthew chapter 26, Jesus has hours from going to the cross
and he spends moments away watching over his own soul and he's able to face that moment
with courage as the father would have him face it.
Two quotes and I'm done.
The famous church leader, the 20th century China watchman needs that our prayers lay the
track down on which God's power can come.
Like a mighty locomotive, his power is irresistible, but it cannot come without rails.
rails are, the power of prayer, pastor, one pastor also said,
time spent alone with God is not wasted. Now, why don't you
hear me this morning and I'm done. Time spent alone with God is
not wasted. It changes us. It changes our surroundings. And
every Christian who would live the life that counts and who
would have the power for service must take time to pray. Now
say to you this morning, very humbly, with all boldness, and all
courage this morning that a city, our city, my city, your city, our state, our
country, in times of crisis needs leaders. Watch over their own soul. Let's pray
together. Father, we thank you this morning for the privilege to serve you.
Romans chapter 13 reminds us all authority has been given by God and so God
to honor this morning those who have been given authority. God, I'm grateful for those
who are serving our state, our great state of Georgia this morning. God, I pray that they
would be men and women who watch over their own souls, who spend time and prayer, stillness
and solitude. God, knowing that those moments give us the power to respond differently,
to change, to provide better solutions, to honor people even when we disagree. Lord,
We thank you for another day you've given us we don't take it for granted the Bible says your mercies are new and your faithfulness is great
We love you in Jesus name. We pray amen and amen
A pledge allegiance
The United States of America and to the Republic on which it stands

The chair recognizes Speaker Ralston from morning order.
Thank you very much, Madam Speaker and good morning, again to members of the House.
I come before this body today to mark a painful and untimely passing, a truly great life
taken from us much too soon.
Last week we lost a shining beacon when WSB-TV anchor Jovita Moore passed from an aggressive
form of brain cancer.
She was not a Georgian by birth, but she became a Georgian.
She loved this city and this state, and she was loved back.
She became a lead evening anchor on WSB TV in 2012.
And for most of us, we only knew her through a television set, but she was in our homes
as often as members of our own family.
could always count on her to brighten up your day, even if but for a few minutes.
Her work reflected the high standards of professionalism, integrity, dignity, and grace.
Jovita Moore was just a class act.
And Emmy Award-winning journalist, she is survived by her mother, her two children, and
her stepdaughter.
Her family is in our prayers as her friends and colleagues at WSB TV and the entire Atlanta
media community is also, and I've heard so many comments from her colleagues in the
media over the past few weeks talking about her and it's amazing the regard in which
she was held.
I'd ask you to join with me in a moment of silence to honor the life and memory of
Joe V to Moore.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Mitchell
from Morning Order.
Thank you.
Today I rise to celebrate the monumental shift in our ability to protect our young school
aged children from COVID-19.
This week in the USA, we have a vaccine for our five to 11-year-old kids.
Two of my children, Valkyria and Faulkner, are six and seven.
I cannot overstate my relief.
This vaccine availability happened in the context
of having already devastated over 150 families in the US due
to a loss of one of their five to 11-year-old babies
from COVID here, and over 150,000 children
here in the USA facing life without a primary caregiver.
Right now, in Gwinnett County, our two-week incidence
infection in school-aged children reported by our health department as of this
Tuesday was 171 per 100,000 children. Overall in Georgia, incidents in
school-aged children is 190 per 100,000 children. Incidents in school-aged
children here in Georgia right now is classified as high. Prevention matters,
the ability to protect the physical and mental health of our children by
By preventing their illness and illness in their households matters, helping families
connect with the resources they need about pediatric vaccines, how to find information,
how to book them is one of the best steps we can take at this stage in the pandemic to
help forge a family.
Thank you, Speaker, and I yield the wealth.
Chair recognizes representative Bennett for a morning order.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, and good morning, colleagues.
Little when I rose this morning without wear
that Mr. Speaker would come and mix such an eloquent speech
or tribute to a legend, a lady, and a loving and kind spirit
in that of Mr. Javita Moore.
As it has been mentioned and in the award-winning news anchor,
Ms. Moore visited my family room, bedroom,
whatever room I was in and the TV was on.
And I always enjoyed her presentation.
She was a lady, a true saint.
So let me not repeat everything that the speaker has said
because I echo in him.
But what I do want us to remember and be reminded of
is that early detection may save your life.
And in the last year and a half,
many of us have avoided or have missed our annual checkups.
In October, we celebrated breast cancer awareness month.
I also celebrate prostate cancer awareness month.
Having my grandmother been lived today
and short after breast examination,
she may have lived more than six weeks after diagnosis
having breast cancer. And so once again to my beloved colleagues of this
esteemed house, get your checkups if you have not already done so. It may not,
but it just could save your life. Thank you Madam Speaker.
The clerk will read the caption to a group of privilege resolutions, honoring the life
and memory of Representative Lynn Moore James, honoring the life and memory of Joe Vita
more. Congratulating the Atlanta
Braves, recognizing commanding the
Clayton County Parks and Recreation
Department and for other purposes
that completes the reading of the
Provinces Resolutions. Is there any
objection to adopting the privilege
resolutions that Chair here's none
in the resolutions are adopted? We're
going on now to announcements.
The chair has an announcement, I want you to listen up very carefully if I could have your
attention.
Immediately upon adjournment, the ARC Atlanta Regional Commission caucus members will
be meeting here in the chamber. What I want non-ARC caucus members to do is
before you leave to clear off personal items from your desk and then exit
the chamber so they can begin their meeting. So all personal items take
them clear them off the top of your desk and so they can have the use of the
chamber to have their meeting. Chair recognizes the Transportation Committee Chair Chairman
Jasper's for an announcement. Thank you Mr. Speaker. The committee that brought us all
here this morning in the rain will have a meeting today at 1. This committee today is
is going to be going over some unique issues
about road-building construction bridges, truck configurations.
Non-members, I think you might want to watch this online.
It'll give you a good basic understanding
of road construction.
It'll be online, and I hope you take the time to be there
and be at our meeting today.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
