TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
You
I'm going to go ahead and call the Senate Health and Human Services Committee to order.
Reverend Jackson, Senator Jackson, if you don't mind, open this up in prayer.
Thank you so much.
Let us pray.
God, we give you thanks for the opportunity to gather with one another.
We pray for all who are in the health and human resources area and field.
We pray especially for those who are sick, who are lonely and afraid.
We ask that you would help us to make good decisions that all might find comfort and well-being.
Amen.
Thank you.
We have four house bills and one Senate resolution today.
And we had the meeting for one hour.
So we can go ahead and sort of just sort of go down the list there.
House bill 143, representative of Mathis, a few of mine coming up and we do have a, we
do have a substitute for you.
Let me make sure you have that is LC-339515S.
I apologize.
Do you mind sharing it?
Senator Eckles is, you know, y'all had companion bills in the house in the Senate,
and hers is in the house now, and I just wanted to make sure that the language mirrored
each other. The change, and I'll apologize to not giving you a heads up on this, I thought
you had, but it's a very minor change. If you'll look online, 13 continuous glucose
monitors as a benefit under Medicaid via the most cost effective benefit delivery channel,
and that was what was agreed upon. You got to remember this continuous glucose monitors
which we're all in favor of, but the ones to administer, the Medicaid is DCH, and this
is the language that made them comfortable, and so that's sort of where we are.
I didn't think you would have any, we always want to be, you know what, it's a good idea,
if I turn my mind, that would be better.
So if you don't mind just being brief, because we've heard this bill, and that's where
there we are, the floor is yours.
Yeah, we were just changing the governor's office.
I've wanted to be the most cost effective
instead of a medical deformity.
And that is the only change, everything else does you sign.
Does the committee have any questions
for the author or Senator Eccles or myself
since we have a little bit of change?
We have no question.
So if we'll enter, like to enter a motion.
Mr. Chairman, I make a motion do pass.
Do pass and we've got a second.
Let me say if, let me make sure that the, where are we?
Nobody signed up to testify any further discussion
because we've already heard this bill and no further discussion.
If you have a question, the distinguished rules chair.
Chairman, briefly, can we go over the changes again?
Okay, so in line 13, it starts on 12 coverage for continuous glucose monitors as a benefit
under Medicaid via the most cost effective benefit delivery channel.
And that's it, DCH and the executive branch, I wanted to make sure that we had that language
in there to make it more doable from their perspective.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Any other questions or discussion?
We've had a motion to do pass and it's LC-339515S and we've had a second and all those
in favor say aye.
All those opposed, like, sign, pass unanimously.
Thank you so much.
We appreciate it.
Thank you, Ms. Carey.
I presume Senator Eckles would carry this since it's her bill.
She's carried it already there.
Thank you.
We got it.
Thank you.
All right, chair lady Cooper, we're going to move you up in the agenda there.
And then we'll do Representative Townsend.
We got House Bill 309.
If you give us just a minute to get that bill in front of us.
And you had the podium House Bill 309.
It is coming to us without a substitute there.
Okay, you ready?
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I have House Bill 309.
This is a department bill two years, three years ago,
when we made some major changes trying to protect people
who moved into assisted living facilities.
And one of them is that we wanted to make sure
the people that opened these facilities
were financially stable and able to run these
so that we wouldn't have them closing.
In doing that, we put in some things
where we were going to ask certified public CPAs
to certify certain things.
Well, when the department started working this out,
the CPA said they don't do things that way.
So this just clears up the language so that it meets
what we wanted to just to protect
and make sure people were financially able
to run these facilities,
but so that the CPAs could do what they normally do
when they give an evaluation of somebody's finances.
Do we have any questions from the committee?
Senator Satsr.
It was Chairman, to the lady. Is there, are there standards that are already established
that say this is what solid, what financial stability means, are there cash reserve requirements,
are there things like that that are established, or have this not yet been established before?
No, I think, and Joe Hood is here with me if I might be allowed to answer it, but it's my understanding that CPAs have sort of guidelines about how they evaluate this kind of situation.
Could you help clarify the situation?
Joe?
Anything further, please.
Yes, sir.
Just, if you don't mind going to the mic and just identifying yourself.
Good afternoon. My name is Joe Hood. I'm the Chief Operating Officer for the Georgia
Department of Community Health. To your question, sir, we will rely upon a certified public
account to certify the pro-foam of financial statements or audited financial statements
depending on what's available to, and what, and their concern, and the reason for the
change is originally we had asked that they certify that the business was a going concern
in a positive statement and they've stated that they cannot do that.
What they can do is that they can state in the negative.
In other words, they would state that we do not see any findings or efforts that show
that the business is not a going concern.
There's nothing relative to say that we should be concerned about.
And we had to limit it to one year worth of financial statements
versus the two years that's currently in statute.
Mr. Chair, the only reason I asked the question is does this give any more authority to establish
sort of a baseline requirement?
I asked that because I know there's been some facilities when we were dealing a couple
years ago with pregnancy homes, they had to maintain.
What I thought was a very high level of cash reserves on hand, that was meant to have
out of the department.
Are we creating an issue that gives rise to that kind of rulemaking?
We're not seeking or establishing a standard in that way, it would just be a statement by the Certified Public Accountant that they're attesting that they don't see an issue that that's aware in the financial statements that, you know, for the business to operate within the upcoming year, given the scope of the licensee.
transparency is yes basically got you okay any other questions any further
no questions happy to entertain a motion from vice chair yeah be happy to move
do pass to House bill 309 33 92 95 is the else you know second from Senator
Huff settler any further discussion all those in favor say aye all those opposed
Those like son pass unanimously.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Who's, who's carrying that bill?
Do we establish them?
You carry it?
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
She doesn't have enough bills as it is, so she don't, OK.
I got you.
Thank you.
So, we're representative Townsend.
We're on a house bill 181.
And by the way, we didn't have anybody signing up
to test five for 309.
181, I understand you had a little amount of testimony.
I think it was 10 hours, maybe 12 hours,
five, 12 hours, only five committee meetings.
I'm sorry, I didn't have your mic on.
So that was 12 hours of testimony, five committee meetings,
and a couple of rewrites here there.
So every, I understand all parties are in agreement.
They are, sir.
We worked well together at some bipartisan bill.
It's what we hooked up with the creative ministry
as well to make sure that we monitor it well
and make sure the bad actors aren't bad actors anymore.
So what we're trying to do is make it a safer place
for Georgians.
Well, we sure appreciate Jones' diligent work
in the house, and if you don't mind taking us through the bill, 181, and any updates
that we need to know about the floor's years.
I'd be glad to, and I think we're speaking from the same one, LC-339513S.
Okay, I'm just making sure.
Okay, basically it started off as a constituent-based issue.
We had a couple issues.
I'm an educator, not known for being in the medical field, and we had two.
Two young men, one who committed suicide,
he was on other drugs as well.
Cratum was one of them.
And one of the causes of death was Cratum.
They said that led to that.
Second one where he was given Cratum at a half way house
like the other student and other people
to get off other drugs such as opioids.
Unfortunately, while he did that,
developed psychotic behaviors.
He wound up at a mental health institution
and just got transferred about a week and a half ago
from St. Simon's to Augusta to get additional mental health care.
That's how I came across my desk and I'm a freshman and I'm like,
okay, what can we do and we start looking into it?
Then we asked medical professionals and one thing we realized real quick,
it wasn't labeled at all.
So if you buy something off the store shelf and convenient stores,
you're not sure what you're getting.
You're not sure if you're getting a heavy dose or light dose,
a tainted dose or whatever kind of dose it is or no dose.
And so we learned real quick, we had to do more things.
You guys passed the bill a few years ago.
I believe it was led by voting Jones,
where it was just basically had to be 18.
That was pretty much it.
What we tried to do is make it a lot more safer
for Georgians than that bill wise.
So we need your help to do that in the process,
like we said, we picked up.
And so we put amounts on there.
The dosage has to be labeled.
It has to be labeled effectively.
It has to be behind the counter.
You have to be 21 years, 21, 8, 21 or older for that to happen.
It does not allow for vaping anymore, that product.
It does allow for business owners who do it the right way.
We met a couple of one from Atlanta area nearby here and one from the
loan that actually did it the right way and labeled it and
make sure her constituents knew what she was selling.
And that's what we're going for in this bill is to make sure it is
done in the proper manner.
Yes, I'm trying to keep it short and sweet, Mr. Chair.
If you have any other questions, I'd
be glad to answer it.
The biggest thing was, getting to label correctly,
making sure it is what the people know
what they're putting in their bodies,
and make sure there's a little enforcement to it as well.
The first, it does allow for the, if it
manufactures, it doesn't do it properly.
The first defense will be a Mr.
Meanor, the second defense would be a felony.
So they do they get that pass and we're not going after the store owner or the
constituent if the manufacturer doesn't do a popular or the distributor it's
not it's not the store owners fault if they catch it just because they
receive the shipment or if somebody buys it that way it's not their fault as
well so no harm for them if that happens and there's more in there I'd
be glad to go over and answer any questions I can Mr. Chair thank you
I represent Townsend, I know that we've had one or two discussions on this bill too.
Yes sir.
And I think we do have some questions from the committee, my vice chair, sort of
Kirkpatrick.
Thank you.
Yes ma'am.
I, we've been having a fairly robust discussion about some other products, but in the Senate.
But what I wanted to ask is which department is accountable for sort of being in charge
of this whole process?
I can't see a department that's accountable for it anywhere.
I'm sure it's in a code section, but...
Yeah, basically it would be, you know, help them.
Law enforcement, basically. Yeah.
It basically law enforcement, enforcing it as in if it's behind the counter,
and if it's not labeled crackly or...
Crackly.
Okay.
And we've talked to Sheriff's Organization and the Chief Supplies,
and we have their support as well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for my ignorance. I'm not exactly sure what
CREDIM is and I've done a little bit of research before I walked in. I heard of it.
Is there a medical use or their prescription there?
It's not a medical use for it. No, it's not a prescription. We talked about going
that direction first. The first bill, we're just going to ban it totally.
And then as we got more into it, worked with the Cain and Ministry.
That part was lowered to an extent.
but basically it's an over-the-counter food product from Southeast Asia.
It's on the danger of less from DEA.
You will see opponents of cratum, such as mayo,
clemenclinic others, and you have others who profess to endorse it.
So it's one of those where it's not monitored right now.
It's not regulated at all.
It's not a safe substance for George's to take right now.
It's considered an over-the-counter food supplement.
It is.
Can I follow up?
Sure.
One question I have is I read somewhere
that it can be used as an aid to come off of pain mass.
Is that...
Have you heard...
Through...
Yeah, the 12 hours of testimony, I talked to many professionals.
One of them here was Dr. Lopez and George
poison control center. One of the things we've learned is if they use it the right
manner, such as the low doses we're talking about, or some people use just the
leaves, the substance itself, the plant base, that's the leaf form, that are the
powdered from crushed leaves. You won't see you see people like that who are
using it properly to get through their pain or whatever else. It's when they
start up in the dose or putting the other products in there or the
a daltradicine or using this I equated to now with this bill. It's like alcohol. You
can go out and buy a case and you can drink it in one day, you can drink it over 12 days
or 24 days. 12 days, 24 days a case and I can hurt you if you drink one or two a day. Two
cans of beer. Same way with this bill with cratum is it still allows for that down the
road just like any other substance where you can abuse it if you really want it to, but
you really have to try hard to do it. Right now you don't have to try hard to do that.
Okay. Thank you. And the age was increased from 18 to 21 also. Yes sir. Any other
German huff statler?
I've got a question on it, but I was going to state I believe it works on the mu receptors
Which is the same that the opioids work on the bodies. It was very mild, but on the same receptors
But you've got in here that it can't be smoked. I mean it that's kind of unenforceful at none of our
That's going to be hard when it probably keeps some of your vape shops who are just to advertise
it that way.
Just smoke it and vape it.
It's like anything else if you want to really abuse it you can go home and abuse it and
do what you want.
Not much we can do about that, but it wouldn't limit the bad actors from advertising that
way.
Good.
We're encouraging others.
Right now you'll see some kids for some reason.
I think it's because it's like when I stopped home I live in South Georgia and I stopped
and make it on the way back to make sure I can get through our sixteen and how that goes.
And I was a little tired, so I had the choice of a
cratum right there for on the counter,
skittles, knickers, five-hour energy.
It's like, which one do I take?
Well, I knew better than take the cratum.
So that's the kind of the situation in now where it's not
a good situation.
Any other questions from the committee?
We did have some folks sign up for this.
We had Jerry Keane sign up.
You can certainly become an introduced yourself
and tell us who you represent and podium years.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I'm here on behalf of the American Cradle Association,
which is 15 million users around the country
and over 200,000 in Georgia.
We're here to support Representative Townsend
his good work to make sure those products remain available
to the consumer in a healthy, safe way.
Unfortunately, like many other industries,
there are those, as Representative said,
are bad actors who mislabel, who adulterate the product,
and then cause problems.
But for many, many Georgians and millions
across the country, this is a valuable product
that they use, including two or three members
of the General Assembly.
And we want to keep safe access to them
while at the same time protecting Georgia consumers.
So we support this bill in its current form.
We've encouraged a committee to vote it out in its current form.
So we can get it back across for a degree and down the governor's office and we will join 45 other states
in passing a consumer protection bill protecting consumers rights to use
credit but also penalizing the bad actors.
Thank you.
Any questions for Mr. King?
Just, you brought it up so I apologize just for my education.
45 other states do regulate this.
Yes.
And are they behind the counter most of them?
No, some are and some are not.
Okay.
And did they mostly, and did they increase it
from 18 to 21, or is 21 to age?
No, we're one of the few that did that.
So it's gonna be even stricter here at the most days.
Okay, any other questions?
Okay, we're creating questions here.
Sorry about that.
The bill on line 56 says it shall be modified
chemically or otherwise, but then when you get back
They've talked about salts, isomers, optical isomers, salts
of their isomers.
I mean, that sounds like a chemical modification to me
if it's the same as some other products.
Well, no, when the product is manufacturing process,
there are food products only that are used to modify.
The problem center is that the bad actors use some other stuff
that's pretty dangerous by itself to mix with this.
There's a lot of counterfeiters out there
what Representative Townsend's done,
so we put labeling dosage amounts,
what the products are,
they can only be used food,
approved food additives to process it,
and no other items.
And if we find out someone's adulterating the product,
then we've got a penalty mechanism built in.
But if you're creating these isomers,
it may be food products,
but you're chemically modifying the food product
to get there with solvents and acids.
I am I'm I'm I'm not sure about that part of it. Okay. Well, I I'm really not
able to address that directly other than that. The product when it's presented in the right
dosage is it poses no threat. It's when it's adulterated or abused in the amount of dosage that
presents a problem. We have a poison control expert here, right? Yes, a
You have probably Dr. Lobas could answer that question for us, maybe.
Dr. Lopez, just introduce yourself.
Give us your background quickly and we may repeat the question for you if we need to.
Good afternoon, everyone.
My name is Gay Lord Lopez.
I'm the executive director of the Georgia Poison Center.
I've been there now for 34 years.
There's our poison centers, the only poison center
in the state of Georgia.
Great.
And Chairman Huffsell,
do you mind repeating the question?
What my question is,
early in the bill, it says it shall not be,
you know, it's gotta be natural, great on plant,
shall not be modified chemically or otherwise,
processed or synthesized,
or otherwise treated in any way.
And then you go back to the products and it's saying
it can any quantity of these products,
including their salts, isomers, optical isomers,
salts of their isomers and salts of these optical isomers.
You know what I'm talking about, that's on line.
Well, I guess it's 11, is this the same?
Oh, this is a different bill.
Miners stuck together, I'm sorry.
Yeah, that's the, that paper club up there, you know?
Okay, all right.
So we're not doing, there's nothing used in the process
that does that then, I'm.
All right, who's gonna dissect this force?
Mr. Ken, you sound like you would like to.
All righty, okay.
Yes sir.
Thank you Chair, my name is Eli Cohen,
I'm also the most attest five.
I'm an attorney at the Weatherington Law firm
and I have the lawsuits that are suing the credit ministry
for credit and products causing my client's death.
And we have worked with the American Creative Association.
We were both in favor of this bill.
Tantzier question center, that point
about should not be otherwise modified.
The finality of that line is that increases the product's
strength, because what you have is
credit and sold generally in two different forms.
So you'll have it in raw leaf or like powdered form, right?
And this is generally just like the leaf
as it would have come off the tree.
But then what you also get is you get companies
that synthesize and make extracts.
And this is an incredibly potent form of cratum.
And that's what this bill is really focusing on
is these extra potent cratum.
So for example, the powders often sold in powders
or pill forms, it would take 26 of these pills
to equal this small amount.
So that's what that bill is focusing on.
Ensuring that cratum cannot be enhanced
in order to over strengthen it,
because that's what's going to kill Georgians.
We have it all in here.
So yeah.
I'm trying to do it quick.
Senator Lovis wants you to what else
there in your pockets there.
I got you.
All right, we're good.
We're good.
Senator Satsler, floor cheers.
Thank you.
That was one of my questions that was going to be about the distillation of it.
I heard some states have made the schedule one, which means just not available.
How many states have made the schedule one?
It's my understanding that if six states that currently have it banned completely, I think
Mr. Kean stood up and told you to tell you that one or two of those are
considering. Ms. King, get to the mic if you don't mind.
Vermont just rolled that back and to regulation and Rhode Island's in the process
Speaker of the House is carrying the bill up there. So how many states now I guess is the question?
45 regulated. 45 regulated. So there are five where it's banned. One of
those is in the process of rolling it back. And the USDA DEA chose not to
regulate this treated as a food supplement they did not weigh in on it and
that's if you remember correctly some of you were here that that's Chairman
Mullis passed a bill out of this committee relating to Cratham and so
that's it's it's been an ongoing issue and we're tightening up further
regulation that we're carrying that forward.
Great. Thank you.
The thrust of my question was really the percentages.
I mean, I've heard the examples of where the leaves themselves
are having effect and that's sort of how people became aware of it.
And then the distilled version is what's much more potent.
What are we talking about in the context of the Four Corners' Bill?
What is authorized in terms of the distilled product?
How distilled is that?
And how do we understand what we're voting on here?
Sure, so in line 61 through 63,
that goes over the actual specific numbers.
So there's two main alkaloids, or one alkaloid,
and one metabolite inside of cratum.
The main alkaloid is metragene,
and that is the substance that attaches
to the immunoid period receptor
to give you those opiate-like responses.
And that is a product that is less dangerous
than the second alkaloid, which is then seven hydroxymetragene.
That is a highly dangerous one,
and even the A.K.A. has testified
for the General Assembly that that is the danger substance,
that is the thing that can really kill you.
And we have limited that in both amounts per milligram,
so how much you can have as a ratio of the entire product,
and amounts per serving in order to make sure
that you can't serve an ultra-strong product.
For example, this product would become outlawed in Georgia
if this bill passed, the product that killed my client.
So that's where we really get to the heart of making sure
that these kind of extra strong products
are not authorized in Georgia,
and then tightening up the labeling requirements,
and then actually putting some teeth behind it.
Because currently, while Georgia has a credit regulation,
it has no teeth that has no enforcement mechanism.
So the desired end state is to create
those enforcement mechanisms for law enforcement.
For the questions from the committee.
I appreciate that.
So we've gotten everybody on the list,
except Mr. Jeff Breedlove, he is also if needed,
he is waving and we appreciate that.
Representative Townsend, I'll let you have the last word
and then we'll do the will of the committee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'll ask you for your favorable vote on this.
We've come with the industry.
We've come with medical professionals.
We had quite a few more, as you would know,
in 12 hours the testimony to testify before you.
But I promise we'll keep it a limited group.
I think you've heard from all everybody
that we work together and work well together.
That's what's nice.
And that's what I think we're supposed to do here
in the legislature.
And I just appreciate your committee here in this.
And again, thank you so much for your time.
We appreciate that.
I like your definition of working well together.
So the, but I have seen bills has been worse.
So we're good.
So I want to make sure we've exhausted all questions
from the committee.
No questions, everybody feels comfortable.
Got you.
We have a motion from Senator Brass,
Chamber of Brass.
Motion do pass, LC339513S.
Okay, we'll make sure we got the S on there
and the correct number.
So we have a motion, we have a.
We're doing 181.
We have a second, second, Senator Jackson
and any further discussion.
All those in favor, let's raise our hand.
All right, so it's unanimous, okay.
All right, so thank you very much.
Senator Townsend, did any, who had,
refers to my memory on who was carrying this?
Senator Albers.
Senator Albers, okay.
You guys have got a great one that would also.
Okay, all righty, so we'll got you.
Okay, thank you.
I was asking if Representative LeHood was here.
he was high beside Senator Lucas there.
So if you give us a minute to get to 497,
House Bill 497, Representative LeHood,
let's see it passed unanimously out of the house.
And okay, so the floor is yours,
everybody, is everybody on 497?
Okay, all right, floor is yours.
House Bill 497 is a bill with broad support from two departments. One is the Department
of Corrections, the others, the Department of Community Health.
And what section one does is simply take certified medication aids and applies the same
language that they are working under today in assisted living communities and skilled
nursing centers and a planet to state correctional institutions and the
Department of Corrections has asked for this bill and the reason is because of
well it's been proven that medications can be safely administered with
certified medication aids over the last decade plus in these other settings and
And also, there's, you know, severe workforce challenges in health care, namely, and this
bill would help to alleviate some of those.
So again, there's a lot of underlying language here, but it's just simply restating what's
already happening in these other workplaces.
And Section 2 pertains to certified nursing assistants and how they become certified.
And what I've done here is work with the department to establish professional and educational
experience standards that must be met for a certified nursing assistant candidate to
sit for the test.
So no standards are being changed.
The same testing standards will remain in place, but the requirements to be eligible to
to take the test, the department's gonna look at that
and put some reasonable standards
and for professional and educational experience.
And I'll be glad to take questions if there are any.
Senator Hatchett.
Thank you, Representative.
And I just wanted to say I was able to speak
to the Georgia Department of Corrections folks
and I know the new commissioner is all on board this bill.
So I just wanna say thank you for bringing it.
Thank you.
I see in line 39 that they will be administering a commercially-repaired
enum on still the physician. Did the physicians put you up to carrying this bill?
Yeah, I think they were tired of giving in them as to they wanted the nurses'
medication needs to start doing that.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Any other pertinent questions there?
All right.
They have follow up here.
Thank you. I'm not going to ask you about animals, but
what I did want to just clear up is
I don't see the qualifications
that make someone certified medication aid in here
and I know the department.
you said they were going to write that up but if we're already doing that in
assisted living there probably some in existence already and I just didn't
know what those were. Right so Mr. Hood here could speak to that if needed but
there is a pathway to become a certified medication aid and the prerequisite
is that the candidate first has to be a certified nurse's aid and then they
take a medication aid course which is pretty short it can happen over one or
two days and then they take a test that's a state test to state standards and there's
a database that the department manages in correlation with a certified nursing assistant database.
Thank you.
All right.
Any other questions?
We have a couple of folks that signed Sheila Humberstone and John Watson.
I think they're if needed, both are waving in support, both are in full support, and anything
further to add?
If there's no other questions.
Any questions?
I'd be happy to entertain a motion.
Have a motion to do pass on LC-339-442S from Senator Jackson, House Bill 497, second by
Senator Kirkpatrick, any further discussion?
All those in favor say aye.
All those opposed, same sign, passes unanimously.
Thank you, and Representative LaHood, who was carrying that for you?
I've spoken to my friend Senator Eccles, and she's agreed to carry it.
Okay, great, okay, thank you.
All right, thank you.
All right, thank you.
And last but not least, Senator James.
We appreciate that the yeah, if you might want to back up and I think you can move that
There we go. That's good take your time
It's almost out of power
If this charge I know what's going on it's tired of me all right. We're on Senate resolution 250
Center James
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
This is a resolution urging the City of East Point and the City of South Fulton to take
joint action to activate the East Point and South Fulton Hospital authorities to establish
a new hospital to serve the citizens of South Fulton.
You know, it's been a recent closure of the Atlanta Medical Center, South, as well as
the other medical center in downtown Atlanta.
And it adversely affected our area, and this leaves more than 150,000 people without
access to emergency health care.
And consequently, it also poses a problem for the world's busiest airport with the nearest
hospital being approximately 10 miles or more, which is in downtown Atlanta.
So I have worked with Senator, how, rather, Councilman Joshua Butler in East Point, and
about 10 other Council persons in South Fulton, one in Heyville, one in East Point.
are all in that area where the hospital closed and is affecting us not having anyone there.
And I've talked to about 200 medical professionals, mostly doctors who were at one of those
hospitals of steel servant in Wellstar.
And they've been meeting like almost every week to see what we could do.
And the reason we're asking for a hospital authority is because the sources of money for
a new hospital, if we aren't able to purchase the existing brick and mortar place that was
the well-stuffed.
If we can't purchase that, we have a place laying already on Camp Creek Parkway that
is available.
We have money sources, but we need a hospital authority.
I've talked to, I've gone before both of the City Councils for East, for East Point as
well as for the City of South Fulton. And we had a meeting November 9th, that was our first.
Since then we've had three other meetings and we've had numerous conference calls.
So everybody is a board, but we need to have our CON and also our hospital authority.
And we can get that if we create a hospital, a joint hospital authority.
And so that's what we're trying to do now.
And this will just give us an opportunity to go to the next level.
So hopefully by this time next year we'll have a new hospital.
So I asked for your favorable consideration,
but I can answer any questions that you may have.
Certainly, any questions from the,
you got a couple of questions.
We're gonna go with Senator Brass with his hand up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and...
Thank you, Senator James, for bringing this forward.
I'm curious, what's gonna be the strategy
on the certificate of need?
You said 10 miles is the closest hospital.
hospital closest hospital we we just had a hearing a few weeks back on a new
potential hospital and had strong opposition from hospitals that were
exactly 10 miles away so is there some strategy I'm unaware of that could
help no grates is the hospital that I was referring to that was over 10
miles that were a little over 10 miles away. And they are now the trauma unit. They have
to service all of Georgia. And so we still need a hospital in our area that can service
everything. Hey, Bill, East Point College Park, Union City, Fairview, Palmetto, Chattahoo
Chieels, the city of South Fulton. And I might be leaving now. Palmetto, do you say Palmetto?
Yes, that's your city. Palmetto and Chattahoo Chieels. So, yeah, I think it's certainly
an area that's going to be underserved and I'm just I'm just wondering how in the world
we're going to get a certificate in need when they won't just the department doesn't seem
to want to we've been working with nobody wants to support that just seems like
by to work with well star still we're not trying to well star is one of the ones opposing
well they might the last hospital that was 10 miles from them okay this might not be
a problem because they won the only other one both of them close that was
servicing those in and grates now has a huge risk more responsibility than
they've had before so we've talked to will saw we were trying to see if they
would give us the CON that they have already and so we've been what they say to
that they want to see money they want to know what we're talking about so we
We don't, the doctors who I've been working with want to sit down with them because many
of them are employed, I will start still.
And so they're not going to leave.
Plus, we have some of the other medical schools, including the More High School of Medicine
that's interested, and they told us we have to get to a certain point, and they'll come
join us.
But we have to be organized more, and they want us to be organized.
We know we've had probably more than 35 means and we are organized to be all professionals
but they want us to have a hospital authority so we can be under it or we need to identify
a private and a public source of money that will back up what they get.
And we do have money that so many different groups are offering but we want to be under
the state so that it'll be all authorized and that's what happens with the
hospital authority. All those places can get a hospital authority according to
our Georgia law by just requesting it and they can join with any other
hospital authorities that is in the area and so that's why we've talked to
more than just those two cities because we want to know what they want to do.
Or a quick one last question, Mr. Chairman, if you'll allow, do we have to hospital authorities, do we have to set those up in statute?
Or did they do that locally?
No, we don't.
It's done locally.
See you later.
That's, yeah.
I don't.
We?
So authority goes through CON?
No.
No.
Do you know that?
No.
They put on their own authority.
Okay.
I'm just never dealt with a hospital authority in my seven years. I'm just trying to learn here.
I would legislate a council can answer that too.
There's a general law that as the center said basically authorizes every city and county
at the state to activate their hospital authority. So what they would be doing is they
would have to have a city council or if you have a county called the county commission basically
the adoption of life resolutions that they want to do this.
So we'll take action on the part of that as well,
that we'll go back to the activities.
So our general counsel said that there is general law
and both city councils would have to enact their resolutions
to form an authority.
Did I?
That's right.
All right.
Senator Lucas, you got a question.
Let me just say I'm that this is only a resolution,
And so, you know, I don't, I don't sell problem with it, no problem from Senator Lucas Kirkpatrick, Senator Kirkpatrick.
Yeah, I certainly think there is a need and if we didn't have to go through this sort of going to need process,
we wouldn't even be having this conversation. But, so if you, did you say you've sat down with Wellstar about trying to get their, um,
CON, East Point, and some of the doctors, including Dr. John Ross, who I've been talking to almost
every day for months now, is there. They have been in talks where they actually sit down trying
to find out if they would be able to get the CON from them. And also, we can get a CON from
Any of the other hospitals that have closed within the past 12 months, but we'd have to be in negotiate. Yes, the COM will stand for Georgia.
Follow up, Mr. Chair. I thought that the CON of the hospitals being moved had to be within
certain number of miles, maybe three or like some small number of miles.
We have federal support, too, from some of our elected researchers.
So this is an urging resolution, and any further questions from the committee?
No.
Move do pass from Senator Sessler, second, Senator Brass, all those in favor.
say aye. All those opposed like son passes unanimously. Thank you committee. We appreciate
that. Thank you, Senator James and thank you everyone. So we have our final meeting at
three o'clock on Wednesday to make sure everything gets out to the rules committee in time
and that's it, any further business if not meeting adjourn.
You
