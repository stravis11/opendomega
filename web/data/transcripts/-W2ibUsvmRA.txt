TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everybody morning morning everybody thank you for all showing up this morning
didn't take long to spend a night. Last night. We're going to open up today our
meeting and leader eagerly to open us up with a word of prayer please. Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Let us pray. Oh God our health and ages pass our hope for years to
come. We come at this moment thanking you for your many blessings. We thank you
for the fresh new mercies that you have given us this morning. We ask now for your wisdom
and we ask for extra measure of courage as we deliberate the important issues facing
us today. We also ask you Father to bless the families that we have left behind, protect
them and keep them all safe and keep us continually in your care. In the name of Jesus, I pray,
Thank you very much.
Okay, for folks that are warning to ask for your legislation today, listen up just a minute.
Listen up, listen up.
If your bill came out late last evening, it may not be on the blue sheet or the yellow sheet.
So if it's not, you need to come back in the morning and ask for it.
So anything that you ask for today, it needs to be on either the blue sheet or the yellow sheet or see us in the morning, okay?
I thought that might cut down the line, so I'm not believe we do.
Okay.
Okay, let's go ahead and get started.
Go ahead, I couldn't see who's over there.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the committee.
I bring to you for your consideration House Bill 185.
You'll find it is the fifth bill down on the second page.
And you will likely recall that I have presented this bill
before this committee about three weeks ago.
It was recommitted to regulated industries
to fix a couple of mistakes to one, a technical error.
There was some outdated language as relates to fingerprints.
The fingerprint requirement for the licensing.
The language used in the bill originally was not current.
So that has been corrected on lines 363, the 369.
And then the second change was made,
the small change made at the request of the Department
of Public Health, they asked for a carve out.
Just to backtrack real quickly, if I may,
just a reminder, this bill modernizes and streamlines
the licensing requirements for dieticians and nutritionists.
the language is 30 years old and in dire need of updating.
So the Carvout is for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC.
The Department of Public Health asked for that Carvout
and we were happy to oblige.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, that is the Bill in a nutshell.
And I ask the committee for your favorable consideration.
I'll yield for any questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you Chairman and ladies and gentlemen my bill is 671 that's going to be the first
bill on page 7 and the LC number on that is 5 0 0 9 8 2 this bill was brought in last
session by representative Tim Fleming with floor leader McDonald and presented but it timed out
we didn't make it to the floor in time so here I am. So what this bill does is it protects children from
sexually explicit or lose performances at venues across the state. It does not restrict the
the venues from occurring but it provides that to attend these performances you must be of or over
age 18. Minors cannot be admitted even if accompanied by a parent or guardian. The bill outlines
fines for venues that violate these requirements in lines 41 to 52. The Department of Health
may impose a 50,000 fine for the first time and 100,000 for each subsequent fine. On
And Lon's 53-59 says that the venues are not liable if a minor comes with what is we would
refer to as a fake ID that they are not liable under that principle.
Also the Department of Revenue may suspend or evoke license if alcohol is sold at these
venues with a minor in attendance.
Again, this bill is not restrict venue performances, it's intended strictly to protect and restrict
attendance of minors from events containing sexual
explicit performances as outlined in code 1612-100.
Okay, I got a question for you with partners.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the author of the bill, you know,
while I certainly appreciate the intent
and I think everyone wants to make sure
that children are protected,
there has been some concern raised that, you know,
given that OCGA 1612-102 subsection five,
the definition of sexual conduct includes homosexuality,
that this bill could criminalize a same-sex couple holding hands in a public venue.
Is that your intent?
Thank you for the question, and now that's not the intent at all.
In fact, there's no discrimination in this bill whatsoever.
The venues can still take place, but ours outlawed in 16, 12, 100 sexually explicit is specifically
about genitalia either being touched or exposed.
Would the author be open to further amendment to ensure that there is no doubt
discriminatory effects that may result from this legislation.
With all due respect, there's no discrimination listed on the bill and this is strictly
about protecting the children.
Again, as a nurse current state law, the definition of sexual conduct includes homosexuality.
I think there are some attorneys that are concerned that again, this may lead to discrimination
against one of our vulnerable minority communities here in the state.
I hope you'll be open to continuing to work
and perfect this legislation.
Certainly, I'll be open to doing so with you.
Okay, thank you for your input.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm going to suggest y'all have a conversation
and answer some of those questions offline, if you don't mind.
Okay, you pass.
Okay, good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My bill is on the blue sheet page 5 HB 512 which is
about the seventh bill down. HB 512 addresses the challenges that homeowners face when they are
governed by an association. Specifically it caps them out that the association can charge homeowners
for a closing letter and second it provides for alternate dispute resolutions before a lien can
Let me place on the property.
That's the bill in a nutshell.
Okay, you don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Chair and Committee.
Thank you for hearing my bill this morning.
I am on page six in the blue sheet halfway down HB626.
I'm working off a substitute LC570261S.
This bill modifies the way we treat, we keep sexual assault kits in the state.
It takes out five strikes, five words from the code, no less than 20 years, and
replaces it with 30 years.
That's it.
Okay, no saying questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Jones, good to meet you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I'm working from the Blue Sheep page 7, the 6th bill down,
HB 718, LC number 590125.
This bill is providing that the first week in April
is dedicated as Women's Golf Week in Georgia,
the first week in April.
Thank you for your favorable consideration.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
All right.
I'll see you in question.
Have any votes, please?
Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I am work, my bill is found on page six
as the last on the bottom.
It's House Bill 662, substitute LC46200S.
What this bill does is simply provides
that rural hospitals that's been classified
as a rural emergency hospital can participate
in the Georgia Heart Program.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am on HPE 566, the very last one on the fifth page five.
This bill will protect artists from A.I. generated replicas.
Currently our copyright law only protects original recordings by artists
but not computer generated or AI generated replicas.
We are seeing this more and more now
and so Georgia needs to get ahead
in order to protect our artists
and having their voice and visual likeness used
without permission.
This is about individual rights.
They wanted, they can get permission
so it's not a complete no right to use.
However, they need to get permission
in order to do so.
We are also having a registry set up
with the Secretary of State for those artists who have passed so that they can register
and make sure that they have those who want permission can go to the Secretary of State
and find information in order to get permission.
And any violators will be subject to civil penalties and it will just follow our current
civil statute.
Okay.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I have a question.
I'm sorry.
Governor Spell. Thank you. Okay. No other questions. Thank you.
There's a silcon. Jim Silcon. Mr. Chairman, my bill is not on the sheet, but I'm
happy to come back tomorrow if you'd rather me just come in. It's not on the yellow or the blue sheet.
Okay. We'll see you in the morning. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Good morning. On page six, halfway down under modified rule, you will see HB 620 LC 570244.
It is blood plasma donation awareness day on February 17th. It comes out of the special
rules committee. Blood plasma is critical treatment for immunodeficiency conditions.
female liver conditions like sickle cell, pregnant women and babies in utero, which
genetic conditions shock trauma emergencies and burns just a few. If you go to the American
Red Cross homepage, you'll see their call for donations today due to an emergency shortage.
Of course, the whereas clauses won't be in the code, but it gives important facts in
history on the importance of blood plasma donations. If there are any questions, Mr. Chair,
I ask for the committee's favor of consideration.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you to the chair.
Thank you to the committee.
I present to you House Bill 138.
Little explanation.
Last summer myself and members of this body
is actually going to be on the first page.
Last summer, myself, members of this body
to include chairman Hitchens, chairman Crow,
repcomings and a few others went to law enforcement
training together and experience
where we call scenario-based training with law enforcement.
We were able to see the training at work
and how it makes officers more proficient
and reduces the liability for agencies
across the state by constantly training with hands-on training.
The benefits.
This reduces workmen's comp, reduces claims in general,
reduces the litigation, and it's less light
and it ensures that officers are less likely
to use excessive force and be more confident
when in the field by putting them in real life environments
in their yearly training.
This is funded through the State Training Center.
Codifying this ad will save local law entities money
because they can get this training
with the State Mobile Unit that goes out and teaches us
with the mobile team and it doesn't cost
their local government one additional penny.
All this bill does is ask a single line
de-escalation techniques and methods
to include scenario-based training.
This bill is supported by the Executive Director of Post and Executive Director of the Training Center as well and with that I stand for any questions.
I don't see any questions. Thank you.
I'm so glad I owe you an apology. I think you billed is on the list. Would you please present that to us at this time?
Certainly. That's why I'm a stake. I didn't see it.
We're looking at bill House Bill 664 and it is all the way.
This bill was brought to me by the Hancliffe Humber's Association in St.
East Brings.
They are a really old subdivision.
They were created in 1966 by Tom Cousins and they do not have a provision in their
covenants and restrictions to amend their covenants so they would like to bring this
bill to allow them to, with 80% of their landowners in that subdivision, with their vote
a super majority to be able to amend their covenants, and that is the bill.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members committee, House Resolution 392, Yellowsheet, 7th page
4th from the top, yellow sheet, 7th page, 4th from the top, house resolution 392.
What we're doing with the house resolution 392, we're creating a joint study committee
on the state board of registration of used motor vehicle dealers and used motor vehicle
parts dealers, right, currently they reside in the Secretary of State's office.
What this study committee is needed is to determine whether the regulation of the use motor vehicle industry would be best suited within the same agency that is responsible for issuing license plates that are essential for the operation of such businesses, which would be the Department of Revenue.
Okay. Thanks, sir. I'll see you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Chairman.
Two bills the first bill is House bill 168 on page eight number three
House bill 168 LC number fifty zero nine seven eight is a bill to add an over-step
Oversight step for the local delegation to re-approved the special purpose local auction sales tax and that's the bill in summation
Okay, don't see any questions second bill is house bill
On page number three, House Bill 342, LC number 550582S.
It is a substitute.
It repeals advertising restrictions on low THC oil licensing.
Right now they have a full restriction of the not being able to advertise.
This allows the commission to set guidelines to allow the six companies that have heavy regulations
to be able to advertise to their constituents.
Okay, you have a question that will park that you yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Going back to House Bill 168
Isn't it true that counties already have an extensive process for living at S-plus tax?
Could you help me explain why it's necessary for the state to now get in between the county and voters?
Absolutely. It allows an additional step for the local delegation to have communication with the county and with your
with the local delegation to make sure that that additional penny that is being added onto the tax code is in line with where the counting wants to go.
Is that an additional layer of government bureaucracy?
No sir, it's just an additional oversized step.
Thank you.
Okay, no other questions. Thank you.
Thank you.
Chair and Board.
A good morning, Chairman and members of the committee bringing you House Bill 632.
This is on page 6, a little past the midpoint down, page 6, House Bill 632.
This bill comes at the request of our Department of Veteran Services.
It clarifies the language regarding the exemption of occupational taxes and business license
fees for our disabled veterans.
It also updates the periods of war and armed conflict.
The end result of this legislation is that more of our disabled veterans that qualify
this benefit will be receiving it.
Okay.
No questions.
Thank you, sir.
Chairman?
We dour.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Bringing two bills to you today, both on page six.
These are two additional bills that have come out of the Blue Ribbon Committee looking
at licensure over the summer.
The first one, HB630, deals with the used cars, state board registration, and
House Bill 635, state licensing board, the residential, commercial, general
contractors, both the streamline, and let's cover some licensure process.
Okay, no questions, thanks sir.
I'm off to hearing this.
All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members on page 5, obviously we're about 5 down here.
have House Bill 504, House Bill 504 is allows Georgia residents to purchase a vehicle
value protection plan, works much like gap insurance and set forward coverage of value
of the vehicle and not the loan balance. Will that Mr. Chairman stand for question?
You got a question, Cory. Chairman Martin has a question.
Representative, we talked about this in subcommittee and my question is I was not
I have multiple meetings to get back to the committee.
It was mentioned, do we ever see a contract,
what this looks like?
Because as I understand in some community,
this money could never be paid to the individual
but paid for the policy.
It had to go to a dealer and they bought another car.
I'm just curious, do we ever see what a sample contract
look like to make sure we weren't setting Georgia's up
for a bad deal that was sold to them at a car dealer
that would benefit the car dealer and the dealer
or get paid for selling it?
Yeah, and thank you for your question, Mr. Chairman.
I know you missed full committee,
and I'll say this, in this bill 504,
it outlines what I can and cannot do.
This is another option for folks that they want to buy.
It cannot be part of the sale,
and I can't require them to purchase it
as a uncompensuous sale, anything like that.
So I do understand your issue and you raise those
and so committee.
So the question was, did we ever see what an agreement looked like?
Did we ever see a sample agreement?
What happened to bring you to the Amazon sample contract?
Right, that's like you actually.
OK, thank you.
I'll see you in the other question.
Thanks, sir.
Thanks, sir.
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm bringing to you House Bill 676.
It's a second down on page 7.
House Bill 676 is a frivolous mechanics lean bill. Currently the code is very
specific on what is required in order for an entity to file a mechanical
lean on a project. We are running into instances now where individuals are
filing frivolous leans and there's no penalty. I've heard stories now where they're
communicating with lawyers explaining to them that there's no right to have no
rights to do this at which point they've said that's true but we'll make your
life miserable and you'll be surprised how many people will give them. This will help
small businesses and owners and I believe a small piece to adding towards
shorter form but that I will stand for questions. You don't see any questions?
Thank you very much. You're clear. Thanks, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, come on up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got House Bill 493. It's going to be on the yellow
sheet fourth page about fifth from the bottom. House Bill 493 will
designate the Piney Woods cattle as the Georgia heritage cattle breed. This
cattle breed has history dating back to the state. Since the 1500s used by
many Native American tribes, a key part of the American Revolution and the
Civil War. Not aware of any other cattle breed that would like to get this
heritage designation and it's got the full support of the cattle with
association, so ask for your favor.
OK, we've got a question with the Williams at you.
Thanks, Chairman, to the author of the bill.
Thank you for the bill.
A friend of mine owned several of them.
They can absolutely live off of anything.
You had gotten even dropped here in front of them.
They'll eat in 1959, Cadillac.
Yeah, sir, you were great.
They're very native to the southeast.
Thank you.
I've seen the other questions.
Chairman DeLokes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the committee, House Bill 532
is the next to last bill on the very last page.
That would be page eight.
What this bill does is allow DNR to use grant money
to pay counties for work searches, road maintenance
that they do on state property.
Okay, I don't see any questions, thank you sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, committee.
I bring a bottom of page seven.
I'm page five, excuse me, page five.
I have HB555.
This bill passed out due to judiciary in 15-1.
This bill is given George's chance again to the American dream of owning a house.
It limits someone from owning more than 2,000 houses and gives the Wall Street owners four
years to sell down to that point.
This will address the supply of the housing crisis in Georgia.
I'll stand for any questions.
Do you have a question for you, Richard?
Do you hear me?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
How did you arrive at the 2,000 number?
I just, no really scientific method, I just thought 2000 would be a number that wouldn't
hurt Georgians.
I don't want to hurt private, you know, private Georgians.
It's just really going after the outside Wall Street investors.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Don't see any other questions.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
There's two camera.
More Mr. Chairman, I have HP 466, LC 620080, middle of the fourth page.
This bill would name the Marsh Tacky Horse, the heritage horse of Georgia.
They were once plentiful, used in Civil War, Revolutionary War by Native Americans, but
their numbers because of disease is dwindled and the recognition by the livestock
concerns in other groups that we need to start taking action now.
is the first step in recognizing that we need to preserve this animal.
There are smaller horses.
I can get one one without a staff platter, but they're good horses and we need to preserve
this braid.
So that's the bill.
Okay.
Thanks, sir.
I don't see any questions.
All right.
Okay.
Jim Gellie.
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.
I bring to you House Bill 447.
It's a page four just above the halfway mark.
And what this bill does, it gives prosecutors a tool to crack down on gift card theft by these international
Internationally sophisticated criminal enterprises, and I'm happy to answer any questions
No questions. Thank you. Thank you
Thank you, Mr. Chairman members of the committee
Just I just want to give
speak right into that mind. Okay, there we go. Y'all can't hear me. Yeah, good morning. All right,
this is better. My mic is low. Well, I just want to say some brief words before I get into
this house. Oh, house resolution 40, which is number two on the list. It's a study committee.
And I want you guys to understand how I came up with this resolution resolution for a study
committee. The storm that we had in our state, Helene, was very tragic and I
told my team it didn't affect my constituents but it affected Georgia's. And so
if you affect Georgia and you affect me and so I wanted something to be meaningful
and plenty for the state of Georgia so they came up with this study
committee for reinsurance and basically reinsurance is when the insurance
company transfers risk to another company and call it reassurance so most of
our insurance providers in here know what but know about reinsurance and that's
to bring the big big guys in to subsidize the insurance when you can't pay
that's the gist of the bill just study committee just try to bring all the big
guys here studying the gentleman from the 112 passed the bill on the floor on
yesterday and I think this study committee will really help his bill to
study what we need in our state. Okay, have a question, Chairman Smith. I just want
to thank you for looking into the needs of what I call ordinary citizens and
rough times. Thanks for your idea. Thank you, Madam Chair. Okay, no other questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, House Bill 645 is on the bottom third of page 6, and this is a very simple
one-page bill.
Section 1 is the meat of it, and it's literally one sentence, and I promised Chairman Cooper
that I would keep this simple, and that's what I've done.
what this does is repeal the requirement for long-term care facilities to test new residents for
COVID and new hires for COVID when they're coming in. This is put into place in the height of
the pandemic when a lot much broad scale transformation was going on in that industry and this is just
a return to normalcy and the department's good with it and it's something they're not enforcing
and now anyway, and most providers are not doing.
And so it's just, like I said, a simple return to normalcy.
OK, you got a couple of questions for you.
Mr. Miller, is it you?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the author over here, hi, to the author.
So you would agree that the elderly
are some of the most susceptible of our constituents
to COVID and other viruses.
Absolutely, Am.
And just to put this in contact,
when this was put into place,
the requirement to test all new move-ins for COVID
and new hires, they were visitor restrictions at that time too.
Now the visitors traffic has returned to normal.
These are residences of these people living
in these settings.
They're coming and going.
There's three shifts a day of caregivers
that are going back home.
So a test is just a point in time
that gives you some data at that point in time.
It does nothing to quantify the ongoing risk of this virus.
And so there's still safeguards in place.
Physician Sano, an exam before anyone moves in,
or anyone begins work.
There's infection control policies.
All of the right safeguards are in place.
This is just a simple return to normalcy.
We're part. Are there do staff or incoming residents are they tested for anything else they are. There's a there's a physician's evaluation report that's done and part of that is a tuberculosis test that's been in place for decades.
And then you know the position signs off one of the things that physician signs off on is that the person is free of communicable diseases.
Is it not true that COVID is essentially endemic now in which, you know, Americans today
are still dying from this in which I don't understand why we're selecting one, especially
when there is an ongoing process in which other diseases are being tested for.
Again, I think to protect our seniors, I don't know why we're having this sort of selective
politically-driven motivation of removing this requirement.
Could you better help me explain?
Well, understand, if you're making a political driven,
that's your choice.
It's not mine.
This is not a political issue.
It's just a simple return to normalcy.
And to sow that, the staff and managers of these settings
can focus on what's important.
A lot of times when people are moving in,
they're in a crisis situation.
And so just even a simple 15, 20, 30 minute test
is a distraction from other things that are more important.
and if they're symptomatic, of course,
the physician will catch that
on the physician's evaluation report,
and that'll be handled that way.
Okay, Karen Martin, just real briefly,
this doesn't prevent them from doing the test,
this just, they're running the business.
They just, they're set forth, isn't it true,
to care for the people in their facility,
and they're gonna do, they've done that for years,
prior to 2020, through the best of their ability,
this allows them that purview, does it not?
Exactly right, thank you for that.
And yeah, this is just a matter of,
you know, the legislature is not in the business
of running daily operations of these settings.
The department has a good handle on it
and they're neutral on this because they,
there's the overline qualifier of the quality
and infection control and position evaluation
and all the other safeguards in place.
This was just something that was done.
It was a late ad to Chairman Cooper's
House bill 987 in 2020, when the pandemic was raging,
if his illustrations were in place.
Okay, Pro Tem has a question.
This was put in place also before we had a vaccine.
Yeah, well, it's all right.
Yes, man.
To be honest, I didn't recall that we actually put it in law.
I thought it was as a result of emergency powers,
but we put it in law.
But we don't have it in law that one, for example,
must be screened for a flip.
For flip, is that right?
Absolutely.
And is it not also true that many more people in 20, 24, and 25 are dying from flu than
they are from COVID, so I mean, it would be consistent with other communicable diseases
that we don't put it in law, we lead that up to best practices.
Up to best practices, absolutely, and yeah, it's very simple, I know it gets complicated
in these settings because of just when you say COVID it just brings out all kind of other
thoughts and ideas but it's very simple and it's really a non-issue because the department
is not even enforcing it and provider aren't doing it.
This is just a cleanup so that we're allowing providers and the department to focus on
the priorities that matter most.
Okay, we've got a couple more questions if you will, let's be brief, share that a couple.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, one of the factors is that the nursing homes across our state
and across our country are extremely limited on the number of people applying for jobs
and their short staffed, and a lot of people that are applying for jobs to take care of
the patients don't want to be forced to take the COVID tests and want to have the choice
that we all have now.
So this should help them with getting people to work in the centers.
Good discussion.
Thank you, Chairman Cooper.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to have three real quick. Top of page two. House Bill 159.
This would increase the outstanding bond limit of mortgage revenue bonds that the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority can issue from $3 billion to $6 billion to fund their mortgage origination programs and Georgia Dream Program that they run through DCA.
D.C.A.
No seeing question, what's your next one?
161 right below that one.
George Bureau of Investigation concurrently, the Director concurrently issue administrative
subpoenas for very limited production of communication and subscriber information.
This would add a couple of other crimes to that to include swatting and domestic terrorism.
Okay.
No questions on that.
All right, and then lastly, on page seven, about the third of the way down House Bill 691,
it would create the Georgia Resilience Office and the Georgia Resilience Officer position
within the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.
It would be administratively attached to them.
This was a result of the study committee we did over the offseason on disaster mitigation
and resilience.
Do you have a question, Kim Smith?
Thank you.
I just want to commend you for this bill and also, we learned so much.
on the study committee and I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
George and Noah always needs to be a one act react we need to be prepared much better
than we are now.
You do a good job of cleaning up the mess, you don't do a good job of preventing it the
next time.
So thank you for that.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
No more questions.
Thank you very much.
Jeremy Smith.
Thank you, chairman Paris.
Members of the committee.
This morning I bring to you House Bill 535, that should be the sixth from the bottom
of page five. This bill is in response to the Calum case decision that came out
of court of bills. It's caused a little bit of a confusion and inconsistency and
how we calculate time served in almost all contexts. If a person is sitting in
jail waiting a judication of a case in Georgia, the law dictates their time
sitting in jail counts as time served if their sentence to more jail or present
time. This bill provides a very simple fix to the Calum case and counts time served
for probation or medication cases in the same way as any other case.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Tim Syms.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of committee, House Bill 430, which is third from the top
on page four, does two things, section one, makes clear that if you are put on the sex
offense registry in another state by moving to Georgia, that other state's decision automatically
carries over. And then section two clarifies that a sheriff of a given county if a judge
waves the a restricted address that sheriff has to be notified and has the ability to take
that issue to spear record if they find fit has to bill. Okay, no questions. Thanks, sir.
Thank you Chairman House Bill 237 page 2 halfway down it's a bill that would
it protect creatives in our state that through music film or dance that
there were not be used against them in court unless in a pre-trial they can
show that it meets certain qualifications. The second bill is on page. Oh, sorry. Page
7 House Bill 689. It establishes the Homelessness Prevention Program under DCA. Obviously,
it wouldn't be until appropriated, but it creates a line item opportunity for our state
to invest in Homelessness Prevention. We saw a lot of this during with ARPA money and
I think the ARPA money is about to run out, so there's a conversation to be had if it's
good for the state to keep people in their homes.
And then finally page 8, 328 is the SSOQEE Scholarship Program for the State of Georgia.
It increases the cap from $1,240 million, and it changes some other things in there as
well.
Okay, no questions.
Thank you, Sarah.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chair and members of the committee. House Bill 627 halfway down on page 6. So straight forward, clean up the juvenile justice code, providing consistency between class A and class B designated felony definitions.
Past unanimous the other house last year couldn't get to the Senate you got a question for you
Yes, I heard some concerns regarding this bill
You know it isn't this true that this bill add to the sacraments where a child can be prosecuted as an as an adult and that child will then be a
Fellin for the rest of their life
There's this is substitute
Yeah, that that whole section got stricken out. This is just the original bill from last year the passing and it's the other house
All we're doing is striking if you look online 12 and 13 striking provided that such daily weapon is not a firearm
It's all all this bill does
Okay, no more questions. Thank you. Thank you
Thank mr. Chairman members of the committee. I'm here to present to you house bill 376 which is on the last page of the blue sheet
This increases the cap on Georgia's historic rehabilitation tax credit from 30 to 50 million.
This bill passed the house last year 162 to 5 and got held up on the Senate.
And I just want to thank Chairman Blackman and Chair Williamson on their help on this bill.
Okay, no questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I believe I've already presented 370, 295, and 246, but on page 2, House Bill 288.
This is a bill that will provide some new process for law enforcement if they're put on
what's called a Brady or Giglio list for a prosecutor can basically single-handedly
put a law enforcement officer on one of these lists that could single-handedly ruin
a law enforcement officer's career and so we've worked with PAC and about every group
interested in this issue. I think we've got a good bill that provides due process for
law enforcement that would go through the post and provide a much needed due process
for our officers. Okay, have a question for you.
Mr. Evans, that year. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the author, two questions. One was
wondering what what brought this about what situation who was harmed why we're
here and then secondly does any other state provide this extra level of
protection for law enforcement? Sure so there have been multiple examples across
the state of officers being put on these lists in fact that since I've
introduced this bill I've actually gotten calls from spouses and officers saying
how this is similarly when their career they haven't been able to get another
job because they've been put on these lists and again there's no way to get
there's no way to prove that they were didn't do something wrong and so there
are multiple examples here in Georgia there have been a handful of states that
passed similar legislation which states just off top my head I know Iowa and
North Carolina just in recent years there's several others though you could
let us know about that I appreciate it and then why no concerns for any other
people that might be put on this list whose reputation could be hung or why are
we stingling out say that again sorry why the list is I understand I don't
in the process criminal law, but the list says that there's some reason to doubt the credibility
of the witnesses. Am I understanding that right?
That's right.
Anybody who gets on this list, I would imagine, is not happy about it.
Only law enforcement can be put on the list.
Only law enforcement.
That's right.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Miller, you have a question.
Do.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
the author, the federal system has a list of officers or maintains a list of officers whose
credibility has been questioned and they have a policy of not using those officers under
certain circumstances. Is that correct? I believe that is correct, yes.
And is the motivation for that? To your understanding that prosecutors want to encourage law enforcement
officers who are special class of witnesses in criminal cases to be honest to
not lie under oath to not withhold exculpatory evidence and to not do things
that would otherwise jeopardize a valid prosecution.
Absolutely that's the point of these lists. I think it's important that you have
this that the prosecutor maintains the ability to use this and it's actually a
Supreme Court ruling that ensures it, but I do think it's important, you know, as you
know, if an law enforcement officer is never using a criminal case and their work is going
to become irrelevant pretty quick and some officers at any arrest they make now are just
being thrown out because prosecutors can't call them to the witness stand.
So what's important here, this again takes it out of the court system, it moves it all
to post.
I think it's also important to note that this is an opportunity, whereas right now, if
officers put on a such a list. It's not reported to post. It's not review. This
one, sure, if an officer actually did do something wrong or if they've said
something that's untrue, it'll be investigated and it will stay in their
files. This will also help us ensure that if there's an officer's done
something wrong, that it will be taken off the streets. One more question, Mr.
Triman. Who will be doing the investigating other officers or officers of
the court post. Thank you. Okay, I have another question. Jim Hitchens. Isn't it true that
they're denied due process and arrangement is in place now and what you're doing would give them
due process to have an investigation and bring out the facts. Now they just go on the list and
that's the end of it. That's right. I mean right now a prosecutor can single-handedly put someone
on a list and there's no way to get off. All this does is give an opportunity for an officer to
to prove their case and again it will ensure investigation if they did something wrong and get them off the streets.
We appreciate it.
Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you for the bill. Isn't it true that North Carolina, Iowa and Minnesota have taken up similar due process bills for this exact issue?
And I think there may even be others, but certainly I know at least the first two and I'm sure Minnesota as well.
Thank you.
You you had mentioned you you've already discussed house bill 370 have you know I have yes, okay?
No, no other questions. Thank you. Thank you, mr
Okay, Prince
Well, I miss chairman members of the committee pays four of your blue sheet house bill 483
provides protection for
Code enforcement officers in the what they perform in their duty
Okay, we don't see any questions, thank you sir.
Thank you.
Big simply a shocker.
Thank you chairman and members of the committee.
Blue sheet, page two, house bill 259.
It's a bipartisan effort here to desidate and recognize on the second
each August as local elected officials day here in Georgia.
Because I know we have a lot of local elected officials,
former local elected officials here.
And you know how it is to serve.
And sometimes it's almost like a thankless job,
but we want to show our appreciation for them.
OK.
What do you have a question, I'm sure?
James Smith.
I do have one question, would you consider adding site
elected local officials today?
What do you consider adding state elected officials to that?
Well, you know how it is when we're doing things for ourselves.
They don't really like that.
So we were able to just do the local and for the record,
I do have my town, just for the record, my ties on, okay.
Okay, don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
That's you, Campbell.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a COVID-19 Department. I didn't know I was going to be doing this right now, so I'm borrowing a coat, so thank you.
I'm presenting HB618 and LC number 520793.
This bill is about requiring any seller of real property to make certain disclosures
regarding flood damage to buyers.
The way it is now, a renter,
if you own a home and you're renting it,
you have to disclose flood damage to a renter.
But you don't have to disclose it to a buyer.
This bill, this is the whole bill,
it's one thing that it puts a buyer
on the same level as a renter.
So that's what it is, and I appreciate any consideration.
Thank you.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, members of the committee have a request.
Representative Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On the yellow sheet, two compensation resolutions,
HR 118 and 119, these are resolutions
that passed out last year and got sold over in the Senate
and hoping we can get them across the finish line this year.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, but I'd like to ask for a House Bill 490 on behalf of Representative
Bayes Moore.
And this bill deals with crimes and efficiencies as it relates to training programs relative
to human trafficking for hotels, and we know that human trafficking has been a big focus
here in Georgia, and we'd like to ask for that on her behalf.
Okay.
don't see any questions. Thank you. Chairman Hawkins, is that you?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the type of page six, HB571 licensing of radiologist assistance
to increase access and then lower down on their page HB629 remove requirements for
license positions with the AED.
Okay.
No, do we have a question?
Chairman Blackman has a question for you.
Yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate the conversation with Chairman Hawkins this far.
But on 5.71, are we talking about the establishment of a new license here?
I'd just direct your attention to sections 3.34, 3.35 and 3.36.
It is, it's an upper level of radiology assistance.
I just, I'm not a change to what we have now.
I noticed that it mentions established adopt exam
and a new advisory board.
So, under the purview of the board.
So, thank you for the answers.
Thank you.
Okay, any other questions there?
No, say more questions.
Thank you.
Jim Jasper's.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Committee.
Like on page eight, House Bill 248,
the DO Thermal Tax Credit.
It has a cap and a sunset.
It'd be very helpful.
Thank you.
Okay, you don't see any questions on that.
Could I dim see, is that you?
Yes.
My apologies, I have a few measures
that have just gotten ripe and ready for the asking.
Okay.
The first is HB533, the wrongful Conviction Compensation Act that we've worked on for years.
Whereas the Hocom has worked on this and it's been a joy and an honor to work to try to
take this out of our legislative hands.
Along with that, that is on the blue sheet, I'm sorry, page 5, 7 from the bottom, 533.
On the yellow sheet, going along with this, would be page 6 at the bottom, two resolutions,
are 128 and 129 which are compensation resolutions. The house passed them out last year and they did not get
heard in the Senate. The next is on page 7 on the blue sheet, third from the top HB677, to help with
the placement upon discharge of children from our hospitals and psychiatric residential treatment centers.
Then also on the yellow I believe I asked yesterday, but just to make sure on page 5, 10th from the top
HB 567
Teledenistry to allow Georgia Dennis to and hygienist to practice outside of the office
Okay, I've seen questions
Here we go. Here's a give you a quiz
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
On page five of the yellow sheet near the bottom house bill 582
this is a Georgia Survivor Justice Act. What this deals with is individuals that
have been coerced or forced into committing crimes. This includes not
malice murder but the various types of murders all the way down to minor crimes.
If they're doing time on it that sets out the criteria on how long they will
serve if it's a life sentence it will reduce it to 10 to 30. As I told the
committee this is not a get out of free jail bill but this is to try and help
these people get their life started up again. Okay, don't see any questions on
there. New registration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Being distributed right now is
a substitute to House Bill 579. While that's going out I will tell you all about
about it, the, there was a study committee chair about,
could chair about Chairman Hatchett,
looking into licensing reform,
Representative Matt Reeves has done an outstanding job
working on that.
He previously presented the preparations committee
substitute to that bill.
What we've done is in the interim taken input
from folks who are concerned about how interstate
compacts insurance coverage and others may be impacted,
or Georgia professionals may be impacted
by this legislation.
So the substitute that's coming out to you now
simply removes what was part two,
which dealt with registration of auctioneers,
geologists, and hearing aid dispensers.
That's no longer in the bill.
What's remained is section one,
dealing with what I consider expediting
and improving the process for applications for licensure
and renewals of licensure is really getting
at the heart of the issue.
I think there's going to be continued effort to work on this in the future and I'd ask for the committee's favorable consideration of the rules committee substitute.
Okay.
I have a question for you.
Yes sir.
Representative Avige.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the leader of the station.
I think I heard you right.
I've gotten calls from auctioneers.
They're completely out of this.
That's correct.
Thank you.
Okay. Any other questions? Okay. We're going to entertain a motion to do pass on rule
substitute LC550580S. Have a motion in a second. Is there any opposition? No, see any
in the observation that the S was okay.
Who else, you have them?
Yes, this is House Bill 433, it's on your blue sheet, four down, on your blue sheet,
on page 4. This just allows, right now there's a gap in the GCIC information that the Department
of Human Services and therefore the Division of Family and Children Services is authorized
to access per Georgia code. This would just allow them the breadth of the information that's
available on the Georgia Crime Information Center. I'll be happy to stand for any questions.
Okay, you don't see any questions.
Okay, here we are.
No, no.
Chairman Powell, do you want to present 467?
much surprise surprise. This is a Monument Protection Act. This clarifies some language
that has never been clarified about who has standing on this Monument movement when
there's petitions to move. The most important part of this is that it gives the local governments
an option, a 90-day option, and that option would be if they wish to move a
monument. They can run it, they're legal, the legal organ of that city are
accounting, and they can advertise that they want that this monument is to be
moved and they're offering it up to interested parties. This gives them an option
if there's lawsuits that are filed in that after the court, after the court is
deal with the matter then they can still come back and offer it up again. The decision
would be up to the local governments to do this. They could pick whoever they think would
be the appropriate, the appropriate group to move this monument. It tries to get some
of this out of litigation and some of the bitterness that surround some of these issues
in this day and time.
Okay. I don't see any questions. Thanks, sir. Okay. We've got approximately 150
bills on our blue sheet, so forth. Obviously we're not going to get to all of those, but what we'll do now is
set a rules calendar for March the 6th, cross-over day. So we'll do that now. Under modified structure, house bill 150.
