Have all members voted? . Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doerkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. . Good morning. I got up this morning and the meteorologist said it was going to be sun shiny today and then I walked out and it made me wet. I don't know about y'all but I guess they get it wrong sometimes. That's a great day anyway. We are going to begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chapel and after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. This morning will be introduced by the lady from the 13th House District Chairman Katie Dipsy. Chairman Dipsy. . Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, friends. It's good to see all of you here this day. Rainy, sun shiny, whatever it is. We are all blessed to be here. There is no doubt. I am very grateful to the clerk for the first time I think because of so much that we are all dealing with in this unique time. I said thank you, God, for letting me be in your day. I felt it was not mine anymore. I think it is his and it is so special that we start our day this way. When I was first elected I didn't know it. So thank you and thank you for inviting father Austin Goggins to come and address us today. He is not my minister but he is a minister to many in my hometown. Austin is the first vicar and pastor of St. Andrews Anglican Church in Rome. With his wife Lee, they planted that church in 2010 and they live in Rome with their two teenage sons Thomas and Ethan who have both paged here for me in this house. He has been a long time resident of Floyd County, a 1995 graduate from pepperall high school and he received his undergraduate degree from our own shorter college and a graduate education degree from Jacksonville State University. He received his master's of arts and ministry from the Shoda House Theological Seminary which is an Anglican and Episcopal Seminary in Wisconsin but he came home thank goodness. Father Goggins is also blessed to be a teacher in my community with the Floyd County public school system for 22 years. Today he is a special education teacher serving emotional and behavior disorder students in the sixth and eighth grade in our Margie medal school where he has coached football, track, cross country and basketball. Please join me in welcoming father Austin Goggins. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be accessible and thy sight O Lord my strength and my Redeemer. Speaker Rossston representative Dempsey honorable members of this chamber grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a great honor to join you in our state's capital to share in your daily devotional time. Thank you speaker Rossston for the invitation to thank you represented Dempsey for facilitating the process this morning. In addition to serving as a parish priest I also teach public school as was mentioned. I currently teach self-contained students with emotional and behavior disorders in Floyd County. However I started out my career 20 years ago teaching Georgia history so you can imagine my head is swimming a bit at the great pleasure being here and in this building. Our text this morning comes to us from Paul's letter to the Galatian Christians. Chapter 6 verse 9. And let us not be weary and well doing. For in due season we shall reap if we faint not. In his letter to the Galatians Paul was doing what he often did. He was correcting and monitoring, chastising, teaching and encouraging. Paul is riding to new converse tucked away in the region of Asia Minor. There's was a world surrounded by false teachings both inside and outside the church. The young churches of this mountainous area were confronted with problems both within and without. And in this letter to them Paul runs the gamut. Paul has to defend and remind them of his own apostolic authority. He has to chase off those who had pollute the gospel of Christ by slaving them to the old law. He lays out the great doctrine of grace and the original purpose of the law. And then ends in chapter 6 with an admonition that they all look after each other. They all love each other and bear one another's burdens. And it is in this last chapter in verse 9 that we find a thought I want to bring to your remembrance. A caution if you will in our short time together. And that warning, a warning issued in love, is that you do not allow yourself to grow weary and well doing. But you may ask Pastor how can you grow weary and well doing? If what you have set your hand to is just right, noble and good, how can you ever grow tired or discouraged? I would submit to you this morning that if you ever had the unfortunate experience of seeing a student that you cherish, go from being sweet, polite and funny in one moment to being filled with rage, anger, and having to be physically restrained the next. And you know it's nothing that you did. It's nothing really even that the student did. But it is rather a sad convergence of horrible past physical abuse, parental neglect, or psychological issues beyond your expertise, that you know what it means to grow weary and well doing. If you have ever given yourself to a parish and loved a people with all your heart, celebrating their joys and highs in life, but also weeping and mourning with them, you know what it means to grow weary and well doing. And if light no doubt all of you, you have ever spent countless hours praying, thinking, and studying how you should handle the various issues of our state. And you have made a decision, voted or promoted a policy with the best of intentions, to only find out the half of the people you are trying to serve are unhappy. And many, instead of seeing it as a simple disagreement on policy, assigned to you the worst of motives, I'm sure you know what it means to grow weary and well doing. I want to say to you this morning that the work you do is important. And I want to encourage you to not grow weary and well doing. You don't have to be a priest to serve God. You don't have to work with special needs students or be a missionary in a far-al corner of the world to serve God. Martin Luther in the Middle Ages reminded us all that we can all have a vocation. For him that meant that the monks are nuns clustered in their cells, we're not automatically any closer to God than the peasant working in the field or the craftsman in his shop. We all have a part to play and when we take the work we find ourselves doing and submit that work in our efforts to the Lordship of Christ, we find ourselves in a vocation. So this morning to ward off growing weary, let us look to some phrases. And a few verses preceding the verse I read, it is there we find the key. It is there that Paul says things like this, be gentle with those who make mistakes. Bear one another's burdens, live life with humility, and let us do good to everyone. Stand with us and let us pray. Almighty God who has given us this good land for our heritage. We humbly besieged thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of thy favor and glad to do thy will. Bless our land with honorable industry, sound learning, and pure conduct. Save us from violence, discord, and confusion. From pride and arrogance and from every evil way. Defend our liberties in fashion into one united people, the multitudes brought hither out of many kindreds and tongues. In due the spirit of wisdom, those to whom in thy name we entrust the authority of government that there may be justice and peace at home. In that through obedience to thy law, we may show forth thy praise among the nations of the earth. In the time of prosperity, fill our hearts with thankfulness. And of the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in thee to fail, all of which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Join me with the pledge. A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the Republic of Richard Stands, one nation under God, indivisible, liberty, and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Chair recognizes the Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All purpose does the majority leader of the house rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Parliamentary inquiry. Let's speak is not true that house bill 162 has met all the criteria and posed for local legislation to be considered and approved by this body. By our committee on overgo, intergovernmental coordination chaired by chairman Tancersley has met all the local advertisements that are required and the delegation agreement and is it further not true in the speaker that the chairman of the committee, chairman Tancersley has heard no objection or any concerns about this local legislation and it should be passed as a courtesy to our local legislation. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true in knowing the chair of that committee. I can't say I would bet everything was done yet but I am confident that she has dotted all the eyes and cross the tees. What purpose does whip Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that we have received numerous emails from people in Morgan County who are concerned about the fact that a currently bipartisan board will be replaced with a board that is appointed by commissioners that do not have that same commitment so that that is why we are raising this concern in Morgan County. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true the chair is not received any emails at all. What purpose does the representative year to rise? He waves off. Okay. Have all members of what purpose does the majority caucus whip rise? Mr. Speaker, is it parliamentary inquiry? The state's your inquiry. Isn't it true that the legislation House Bill 162 clearly defines the board of election to be bipartisan as both political parties have an opportunity to appoint individuals of that board of election? I think that is the definition of bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. Isn't that true? If the gentleman so states I'm sure he believes it to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Last one. What purpose does Chairman Mitchell rise? Mr. Speaker, is it parliamentary inquiry? The state's your inquiry. Is it not true that this proposal will not assure that there will continue to be nonpartisan, oversight and accountability for the election process in Morgan County, which is the very definition of election boards? Well, we're about to find out what the will of the House is in that regard. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 69. The nays are 97. The motion has failed. If there is no objection, we will now vote on the local calendar as a whole with a recorded vote. Hearing none, it is so ordered. The clerk will read the local calendar. House Bill 162 by substitute by reps of built in the 112th Morgan County. House Bill 211 by reps of Williams, the 148th town of Arava. House Bill 225 by reps of prints of 127th city of rents. House Bill 242 by reps of Chocus, the 138th city of America. House Bill 251 by reps of Glatton and 75th Clayton County. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on the local calendar? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bills? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall these bills now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bills on the local calendar will vote aye. As opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bills on the local calendar. The eyes are 123. The nays are 41. These bills having received the requisite constitutional majority are therefore passed. We're going on now to morning orders. We're going on to morning orders. The chair is so excited about bills being on the rules calendar that we're going to limit morning orders to one minute each today. We have several lined up. Chair recognizes Chairman Petrie for a morning order. If you have a morning order, you can come on down front and conserve a little time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we'd rise with me to recognize the loss of a great Georgian. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Eleanor Sandy Tory West. Miss West died recently on January 17th at the age of 108. Miss West was a remarkable woman who did great things for the Georgia coast and particularly for the conservation of our coast. Back in 1978, Miss West and her family sold Osabala to the state of Georgia for half of its appraised value. And that land was forever established as a heritage preserve, our first heritage preserve in the state of Georgia, permanently protected and dedicated to cultural, scientific and natural research and education. This remarkable woman has done so much for this coast. My friends, if you have not been to Osabala Island, make a visit, most beautiful 26,000 acre island on our Georgia coast, a jewel of this coast, and it's ours. It belongs to the people of Georgia because of Sandy West. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to invite members one minute each. Chair recognizes representative Mack Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, the speaker. Today I rise for a black history moment for Washington County. Barry Popps Gordy was born July 10th, 1888 in San Diego, Georgia. He grew up working on the family farm with his brothers and sisters. For hard work, the Gordys were able to save enough to buy more land and a better home to live in. The Gordy children learned the principles of hard work and careful business practices very early in life. At the meeting a pretty local school teacher named Bertha Fuller, young Barry Gordy convinced her that she should marry him. At the pot was married, he moved his family to Detroit, Michigan. He taught himself to blast into carpentry until he became a contractor. He bought a grocery store which became a small institution within the east side of Detroit's black community. Popping his wife Bertha continued their job a reason of family of eight children with such quality that they would live to see that family can't claim as one of the most outstanding black families within the nation. His son, Barry Junior, was the founder and board chairman of Motown Records. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Will Wade for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and to my fellow colleagues. I rise today just to give you guys some good news and recognize a local hero back home. Today, a few weeks ago, you let me pass my first resolution and I appreciate Speaker Austin, who and I joined in representing Dawson County. We are now representing today, February 9, 2021 as Chase, Elliott Day, all across Georgia. So big shout out for number 9 and the date actually is kind of a special meaning for that family in our community because both father and son representing that at the second month and then the number 9 car. And I just also happen to represent the night district of Georgia. So it's a great, great day. I just want to remind folks that Chase, Elliott, started out racing as an eight year old boy. Things do not happen without a lot of hard work and a long, long term vision. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I yield well. Thanks. Chair recognizes representative Mayner for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker Austin. On behalf of District 56 and just my family, the caucus has decided that we're going to celebrate Black History Month and I couldn't decide who I wanted to do. And so I decided to do my grandfather. This is a picture of him. This man was born, his name is Julius Huttow Mayner. He was born in 1911 in Dooley County, Georgia, Byronville. Our family, our farmers in Dooley County to this day, the family has been researched all the way back to the 1820s. We on the same land that we've owned since the 1800s and we're still farming in that area to this day. Julius Huttow Mayner. Chair recognizes representative Frazier for a morning order. Representative Frazier going once, twice, three times. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good morning colleagues. Today I want to introduce you to Priscilla and Peyton. They are sweet well behaved girls who enjoy playing with their friends, getting along with others on the playground, watching cartoons, playing on their tablets, playing checkers, reading and watching funny movies. Priscilla and Peyton are one of far too many children available for adoption today in Georgia. These sweet beautiful girls are in need of a forever home. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The first bill of the 2021 session goes to the chair of the Higher Education Appropriate Association's Committee, Chairman David Knight. Chairman Knight. I forgot to have the clerk read the caption. I got so excited. This is a big moment. Mr. Clerk would you read the caption to House Bill 265? House Bill 265 has a knight of the 130th. Williamson 115th and others to be taught on act to men, taught on 48th. The fish go to Georgia. Senator relaying the revenue and taxation. So it's the revised terms in the internal revenue code and internal revenue code of 1986. This bill ever further the committee on ways and means that the committee recommends a disbilled do pass. Chairman England, you just spent money. I mean, no count. Chair recognizes Chairman Knight to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. What an honor and again, what a stimulating topic for a first bill, the income tax code. So I'll be brief. Members, this is our annual internal revenue code update. As you know, the internal revenue code passes, laws at the thorough level. Our state actually starts with, if you will, the state rules and then we'll either add or subtract from that in our code. This is that annual update real briefly. It provides for several changes to which are increasing the deductibility of medical expenses, charitable contributions. Also just the low income housing tax rate and the ceiling. One of the important measures I think is all important to us in Georgia, especially dealing with our restaurants.

50% reduction on meals. This also piggybacks off the state, I mean off the Feds, in which we're now allowing for next two years 100% to deductibility on meals. We want to make sure that our restaurants survive COVID, this COVID pandemic that we have, we know they're having a lot of issues. Other thing is, we've got a provision here that excludes gross income from the discharge of qualified principal reduction in debt, in this in other words, if you go in a bank, rushy and you lose your home, you don't have to add that back for goodness of debt. We've got a provision here that I think is great for Georgians and employees. Certain employee payments on student loans, allowing the employers to actually pay up to around $5,250 without having to include that income on the employees W2, so great policy there. And then most of all, it's clarification on regarding the CARES Act and a lot of these PPP loans that you hear about. We're now making sure that we're clarifying. The loans, the forgivability of those loans is non-taxable at the state level and the deductibility of the expenses associated with the loans are deductible. In other words, there will be no tax effect on the folks that use those. So that is good news. It's good news to make sure that we're taking care of our businesses and our citizens in this time of crisis. And I would ask that you support the IRC update and that we quickly get over to the Senate so that we can get it out and we can get this pass so that all of the CPAs and tax repairs can get the software updates, which right now people are preparing tax returns. And it is time sensitive. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm gonna ask everybody's favourable consideration and I'll send for a question or two if needed. You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you all. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on House Bill 265? Chair here's none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill that Chair here's none? The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of House Bill 265? Well, vote aye, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. No county all opposed will vote today for no chancellor. Go ahead, please. questions of course, no caller. For the wish of the bill. Have all members voted If so. If all members now voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 265, the eyes are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 105. House Bill 105, I will represent the clerk of 147th and others to be titled Act 2-Amen, Part 3 of Article 3 of Chapter 2, Title 38, the Fish Bill to George Annotated relating to pay pensions and allowances of state military personnel, this bill ever referred to the committee on defense and veteran affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of the Defense and Veterans Affairs Committee. Chairman, he's clerk to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I have House Bill 105 before you today. This is a House keeping measure to update 38 to 250 because when House Bill, when Section 382.6.1 was added to our code, it was inadvertently passed, but didn't authorize it. It was passed, but didn't authorize payment for people who serve under that section. And what that section is is the governor can make a request for people to volunteer for active duty service. Lately, we've seen that happen over the last couple of years regarding cyber defense task force being called, asked for people to serve and being called to help when some of our state systems have been attacked. Just to make it clear, no guardsman has never not been paid. This just makes it clear and authorizes the Georgia guard to pay guardsman when they volunteer for service upon the governor's request. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker, and I'll stand for any questions. You do have a question. Do you care to yield? I will yield. Chair recognizes a minority leader of the House, leader Beverly to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman yield. I will yield. Just I just have a quick question on chapter two, article one, parts two and four, you distinguish between organized militia and unorganized militia. Could you just give us just a brief overview of what the difference is between the two? The organized militia, you're talking about the definition online three. The organized militia is the legal term when you include the guard and the governor's state defense force. It's not some paramilitary group, it's the official term for the Georgia National Guard and the state defense force combined. You have no further questions. All right, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on House Bill 105? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 105 will vote aye. As opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Are you wanting to be recognized representative Canter? What purpose? Is it not true that the Georgia National Guard used non-lethal force on citizens this year? I'm not sure what kind of force they used. I don't know that they were required really to use any. Have all members now voted? What purpose does representative Bonner rise? The chair here is none. The last several years during this pandemic and is providing safety security not only for these capital grounds but for areas all across our state. Well, the chair would agree. What purpose does chairman Chokus rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it also true that the National Guard in the state of Georgia pioneered the efforts to sanitize and protect our senior citizen facilities as well as hospitals and other community facilities during the pandemic? I believe that to be true. Have all members now voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 105. The eyes are 165. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 205. House Bill 205, I have heard of some of Williams of the 148th lump sum of the 12th and others to be entitled to mental 33. The fiscal to George Antedt and related insurance system provide a framework for regulating the offering or issuance of tribal insurance and the state this bill ever further committee on insurance that committee recommends a dis bill. Before I recognize you representative Williams, what title is the insurance code in our law? I want you to address that when you get into well, please. Would you? And then if there's any significance to that number, you might want to touch on that too. Chair recognizes representative Noel Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you members. I rise today in discussion of House Bill 205. This was a bill that the travel insurance we brought before the House. This is the third year we would bring it before the House. The previous two years it passed out of the House and then last year we had unforeseen COVID that kind of stopped everything in its tracks. I'm going to hit the few highlights this bill passed out of committee 100%. But it deals with travel insurance creating a more playing level playing field providing more uniform regulations. The bill is a more uniform regulation across the states. Specifically the bill clarifies sales practices and applies unfair trade practice laws. Creates the uniform product structure that improves efficiency and product cost savings. Also it imposes consumer disclosures in addition to standard states insurance laws allows for its sale using group or blanket policies. And this was model was assembled from the best features of travel insurance laws for many states and it added robust consumer protections. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Yes, ma'am. Did you address the questions I had? I will address it now. Why are you waiting? I was waiting for you to give back to the podium. There is a well known book that had 33 chapters. This is a very good read. Also, that's when I say, you're Jesus died at age 33. So there are many significant items with number 33. But those two come to mind. You got a few questions up here. Okay. I yield for questions. You get a little rusty from one session to the other in explaining bills. Yes, sir. That's obviously what's happened here. Chair recognizes the chair of the Game Fish and Parks Committee because it's a special day for him. For a question. Do you're right? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? I will. Does this insurance and will this insurance cover transcending time? If not, tell me why. Well, sir, as you know, insurance covers time when someone dies. But transcending time, I don't see how this applies to cover that at this time. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that your bill is just making sure that no cheating takes place in Title 33? And where else would this apply? Well, no cheating is a very good reference. It's on some door shops and above endkeepers. And no cheating also applies in this house and this all gets body. And also with insurance because if you cheat, you get hammered on it. That's my answer. Go to prison sometimes, too. Yes, sir, sometimes. You further yield one more. One more. Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In rules this morning, I gave you a preview of this question so you would have time to prepare for it. I understand that this insurance bill also deals with travel across the oceans through the waters. Is that correct? You're correct. Please relate the importance of that idea to the theory of the grand circulation of waters. Well, I can only say with the grand circulation of water, water is constantly moving. Sort of like with travel insurance. If you're on a boat, hopefully you're constantly moving. In life, we're constantly moving. We're moving until we die. Kind of like with travel insurance. You're moving as long as you have it. I think we should get your point. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope you all vote for this bill and I yield the well. Gentlemen, has yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Chairman Hogan or Chairman Bershitt would one of y'all vote representative Williams's machine. I don't know how he wants to vote, but he's going to vote for the bill. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 205. The eyes are 164. The nays are four. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 174. House Bill 174, by the way, dower the 119th and others to be entitled to act to amend Code Section 401. 80, the official go to Georgia Antietta relating to safe operations and motor carriers, commercial motor vehicles, and drivers just bill them refer to the committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Weedow are to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, come today with House Bill 174. It is the annual bill for the Department of Public Safety to codify their rules and accordance with federal law, bring them up to date to 2021. I'll yield for any questions. You have no questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor? The passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 174, the eyes are 167, the nays are zero. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 112. House Bill 112 by Representative Kelly, the 16th Cooper, the 43rd Carpenter, the 4th and others to be entitled an act to amend the act relating the torts to provide certain communities from liability claims regarding COVID-19. This bill then referred to the special committee on access to the civil justice system. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the majority caucus whip. Representative Kelly to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I come before you today with House Bill 112, which is a bill that couldn't get any simpler, but couldn't be more important. All House Bill 112 does is change one number on one line in Georgia's code. It extends the sunset on the COVID liability protections that this house passed in June. But it's more important than that, Mr. Speaker, because we know our state continues to be ravaged by a pandemic. We know that our businesses continue to struggle to stay open. We know that our hospitals and our medical community continue to struggle to take care of the Georgians that are our constituents. At a time when they're being attacked by this horrible virus, what we don't need is for them to be attacked by frivolous lawsuits. And so what we're doing today is simply changing the sunset from July 14, 2021 to July 14, 2022, so that we can keep our economy open. So that we can keep our businesses growing, so that we can keep our citizens treated. We have a responsibility, Mr. Speaker, to make sure that there's facilities for our citizens to be treated in. We have a responsibility to Georgians who want to continue to operate their small businesses. And what we have an opportunity today is give them the certainty that for the next year they don't have to worry about frivolous lawsuits. I'll tell you what the bill doesn't do, Mr. Speaker. It doesn't change any of the current protections that a single employee in the state of Georgia enjoys through our workers' compensation system. When we pass the bill in June, there are some debate on what this would do to employees' rights. And that should be a short conversation because it's nothing. It literally said in the bill, this shall not impact Georgia's Workers' Compensation Act. So there is nothing, not a single right that will be taken away from a single employee in our state. What this will do, though, is allow businesses to stay open so that employees have an opportunity to go to work, so they continue to have a paycheck, so they continue to provide further families. This bill has the support of the medical community and the hospital association. It also supported by our business community, proud to have the Georgia Chamber, the Metro Chamber as well as the National Federation of Independence, business supporting this measure. Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to take a few questions. It feels like a few years ago since we're here in June, but I know the debate is still fresh on people's minds as it should be. This is important for our state, and I'll be glad to answer any questions. You got a few. Do you yield? Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield. I'll be glad to hear recognized as representative LeHood for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I will yield. Is it not true that I've heard from countless members of the business community across this state who are in favor of this bill? If the gentleman says states, I'm sure he's had the same conversations I have. Do you further yield? I will. Is it not true that without this bill that we passed back in June, a lot of the businesses that are open today providing very needed goods and services to the citizens of this state would not be open? You're absolutely correct. It would not be provided to the services that we're going to do. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. I'll yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Petrie to your left for a question. Does gentleman yield? I will yield. Is it not true that we are in unprecedented times for health care providers all across this state and that they are under siege? We are. Does gentleman further yield? I'll further yield. Is it not true that this measure will allow health care providers all across this state to continue to stay focused on protecting and serving the most vulnerable in our society at this most critical time without concern for frivolous loss. You're exactly right. That's what's taking place since June and with the passage of this we can ensure that it will take place through July 14th, 2022. Mr. Speaker, I know there's going to be some folks want to speak against this. Want to speak against helping our businesses stay open. Want to speak against protecting our hospitals. But Mr. Speaker right now I'm going to yield the well and we'll give it a listen. Gentlemen, as you did the well, we do have some members that have signed up. I think that the rules committee put a time limit of one hour of debate on each bill on today's calendar. That's chair having the authority to allocate that time. So the chair will allocate 30 minutes to those speaking in opposition to the bill. And they can carve that up the way they choose. Chair recognizes representative Wilson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I voted for this bill last year but I rise against House Bill 112. And I want to make sure I make myself as clear as humanly possible in my comments. Because of the massive damage this body stands to do, should we make the mistake of passing this measure today. But just to underline how serious I am, I call your attention to the fact that I went a whole term without making it down here to the well to speak against any bill. I don't take this lightly and I know the members of this chamber don't either. Dealing with COVID has been the top priority of every member in this chamber for almost a full year now. Anything we consider on COVID needs to be scrutinized with the strongest microscope available. And I'm sure on this our constituents would all agree. When we first considered creating this liability shield last June, we were faced with a great deal of uncertainty. We didn't know how we were going to get through this and when we could get back to normal. And we wanted answers to those questions, not just for our own safety before the people who write to us needing help and clarity on how the state was dealing with this pandemic. How do you know what's actually safe, safe and legal in the eyes of the state when every person around you represents a threat to your health, your liberty, if they act irresponsibly. We didn't have a legal framework ready to deal with the potential for harm caused by an airborne infectious disease that we didn't fully yet understand. So in creating this immunity last year, we actually created a legal responsibility for folks to behave appropriately. And we took steps to spelling out what appropriate was. That's why I joined many of you in this chamber to vote for it. But despite what some folks out in the hall and the other chamber said, we haven't had waves of lawsuits crippling our small businesses. In fact, just the opposite. There hasn't been a single successful recovery for any Georgian who has been negligently or maliciously exposed to COVID under these provisions. More than creating a standard of care, we created de facto blanket immunity. And I don't believe for more than a second that there is a single person or single corporation in this state who knew and ignored risks, spread the virus and has caused harm to Georgia workers and consumers. We know this because we know what we've seen this past year. And if you care about the people in the state like I do, and I'm sure you do, you should be hollering mad. I felt like a pot full of water left on a stove that's just barely lit for hours and hours, slowly rising to a bowl every single day this past year. Mr. Speaker, this is a lot less hypothetical when we take into account what's happened across the country this past year. At a meat packing plant in Iowa last spring. And this has been documented in the very kind of litigation the bill we have before us would preempt. Supervisors knew about the hazards that they were sending workers to face. Plant managers are alleged to have explicitly told supervisors to ignore COVID symptoms and organized a betting pool for supervisors to wager on how many employees would test positive. That's the kind of abhorrent and abject disregard for human life that this kind of liability shield has allowed to infiltrate our society this past year. And the same company that owns that facility in Iowa operates a major chicken plant in Albany where cases were the highest per capita in the nation around the same time those actions took place. And it's not just poultry workers we need to be concerned about. We're not talking about the transit workers who have allowed Georgia workers and employees to get to their jobs over the past year who have continued working. We're not talking about the grocery store employees who make sure we have food at home to feed our families. We're not talking about protecting teachers. We're not talking about the transit workers.

But what you heard from the previous speaker is true. This bill does nothing for Georgia employees. We've got over 15,000 dead Georgia's in a health care system on the brink of collapse. With schools closed and bars open across the state, we've got a labor department that can't or maybe just won't process unemployment claims, sending folks on the brink to the food pantry line or back out job hunting. When the entire point of increased benefits that Republicans and Democrats both agreed on was to enable working people to weather this storm in the safety of our homes. We've got a vaccine that's only available if you've got the time and technical capacity to refresh a website every 30 seconds every day of the week. We've seen half measure after half measure fail to solve this crisis and what has filled those gaps. Uncertainty, disinformation, and danger. And instead of trying to tackle any of those issues with this bill, we're trying to let bad actors off the hook. We're shrugging it every day folks, then whispering to corporate interests how they can cover their bottom line. We need to be stronger in setting out the rules business owners must follow to keep working Georgia's safe. Not extending a liability shield that we've seen in practice is both too vague and too broad. Now, most Georgians who've been able to get back to work aren't as lucky to work in a workplace like ours that treats this incredibly transmissible virus as seriously as we do with mask mandates and surveilling testing and plexiglass protectors. I recognize this body is never going to pass a mask mandate for public accommodations. Looking through our own rules, we hypocritically acknowledge it is a responsible safety precaution necessary for us to do our jobs. But what I do ask is that we not continue down the path of prioritizing shareholders and CEOs who don't even live here over the working people of Georgia by passing this measure. I've got a bill that would define the real standard of care for businesses to meet, back to science-based federal OSHA guidelines. And wherever you follow on this vote, I do hope you consider joining me and pushing for more clarity on what actions this community even covers. Without that clarity, this vote is a ceremonial question asking who we really represent. Georgians are multinational corporations. Mr. Speaker, I know there are a number of speakers who want to speak on this, so I'll yield well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, Chair recognizes representative McClain to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you all too, for just me, I guess, rehashing. Last year, we had SB 359, and all we have done is just changed the number of this bill, the SB 112. Again, what have we done? We have prioritized businesses. We haven't done anything for the workers. We have not said anything about what they need. You know, I heard the office say that he had the support of the business community, but did he say he had the support of the workers? No, he did not say that, because they don't support this bill. You know, Georgia is the sixth highest in the country with COVID infection, the sixth highest. You know what that means? That means that there's only five ahead of us and 43 below us. You know, sometime we've got to say that we need to make sure that we can take care of the workers, and who are receiving those? Who are the people that are being affected? Workers. You know, last year I came up to talk against this bill, and I talked about March 16, because March 16 is the one we came to this bill to give the authority to the governor to shut down Georgia. And I say that only because I want you all to know that 15,000 folks have passed in the state of Georgia since that time. But I only have one, my ad man. She called me that monitor on March 16 to share with me that she thought she had pneumonia. That's what she thought. But we know better. Here it is, instead of us ending this, we're extending this. We're extending what we're trying to do with immunity for corporations. Corporations do not need immunity. I mean, you've got to realize that. When I look at where we are and what we should be doing, what we should be doing is taking care of workers, but we're not. You know, and corporate immunity would not be needed if you didn't have bad actors. If you didn't have people, corporations that wanted to get away with murder, we wouldn't need that. We wouldn't need this bill. This bill would not be needed whatsoever. But what do we have? We have corporations that want to make sure that we open up the stores. We have corporations that want to make sure we open up the schools, open up the theaters. Everything wants to be open, but do we want to take care of the workers? Do we want to take care of the workers? If you want to take care of the workers, you would vote no on this. There's now one time that the author said anything about the workers. The other thing he said was business, business, business, business, business, business, but he didn't say one thing about the working men and women. What I want you all to realize is that somebody has got to say something about the working men and women. Is it needed? No. Let working men and women know that the people in this house care about them, care about their lives and also their families life and the safety of their families and the health of their families. But speaker, only thing I can say is we have a responsibility and that responsibility does not pertain to us taking care of a building but taking care of workers and their families. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well. Before we go on, Mr. Clark, would you please read Rule 8.2 of this house. The use of cameras, video cameras, movie cameras, cell phone cameras and similar devices on the floor of the house in the gallery or in the lobbies during any speech or legislative proceeding is prohibited unless expressly authorized by the speaker. Pretty clear. Chair recognizes representative Boate to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in complete opposition to HB 112. Now in my rising, I will not revisit or redebate the original SB 359 COVID-19 business immunity protection bill from last session. However, I will rise in opposition to state that this bill is going to continue not to protect workers. When COVID-19 hit this country in the state last year, everyone was trying to figure out what is this new disease. How do you protect yourself from this new disease? How do you find the personal protective equipment to protect yourself from this disease? COVID-19 hit Georgia hard. So hard that we had to suspend legislative session last year on March 13, 2020. We had to convene a special session on March 16, 2020. So the governor could enact special executive powers. But today, over 750,000 judges have contracted the disease COVID-19. Almost 15,000 deaths have occurred right here in this state. So when COVID first hit this state, we didn't know what it was. We were just all trying to figure it out. That is the reason why it's called the novel virus. Because it was new. In my profession, they call that a case of first impression because you really don't know what you're dealing with. But we know today what we're dealing with. We know the pain that this disease has done. We know the deaths that have occurred because some of those deaths have been our family members, our friends, our classmates. So by passing this bill, HB 112, we're going to continue not to protect workers. And I know some would say that we have to protect businesses. And as my dear friend stated earlier from the Democratic caucus, the sponsor told you time and time again, business, business, business, business. But I don't recall here in the worker spulking one time. What about the people? What about the poultry worker that has to go to work every day to take care of his family that's packed in, what PPEs may not even be available? What about the grocery store cashier that has to go to work every day to get herself through college to take care of her family? Now in front of me, I have a plexiglass. We have plexiglass to protect us from the COVID-19 virus. And you're going to hear some grocery store owners in this particular situation that would say we're social distance in our store. You're going to hear others say that we ask customers to wear masks. You're going to hear others say that we install plexiglass to protect our cashiers. Think about that worker. What happens when an individual in her line costs? Imagine a tear that goes through it because the individual does not have a mask on. If the plexiglass only comes to her, waste. You know what that means, right? The plexiglass is there not for her, not for the worker. It's therefore the cash register. So that means that the cash register is covered. That means the money is protected, but the person is not because it's not a priority of that business to protect that young lady. So I ask you today to vote against this bill because it does not protect workers. We have to do in this chamber. It's to consider workers and consider business and try to merge both together because I'm not anti-business. I'm a small business owner. And I'm not anti medical facilities because I had two grandparents that had to go through medical procedures during COVID. But what I am is pro people. It's time for us to take up and look at people as people and as workers who vote for us, who bring us down here to do the business of the people. Thank you. And Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. General is yielded the well. Chair recognizes representative Wynn to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In this chamber, we often talk about Georgia being the number one place for businesses. But we know that Georgia is not the number one place for workers. And we've seen this even more acutely during the past year as Georgians have battled in unprecedented public health crisis. So today I'm here to speak on behalf of workers, our essential workers who had no choice but to continue to work every single day of this pandemic. They have sustained our economy through the duration of the pandemic, grocery workers, restaurant workers, healthcare workers, poultry workers, food delivery service workers. Those are the people who have made sure that we can safely work from home and take care of our families. And yet we have no protections in place for these workers. I've received numerous reports, emails, calls from workers and constituents who are scared and who are desperate because they're forced to work in unsafe conditions. Conditions in which their employers do not follow the guidelines put forth by the CDC. Conditions where their employers do not provide personal protective equipment. Conditions where their employers do not provide sanitary workspaces and do not protect the health of those who help sustain their businesses. In the most egregious circumstances, there are businesses who won't even allow their own employees to wear a face mask to keep themselves safe. This bill does nothing but deprives workers of a tool to it, hold their employers accountable. Their employers need to follow basic safety precautions to keep safe their workers. And now we have an even more deadly variant strain of this virus. This bill does nothing but enables bad businesses to get away with endangering the health and safety of their workforce. It doesn't incentivize employers to implement the full range of the CDC guidelines for keeping their workplace safe. And lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention that this bill disproportionately impacts our communities of color because black and Latinx workers are dying at a higher rate than any other worker in this state. We should be addressing those inequities. So today, on behalf of workers, the workers who face risk every single day to make our lives easier, to make sure our state is still running, the ones who have sustained our economy, and the ones who live in fear not only for their own lives, but bringing the virus home to their loved ones, to their moms, dad, grandparents, their children. I am here in support of these workers and will be voting against this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. That completes the members who wish to speak against the bill under the rules of the House, the chair of the committee from Lentz the Bill came. As the chairman's time, chair recognizes the majority caucus who have representative Kelly for the chairman's time. 20 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'll return to the well in just a moment. But for the time being, I'm going to yield a portion of my time to representative carpenter and I reserve the balance. Chair recognizes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, I couldn't tell you what the matter was. Too big a hurry here. Chair recognizes representative carpenter for a portion of the chairman's time. Thank you, Speaker. You know, I stand here today and I'm appalled. This bill is not about protecting large corporations. This is about protecting small businesses. And as a small business person, you hear this talk about your employees, employees, they're my family. I went through this pandemic. I worked my butt off with my employees facing COVID, risking my life so that I can keep my employees working because you know what employees want to do? They want to freaking work. They want jobs and this bill protects businesses so there are jobs on the other end of this pandemic. I very rarely agree with straight, web, Kelly on litigation issues. Rarely, but I'm telling you, this bill is a good bill for Georgia small businesses. I mean, it's appalling to me that we had to sit here and listen about, that we don't care about our employees just because I don't want to face a frivolous lawsuit and lose my businesses because at the end of the day, if I lose my business, yes, it affects me, but I have 100 employees that it affects and I have the burden as a business owner to provide for those 100 families. And I can assure you, through this pandemic, it was a boat anchor. It hurt, I grind it and to talk about not attacking employers who simply just want to operate their businesses, to keep their communities going and to keep their employees working. This is disgrace and I love you and I yield the well back to, uh, with Kelly for the remainder of the time. Chair recognizes the chairman of the committee, Representative Kelly. I wonder who's going to take up for the employees, Mr. Speaker, when they don't have any jobs to get, or the employees without having jobs to go to. Yesterday, as I walked out of this Capitol for lunch, I ran to a group of people who had lost their jobs because of this pandemic. I spoke with a group of people who were here crying out for help because they had lost their jobs because of COVID. I could see the hurt in their eyes. You could feel the shame on their voice. When we talk about helping businesses stay open, it's to make sure that those employees have somewhere to go to work and be productive members of society, like I think we all want to do. I talked to the grocery store workers. I talked to the factory workers. I talked to people in the hospitality industry. I talked to the hairdressers and I heard from people that were crying out for the opportunity to go back to work. This pandemic has hit us hard, Mr. Speaker. And I've weak for the lives of every person that has been lost because of COVID. I've personally lost some very close friends because of it. And I know that we also have a responsibility to make sure that we as a people, we as a state continue to allow our economy to stay open so that businesses can continue to grow in the great climate at least. One group in this party is trying to put in place. Chairman England is going through a tough time with her budget. I've heard the criticisms from the minority party about the lack of funding. Let me tell you how you fund a budget. You do it through state tax revenue. And where do you get state tax revenue? Income from businesses and the people that get to work at them. There's only one way. We want to talk about being able to fund our schools, fund our health care. This makes sure we have an opportunity to get the tax revenue. Let's try to be intellectually honest and not speak at a both sides of our mouth. I'll be ready for us to put this vote on the board here in a minute. We're going to get to show George as a clear picture of the priorities of both parties represented in this chamber. One will be the one that continues to want to keep George's economy open for employees to have somewhere to go to work, for the people that have scratched and spent their whole lives trying to build a small business. I don't have any illusions of what this vote is going to look like, but I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. I'm disappointed. There should be things we could work together on here. There should be things we could work together on here. This is one of those things. This is one of those times. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate all the effort that's gone into this measure. I appreciate the support from you and from the other members of my caucus. This is important that we make sure that the doors stay open so the employees can go back to work because they want to. They want to. They want to provide for their families. Our medical facilities need to stay open. We need to be able to treat Georgians without fear of lawsuits. Mr. Speaker, I think I've said all I need to say on this. I'll take a couple of questions and then I'm going to let the people of Georgia see where the majority of minority parties, priorities are. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Knight to your right for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, how are you? To the web. Isn't it true that the first bill we just voted on, the IRC update, had a provision in it by which Georgia is recognizing 100% deduction for meals? Isn't that an effort in which we are putting in by the line item and the amount, $50 million over the next four years is what the cost estimate is on that? Aren't we putting our money back towards businesses, especially the small businesses, the restaurants such as representative carpenters that got out and spoke to eloquently? Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate that question. We voted just a few minutes ago on the IRC update. No one knows that better than you. But the $50 million that we're recognizing in a loss of state tax revenue is so the individuals who choose to go out and eat and we're encouraging their behavior going out to it because we know that these restaurants are having such a hard time and we want to encourage people to go out and eat. And so that's one way again that we've showed that we're trying to support that restaurant industry, but it's important. Not only that we give the deduction, but that we make sure that the doors are open for people who want to go have a meal. And that's what this bill will help do. Thank you for the question. One further question, Mr. Speaker, if the representative of you. Oh, you. Isn't it true that that board had unanimous support for that? It did. Then to the gentleman, I'm not understanding how you could support that measure and not support, providing the protection for not only the restaurants for all of Georgia businesses in order to be open. I appreciate the work you've done on this and I urge everyone support of this bill. I don't understand it either and I'm done trying. I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes, represent our Chairman Dubnik to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Gentlemen, you. Oh, you. Good Kelly, is it not true that I represent the people of Gainesville and Hall County? I know that to be correct. Is it not further true that Gainesville is affectionately referred to as the poultry capital of the world? That's absolutely correct. And is it not further true that during this pandemic, the business owners, the Georgia poultry federation, the suppliers to those plants and manufacturing facilities, and most importantly, the workers, the frontline workers came together in an effort to sit around the table, to find a way for everyone to go to work, to be safe. And it wasn't it those frontline workers who came up with the vast majority of safety protocols to be put in place. I know that to be absolutely correct and the gentleman to be able to speak on it with the passion that he has for his community and the poultry industry as a whole, it is a group effort. It took a lot of people to keep our economy going. It's going to continue to take a lot of us. And I hope that we can all work together to try and make sure that the systems of Georgia have protection, that our employees and our workers have the opportunity to go to work, and that our healthcare community can continue to be protected from frivolous litigation, which would close the doors of so many small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the way. I know you said only two questions, but there's one you may want to take. I'll be glad to, Mr. Chair recognizes the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits, Chairman Hogan, for a question. Yes, sir. Does the gentleman yield? I will. Isn't this all about keeping your favorite place on St. Simon's Southern barbecue? Southern Seoul, your favorite barbecue place in the world, protecting their employees and keeping this business open? The gentleman knows that when I'm busy and down on the coast, I do like to have a little barbecue at Southern Seoul.

and they're a great smile business that operates on St. Simon's like so many restaurants that operate across our state. And we do need to make sure that they continue to keep their doors open as well as the ones like Representative Carpenter, like the numerous others that exist just within steps of this capital and across our great state. I appreciate the question you're speaking. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on House Bill 112? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does Chairman Chokus rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chair, inquiry. Isn't it true that it's chairman of the Small Business Development Committee this morning we heard testimony from restaurants where 20% of the restaurants in Georgia are closed and many of them will not reopen. Isn't it also true that in Small Business the employees, the frontline workers are the most valuable asset, the most valuable asset in Small Business. And I personally was somewhat offended when people said that we, as Small Business people, don't take care of our employees. We have sneeze guards in place and retail establishment. We have masks available. We have thermometers. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I have a thermometer in my briefcase that I take with me not only to check myself but the people that I associate with and make sure we do those health care precautions. We social distance. Is there a parliamentary inquiry in this somewhere? Yes, sir. There he is. There he is. Can we get to it? Yes, sir. Isn't it further true that these things protect Small Business so that we can provide jobs for hard working Georgia? I am sure the gentleman believes very intensely. Yeah, don't forget to vote one way or the other. Chair, for what purpose does representative Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the three people that stood up in the in opposition of this and said that they will worry that the companies will worry about their bottom line or all trial lawyers? And really they can be worried about their bottom line? That's just a country voice. That analogy of it. Well, let's not get into all that now. What purpose does representative Thomas rise? Inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that in our great state of Georgia that we have more employees in this state than we have businesses? And if we speak that we are for the people, but we have not spoken that we are for the employees. And is it not further true that there is no accountability for these businesses if they do not follow the CDC guidelines and these lawsuits if they do not follow the CDC guidelines guidelines are not frivolous? I'm sure the lady believes that to be true for what purpose does the minority caucus who up representative Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that we can have a vigorous debate without attacking each other on the opposite side of the aisle? And is it not further true that we had a bill that we all supported my fellow CPA, supported to build that supported law small businesses? And is it not further true that to get in the well and to attack someone for caring about workers is probably not what this chamber cares about? And is it not that further true that if we had instituted the same mass policy in the marketplace that we've done at the Capitol that we might be a little further along? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think all of our rhetoric can be toned down. Both sides. Both sides. All right, that's all the parliamentary inquiries. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 112. The eyes are 99 and the nays are 68. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Honoring the life and memory of JB Tate. Honoring the life and memory of Ella May Lewis. Honoring the life and memory of William Pete Bridges. Congratulations on the Pierce County Bears football team for winning the 2020 GHSA Class Triple A State Football Championship. Recognizing and congratulating Willie F. Marchman. Commending the Pine Crest Academy football team. Recognizing and commending June merit upon the grand occasion of her retirement. And for other purposes that completes the reading of the privileged resolution. Is there any objection to the adoption of the privileged resolutions? The chair here is none and the resolutions are adopted. We have one more item of business and y'all might want to pay attention. In case anybody hadn't noticed, we've been flying since yesterday without an adjournment resolution. I think the majority leader has now fixed that problem. Chair recognizes, um, Clerk would you read the caption to a resolution please? Senate resolution 82. My senator Dubin of 30th, give it to the 51st Kennedy 18th, Butler of the 55th and others. A resolution relative to meetings in the Germans in general assembly. Chair recognizes the majority leader to present the resolution. House will be at order. If you need to go on, then excuse yourself. Some people might want to know what our schedule is. Gentlemen may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Clerk, if you would put the schedule on the board, thank you. A few folks will take a look at this next schedule in resolution we've come up with that takes us through. First of March, day 25, hopeful that this is something we can all agree on. And I'm very bipartisan, Madam, Mr. Leader. And I believe it's, we've worked on it very diligently. I believe it is always as our scheduling efforts are to be respectful to the members, to their family commitments, to their work commitments, to make sure that they can also take care of their business outside of this, this body. But it also gives us time to make sure we tend to the urgent business that we're here task to take care of. If you will, take a look at it. We come, we, I can say we take this through the first of March, which will be day 25. In four days this week, three days next week, as we take out the President's Day on Monday, and then off on Friday, then five days the last week of this month. And then again, come back in on Monday, March 1st for day 25. That's what the scheduling resolution takes us to, Mr. Speaker. I'd be glad to answer a question, if there are any, or if not, I will be certainly, um, very hopeful that the members of this body will adopt this schedule of resolution, what a positive note. Do you yield for a question? I sure could, yes, sir. Chair recognizes the dean of this house, Dean Smirre to your left. To the majority, though, yesterday we had a conversation, and a lot of members were kind of in the position of seeing that yesterday was our last day, according to the residents that was adopted by the House and sending so forth. And the education purposes education now, new members. Is it not true that if you have a resolution, and the said date is in there, and the agreement is now with the Senate that you can continue to just meet until the clock will deliver runs out. So would you clear that up to members that on yesterday, the reason the rationale was that we can continue on until there's a joint resolution from the House and the Senate. Just wanted to clear it up with some members saw yesterday that we were, that we hear the day, but the resolution said February the eighth was our. Some people thought that was a drop dead date, but it's not we can continue on this legislative session weekends, everything will count unless we have a resolution that's adopted and I was scared. Does that not true? That is true to my friend. I don't think I can explain it any better than it was just explained. Thank you Dean for explaining that and that is no different than this body is always operating under that same premise. And we were able to reach an agreement yesterday, but we're not able to get everything back from the Senate in time. So we have it today and we think it's the right dates are on this or here before us and I would ask for your favorable consideration. You have another question if you care to yield. I'll you for one more of us, Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Bruce to your ride for a question. Will the gentleman yield? How yielded my friend? Thank you, sir. Is there been any agreement on when crossover day is going to be? The, no sir, the Senate has a crossover day, but that's a Senate rule and we will certainly continue to work with the Senate as we consider a crossover day. Thank you, sir. With that, Mr. Speaker. No further questions. Thank you, sir. You will well ask for your favorable consideration. Any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill or the resolution the chair here is done? The report of the committee has agreed to shall this resolution now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of Senate resolution 82. The eyes are 159. The nays are zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, I want to ask you to read House Rule 133. Rule 133. When the question is put every member within the chamber shall vote unless the members immediately and particularly interested therein or unless the members excused by the House. The motion by a member to be excused from the voting must be made before the House divides or before the call of the A's and Nays is commenced and shall be decided without debate. The member making the motion may briefly state the reason why it should prevail. In every case where the seat of a member is being contested, the sitting member in the contestant shall both retire from the House before the vote is taken. Does anyone not understand that rule? The sitting in your seat and not voting violates the rules of the House. Now, before we got started this session, I encouraged all of you to read the rulebook. Today we've had to remind you of a couple. The next step will be enforcement. We're going on now to announcements. Chair recognizes representative Bernal for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
