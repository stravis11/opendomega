TRANSCRIPT
----------
So I'd like to introduce Senator Reverend Kim Jackson.
Well, good afternoon.
Today we stand to say no to executing people who have intellectual disabilities.
Today we stand to say we recognize that people who have intellectual disabilities
are not able to make conscious decisions that should lead to their execution.
And today we stand together as a collective, as clergy, as people of faith,
and people of simple, good moral character, who are saying no more in this state.
The state of Georgia has worked really hard over the years to be a forefront
and a leader around certain issues within the death penalty.
But this is one place where we fall in short.
We continue to execute people who simply should not be on death row.
And so today I am proud to work alongside our House Representative Bill Workhouseer on
this bill that will change the tide for Georgia and help move us to a more just society.
A society where we recognize that people who went to special education their entire lives,
who we know have been documented as having intellectual disabilities, that we are going
to be a state that has good moral character and that we will not execute them.
So I am grateful to my colleague for sponsoring HB 1014 and I look forward to getting across
the chambers to the Senate where we can support it and get it all the way across the finish
line.
With that, I'd like to introduce Representative Workhizer.
Thank you Senator Kim, and thank you for those, all those folks behind me who have traveled
and come to our capital to advocate.
And has been said, Georgia, there's only 27 states that allow executions.
And Georgia is the only state that has beyond a reasonable doubt for determination of those
who are intellectually disabled.
The only state, there are also the only state that that determination is made during the
innocent guilt phase after the facts of the case have been made, so it's very biased.
bill fixes both those issues so that we're no longer the outlier in the country.
And so it's a narrowly defined part of our death penalty code and looking forward to
passing it and thank you for Senator Kim and her work.
We'll get it through both chambers and look forward to this becoming law.
Any questions from the media?
The difference in this bill, thank you.
We have had bills in the past that have been total repeals of the death penalty.
This is not that.
This bill narrowly is focused toward those who are truly, intellectually, developmentally
would be proven in a court of law
that they would pass that standard
by a preponderance of evidence.
That great question.
This bill was actually given to me by leadership.
So yes.
So that's the exciting part.
I think we've got a good headway.
The other seven sponsors on the bill are all attorneys and judges.
It's a very bipartisan, half of them are Republicans, half Democrats.
And so I think it's a bipartisan issue that we can all agree on.
Great question.
else. Well thank y'all for coming and thank you for this group for your
efforts. I am Kathy Harmon Christian and I am the executive director for
Georgians for alternatives to the death penalty and I wanted to mention that
oh wonderful let me just pause that for now and I would love to introduce a
representative Deborah Silcox who is one of our wonderful co-sponsors for this
legislation. Representative Silcox. Thank you so much, Kathy. I so appreciate you. Giving
me just a brief moment here. I don't want to take much time, but I just want to say that
I think that House Bill 1014 is the right thing to do. And I know that we still have some
more work to do on the bill, but I'm very hopeful that we can give people with intellectual
disabilities, a break in the courts, certainly when faced with the death penalty.
So thank you for your attention and support of this issue.
I think it's very important to accomplish justice in Georgia.
Thank you.
And we also want to leave time if any of the other co-sponsors are able to come.
But I did want to draw your attention to this one
And we're happy to share that so you can look more into the legislation.
And I wanted to also draw your attention to two of the logos on the piece of paper.
And that's from the New Disabled South.
We have the community, disabled community with us on this legislation.
And we also have conservatives concerned about the death penalty with us.
So there's a broad consortium of people who are supporting this legislation.
and now I would like to turn to some of our faith leaders to speak about their
support for this bill. May I introduce? Let's start with Ms. Joya Aaron Thornton
please. Thank you Kathy. Good morning everyone. I want to send a special thank
Thank you to Senator Kim Jackson, our sponsors, Representative Workhizer, and also Representative
Stillcawks.
Thank you so much for believing in this bill.
This is something we've been trying to do for a very, very long time.
I am Joya Aaron Thornton.
I am the Executive Director of the Faith Leaders of Color Coalition or Flock.
As one of the national partners on this effort, I can't say thank you enough to our partners
and also all of the supporters behind me for this bill,
face leaders matter.
Faith leaders can move mountains.
I urge policy leaders to continue to engage faith leaders
in the participatory policy processes
that are needed to make this country
and this state more equitable.
Thank you, Kathy.
Good afternoon, I'm Bishop Ned Slesinger for the Archdiocese of Atlanta, and I'm here
today on behalf of my brother, Bishop's in both the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the
diocese of Savannah.
Our clergy and the growing number of Catholic Christians who now number roughly 1.3 million
in the state of Georgia.
I want to personally thank Representative at Work Heiser for his work and the other
Georgia House co-sponsors with House Bill 1014 for their leadership on this issue.
As an auxiliary bishop of Atlanta, I share with you many belief that the dignity of every
human life is never to be played down or under emphasized in the case of someone who has
done great evil. No matter how heinous the crime, if society can protect itself without
ending a human life, it should do so. When the state, in our names, and with our tax
dollars, ends a human life, despite having non-lethal alternatives, it suggests that society
He can overcome violence with violence.
When Cain killed Abel, God did not end Cain's life, instead he sent Cain into exile, not
sparing his life or protecting it by putting a mark on Cain, lest any one should kill him
at sight.
Catholics believe in prioritizing the protection of the poor and vulnerable, and those
Those who are vulnerable in a special way are those who have intellectual disabilities.
We see that a person with an intellectual disability in this state faces the threat of execution
because he or she cannot meet the highest standard of proof of their intellectual disability.
Georgia was the first state to pass a law intended to prevent the execution of people with
intellectual disabilities. Sadly, we are now the only state whose laws make it so difficult
to prove that intellectual disability that no one can meet that burden of proof.
My dear brothers and sisters, let us not neglect our role as our brother and sisters keeper
and advocate with our representatives
for that dignity of every person,
especially those who have intellectual disabilities
by showing our constant support
for a fast-passing house bill 1014.
Once again, thank you,
Representative Workhizer, for your great work,
and all of you.
Thank you, Bishop Ned, and I would like to now introduce another one of our wonderful
co-sponsors, Representative Matt Reeves.
Well, do you want to say anything?
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
I am honored to support this good bill.
I appreciate Chairman Workhizer, Representative Silcox,
and the faith community for working hard on this issue
for many years.
In addition to the moral concerns that were expressed
eloquently, my reason for being involved in this bill
is there are some US Supreme Court warnings on this issue
that we need to clean up here in Georgia.
So I'm proud to support this bill to make sure
that we fully comply with the US Supreme Court,
the highest court in the land.
Thank you.
All right, I'm going to try not to be on the other end, I mean, I mean, I mean, it's all the most exciting together.
Here we go.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you so much, representatives. We so appreciate you. Now I'd also like to welcome
Reverend John Vaughan, who will also speak in support of this legislation.
So the representatives of this bill, thank you. This is the right thing to do, as has been
said, and this is a step in the right direction. I bring you greetings on behalf of the historic
These are Baptist Church and our senior pastor, the Reverend Dr. Raphael G. Warnut.
So this is a step in the right direction.
We're clear where we stand in relationship to the death penalty for, we worship a God
of second chances and third chances and fourth chances and we believe the transformation
is possible.
So we stand here in support of this as a good next step.
I want to thank my clergy colleagues and lay leaders
for being here and standing up for this important legislation.
Thank you again for your leadership.
And indeed, this is a step in the right direction.
Amen.
Thank you so much, Pastor Vaughn, and now I'd like to introduce Reverend Carol Maddox.
I'm Carol Maddox.
I'm Executive Director of the Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center and Archdeacon for
the Episcopal diocese of Atlanta, I bring greetings on behalf of my bishop, Rob Wright,
and on behalf of many people of faith and clergy who have stood up to say, one of the most
important gifts God gives us is our lives. I think we all understand that and we all believe
that. One of the big responsibilities that come with that gift is the
responsibility of taking care of the vulnerable, the children, and the
disabled. We don't execute children and we can't execute the disabled
either. I thank you for all the clergy who have signed the faith leaders
letter over 150 from across this beautiful state have stood up and said it is wrong to
execute the intellectually disabled. Thank you very much and thank you Representative
Workhouse for your work and for your leadership.
And now I'd like to introduce Emily Mendoza-Waters from the Catholic Mobilizing Network.
Good afternoon.
My name is Emily Mendoza-Waters and I work at Catholic Mobilizing Network where a national
Catholic organization to end the death penalty and promote restorative justice.
I'm so grateful that Georgia was the first state to pass law exempting people with intellectual
disabilities from the death penalty. It made a statement that Georgia cared about the
most vulnerable people in the community. However, because of the required, higher standard
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, we know that most, the most vulnerable people were
not protected. Georgia stands alone in the U.S. with this burden of proof.
As a person of faith and many of the people behind me are people of faith, we believe that
every life is sacred and we have the responsibility to protect the dignity of all people, especially
those most vulnerable.
The past two weeks, speakers who have been directly impacted by violence traveled all around
the state to share their lives with Georgians, many of them are behind here.
It is so appropriate that the journey of hope is ending here at the Capitol.
It has been a long journey and will continue to be, however, it is filled with the possibility
of hope and change.
You can be a part of this change by ending this injustice.
You can be a part of this change by encouraging your leaders to support legislation that will
protect the constitutional rights of people with intellectual disabilities.
You can be a part of this change by helping to prevent more executions of the most vulnerable
in the community.
You can be a part of this change and give hope.
Thank you so much for your leadership and for all of your work and organization.
And one of my colleagues is here from Tennessee, who's been doing work there on intellectual
disabilities and the death penalty.
Rafia, Mohammed, McCormick, welcome.
Thank you very much, Kathy.
I just want to say that I'm happy to be joining Georgians in this fight to remove intellectual
disability as being a precursor and allowing those people to be executed. Tennessee was able to pass
this in 2021 and we are happy to see that Georgia is included as well. This is extremely important
legislation and we are glad to be here. All right we're going to wind up now and I just want to
to suggest you're welcome to join us for more lunch here in room 216.
Please join us have further conversation and support 10 House Bill 1014.
Thank you so much.
