you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well, good morning. Happy Monday to you. A couple of things before we begin today. I just learned just as I took the podium, the representative Clint Crow. His mother is in very, very critical condition. He just lost his father a few weeks ago. So when we pray this morning, let's remember representative Crow. I also want to say, as I did last Thursday, our ask that we pray for the people of Ukraine this morning. They continue courageously defending their nation against an unwarranted and unprovoked invasion by the Russian Federation. Understand that ceasefire talks have begun and we will hope and pray that those are successful. The interesting to note that even Russia's own citizens have turned against their governments in curation, protesting in the streets and being detained as a result of their protest and not cheering on this senseless barbaric violence. Here at home this morning our House Budget and Research Office has reached out to all of the state's investment arms, ERS, TRS and others. We've asked if the state of Georgia holds any investments in Russian equities or other assets. And if so, we will set about work to divest those assets with all due haste. I don't know about you all but I don't want one penny of a Georgian's money going to subsidize Vladimir Putin. While our role in international affairs is limited, we make clear that our people stand with those who want to live in peace. Now we will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the Chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the Lady from the 94th House District Representative Karen Bennett, Representative Bennett. Thank you Mr. Speaker and good morning. Today is my pleasure to introduce our Chaplain for today. For many years you have seen Representative Hugley, Representative Kendrick and myself come before you each January to hail A.K.A. Day and A.K.A. Founders today. Today we have a special minister who represents Alpha Kappa Alpha, so we are going to incorporate it. She represents all of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. But today Mrs. Carolyn G. Randolph from Columbus, Georgia and the Columbus delegation is here. She is an awesome and tremendous faith leader. She has been a member of the 4th Street Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia for 28 years. She serves as the chairman of the Women's Ministry, Church School Teacher, and also she serves as a member of the Christian Education Department. She is a member of the Pastore Relations Committee and the Deacon Wives Ministry. Mrs. Randolph has made her mark in prayer. She has established a region-wide prayer service every Tuesday night. And so we are just so happy to have with us this faith leader, a tremendous woman of God. Mrs. Carolyn G. Randolph from Columbus, Georgia. Mrs. Randolph. To speak to David Waston and to all members of the Georgia House of Representatives, good morning. I give honor to God for this opportunity and I give thanks to you for the invitation. So thank you Representative Karen Bennett for this recommendation. Please allow me to acknowledge my representatives here that serve Muscoge County. Thank you so much. I bring you greetings from the beloved pastor and church 4th Street Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia, where we are a Bible-based church spiritually taught and led by our pastor Dr. J. H. Flakes III. As I stand here today, I am marveled at the works of God and how He made us. If you can listen to these words with your heart, you will know how special each of you are to Him. For in the book of Psalms, David writes in chapter 31, 39 verses 13 and 14, for it was you who created my inward parts. You knit me together in my mother's womb. I will praise you because I have been fearfully and wonderfully made. Wondafally made, even though we are not the same race. Wondafally made, even though we do not have the same background. Yes, wonderfully made, even though we don't have the same thought. Wondafally made, He made each of us differently. We call it today diversity. God said that despite the fact that we are different, we must love one another. And John 3, 18, tell us dear children, let us not love in words or speech, but with actions and in truth. Love, it guides us every day. Love that wakes us up in the morning and rocks us to sleep at night. Love that can penetrate even the hypocrisy of politics. I like to close by sharing a portion of a poem titled this moment by Paul F. Barnett. And it reads, I may never see tomorrow there is no written guarantee. And things that happen yesterday belongs to history. I cannot predict the future. I cannot change the past. I have just this present moment I must treat it as my last. I must use this moment wisely for its own way past away and be lost to me forever as a part of yesterday. I must exercise compassion, help the fallen to their feet, be a friend to the friendless, make an empty life complete. The unkind things I do today may never be undone and friendships I feel to win may never more be one. I may not have another chance on bend it knee to pray and to thank God with all my heart for giving me this day. I may never see tomorrow. Let us pray. Father God, thank you for allowing us to be in this place at this time. Thank you. I'm heavenly Father for allowing each member present today another opportunity to do it right and to get it right. Thank you for your new mercies every day. Although your grace and mercy is beyond our understanding, we stand today as a testimony, as a benefactor and as a servant. Lord, we come to you today asking a special prayer for Representative Crow. Lift him up, lift his family up, help them to look to the heels from whence come at all of their help. We bring to you in place at your feet the citizens of Ukraine. Lord, we ask them to raise their hands as Moses did and lift this battle up to you. For you are, you are our sustainer and you always declare our victory. I pray that your word goes forth with this message empowered by the Holy Spirit. We humbly leave it at your feet in the mighty name of Jesus, amen. You just to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation across, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

It's the best we can do if everybody wants to be heard. The record is representative Wolenski for a morning order. Thank you, speaker. I got 45 seconds. It's going to be like a machine guy. But look at this picture up here, y'all. Scott Ergoady posted this yesterday. He's got 27,000 shares on Facebook. Look at this guy. 45 years old. Jewish. Got a cute wife. By all the indications, the doors are two young kids. This picture feels like when I scroll past on my Facebook feed every day. It may as well be a stock photo from a buddy's kids birthday party yesterday. Yet this is the same guy as the democratically elected charismatic head of state of the largest country in Europe, whose courage and cleverly fighting back Putin's tyranny at a terrifying real and likely fatal danger to both himself and everyone else in this picture is inspiring both in his nation and the world. The human tip of the tip of the spear, leading humanity, and our suddenly hot global fight to defend freedom. Read that paragraph. I can't finish. But y'all, so much politics and foreign policy can be messy and multi-layered and therefore often hard to properly adjudicate right versus wrong, good versus bad. This one is not that. And I'm in all this minute is bravery. I know I read that fast, but thank you for the post, Scott Ergoady. Okay, recognize his representative, Kausha, for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, the war in Ukraine hits home for me much closer than maybe some of you may understand. And just to give you an idea, the distance from Berlin to you, the Krain border, is about the same as a distance from Atlanta to Richmond, Virginia. When I talk to friends and family in Germany, they are more than concerned, they are scared. They talk about world war three and that includes the possibility of a nuclear war. While Ukrainians defend their country, their family, and their lives, we cannot dismiss that war is testing Western alliances to the core. After all, freedom is not free. I grew up in West Germany during the Cold War. I knew I could depend on the Western Alliance to defend us. But now the threat has become grave. My heart goes out to Ukrainians and we need to reign in Russian autocratic aggression sooner rather than later for the sake of all of us because our freedom depends on it. Thank you. If anyone wants to carry their morning order over, till tomorrow, come see Betsy, because not everybody is going to be reached today. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams, representative Deloge, Chairman Hitchens, and Chairman War Cizer for a morning order. And that includes all of the members of the Savannah delegation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We rise this morning because the atrocities in Ukraine has reached close to home this past week after the invasion. 3,800 troops from the third ID at Fort Stewart were deployed and the 165th Air National Guard from Fort Stewart, Hunter Army Airfield were deployed. These young men and women are now in harm's way. And this is a time we all must come together and support this effort. Now we have young men and young women who came from Georgia, did not question why, but mounted up and went prepared to meet this aggression wherever it may happen. Regardless of political affiliation, this is now an American question. Do we, the builders of the greatest democracy in the history of the world, stand for what we have spoken about for many generations? Since 1941. troops from Fort Stewart have answered the call wherever it might be. So I'm going to ask you now if you would join me in a moment of prayer for the safety of our troops. Or might enable us to thank God we come before you, Lord, asking you to put your head of protection around these brave young and women, young men and women who must now go and have called upon, defend your crane or defend these United States of America. Lord, we ask you to remember the families that are left behind, give them comfort and peace as they wonder anxiously about their loved ones. And Lord, we also ask you to cleave to the top of the mouth any tone that speaks negatively about this mission. Lord, some things are bigger than any of us, but being an American citizen carries some responsibility and that is to aggressively defend these freedoms that we so enjoy. We thank you, Lord. Thank you for this opportunity. We know with the odds against them in Ukraine means nothing because the battle is not chose. It's the Lord. And we depend on his decision as to which way this will go. We ask, expressing in the name of the majestic one, Jesus the Christ, amen. I'm going to mine. Chair recognizes Representative Levart and Representative Prince for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to take a brief moment here on the last February to say a few words about a dear friend, Judge Jack Ruffin. It's been over 12, about 12 years since we lost him, but his legacy endures. He was from Augusta, but his legacy extends to all of Georgia. He was a man of many first. He was the first African American member of the Augusta bar. He was the first African American judge on the Augusta judicial circuit and the first chief judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals. Above all, he was a man known for his keen intellect and his rapier sharp quick wit. We never knew what Judge Ruffin was going to say to disarm him. And he was a fierce advocate and attorney for the causes he represented. My father litigated against him, but always said that no matter how zealous he was, he was always courteous and kind to everybody, including those with whom he disagreed. He was a man of tremendous integrity. And I just wanted to say a few words about him this morning. Would we all have such a legacy as Judge Ruffin? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Campbell, Representative Campbell for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker. I appreciate it. I come to the way I'll just to tell you that Carl Schiver, a very good friend of mine and also worked together for 35 years, was rushed into open heart surgery just a little while ago so I solicit your prayers, my prayers for success and a moment of silence for him this time. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman LeHood and Representative Burnow for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We rise today to recognize Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Georgia State Capitol today. There are over 150,000 Georgians currently living with Alzheimer's and a lot more that are living with Alzheimer's but undiagnosed. There are over 300,000 caregivers who provide care, a lot of unpaid care paid at close to $9 billion. So thank you for helping us recognize Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Capitol. And they're doing their advocacy day virtually this year because of the uncertainties when they were planning around COVID. But they are present and they appreciate your support. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you. Chair, I'm sorry. Thank you. I just want, I know that there are several members in this house that have lost their parent or somebody really close to them due to Alzheimer's and I lost my mother due to Alzheimer's and I just wanted us to do a quick moment of silence just for our family members and our friends. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Frazier for a morning order representative Frazier. She waves and that completes our time for today. If we didn't get to you, come see the messenger and sign back up. But we are out of time for morning orders today and we're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Chair will clerk or read the caption to House Bill 1274. House Bill 1274, Congressman Carson, the 46th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter one in Title 50 to fiscal to Georgia and to be relating the general provisions relative to state government chose to provide for the definition of anti-Semitism. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends a disbile due pass. Chair recognizes chairman Carson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is House Bill 1274. This bill codifies a definition of anti-Semitism for the first time. It codifies the definition as per the international Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, IHRA, which is now the consensus international standard because it can be utilized to objectively assess all ideological forms of anti-Semitism. The IHA IHRA definition is used by the U.S. Department of Education, Department of Justice and Department of State. It is also adopted by the European Union, 34 countries of the IHA and nearly two dozen other countries, including states of South Carolina and Florida, and we thank many more to continue. The support for codifying a definition of anti-Semitism is nonpartisan in the federal anti-Semitism Awareness Act, passed by the Senate by unanimous consent. There's been a couple of questions in regard to this legislation. One is why don't we take the definition that the IHA scripted out and replace that into our code. The reason we don't want to do that is we don't want to attack a lot of edits to this. We want to rely on what the IHA defines as anti-Semitism. I apologize, it might be some of the flyers that the pro-Jewish groups handed out, but I'm going to read it for you. Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and or their property toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. So folks, I wanted to ask you to support this bill, to finally put it into code, a definition of anti-Semitism, and with that Mr. Speaker, we yield the well if there's no questions. You do have questions. I will take one question, sir. I recognize this representative.

If Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. First, I want to thank you for acknowledging that anti-semitism has no place in our state and our country. And I really applaud the goals that you seek to accomplish with this bill. But I do have some concerns. So I want to just start with you read out the definition that would be the code in our Georgia code. But you did not read out the several bullet points that follow that definition. Will those bullet points also be a part of our Georgia code if we sign onto this? If we sign onto this in this form, I think what the lady is talking about are the contemporary examples of anti-semitism. And there's been some debate back and forth. What we would like to do is get this bill passed to so that we codify anti-semitism. If we go back and forth about this example or that example, or we're going to refer to this or that or what have you, we could go on and on. I mean, there are a page or more of various examples. What we're more interested in is making sure there's a clear definition as opposed to picking and choosing examples. But I appreciate the question. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. So that's actually my question. I want to clarify, are we only codifying that three line definition that you read out? Or are we also codifying the contemporary examples also listed in the working definition? We are only codifying the working definition. The three lines. All right. And then does the gentleman yield for one final question? Yes, ma'am. So the IHRA states on that website where they have the working definition that this is really meant to be more for education and is not meant to be legally binding. And the author of the definition itself had expressed concerns that this could be used to chill free speech. And so he said that he did not want it to become law. If they express that they don't want it to be legally binding, then why are we legally binding it today? What I would remind the lady is lines 50 to 53 of the bill. And if you go to that to section C, nothing in this code section shall be considered to diminish. They are in French upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the US Constitution or the Georgia Constitution. So free speech rights are protected here. What this is in regard to is a working definition of anti-semitism when it comes to crimes. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I know there are some other speakers in regard to this legislation. So I will yield the well, sir. There are other speakers. Chair recognizes representative Becky Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, colleagues. I rise today out of a deep love for this body and for the Jewish people and for all people who have experienced discrimination and prejudice in their lives. I rise today to speak against this bill, House Bill 1274. I just realized today that the spill would be on the floor. So I am going to use my time to read an opinion piece from some Jewish Georgian friends about this. We are Jewish Georgians who personally know that anti-semitism is dangerous, life threatening, and growing. However, we oppose the passage of Georgia House Bill 1274, which attempts to provide a legal definition of anti-semitism. The problem with the bill is that it uses the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, IHRA definition of anti-semitism, which includes examples of criticism of Israel as anti-semitic. The idea, the idea that political criticism of a nation state is the same as hatred and violence against someone because they are Jewish, has become a powerful tool in the hands of those who work to silence Palestinian voices. The species application of the charge of anti-semitism has already had a chilling effect on free speech and advocacy for Palestinian rights across the country. Pro-Israel activists have used it to silence people calling for a boycott of Israel, to cancel protests, speeches, and university lectures on Palestine, to prevent university students from forming a student group advocating for justice for Palestinians and to pressure Facebook, Zoom, and YouTube to shut down webinars that feature Palestinian speakers. The IHRA definition of anti-semitism is far from being internationally accepted. In fact, scholars worldwide, specializing in the Holocaust Jewish and Middle East studies purposefully gathered to craft the Jerusalem Declaration of Anti-Semitism, claiming that the IHRA definition has caused confusion and generated controversy hence weakening the fight against the anti-semitism. Many Jewish organizations and individuals, including, as Representative Clark mentioned, the definitions lead draft or can it stern, have ejected to his use as a weapon to suppress free speech. Stern has written, if you think this isn't about suppressing political speech, contemplate a parallel. There is no definition of anti-black racism that has the force of law. If you were to craft one, would you include opposition to affirmative action, to include opposing removal of Confederate statues? The effect of applying the IHRA definition have been found to be problematic throughout the country. If made into Georgia law, this conflation of anti-semitism and legitimate criticism of Israel will not eliminate hate, bigotry, and acts of violence. It will only serve to blur the meaning of real anti-semitism and to discredit the struggle against it. Jewish people are already protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We need our lawmakers to uphold these existing laws, to protect Jewish people and other targeted groups. We don't need a law that violates our first amendment right to free speech. With that, I conclude my comments, and I ask you to join me in voting no on HB1274. Do you have no question? You do have a question. Do you? Yes, I do. Chair recognizes Chairman Eftraceon. Do you're left for a question? It's a general lady of yield. Yes. May I may I misnate true that the examples that you cited were examples in the definition that are not included in the definition as incorporated into the bill here? That is what the speaker before me said. Okay, so isn't it true that even if there were examples that went to if criticizing the state of Israel would be captured, those examples aren't part of the legislation that's before the House now? I would agree that's true. I would also add though that the use of this type of law can be used to suppress those questions. That is the fear of the people that are opposing this bill. Do you further yield? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans. Do you're left for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? Yes, I do. We all seem to be on the same page that the illustrations or illustrations, the definition is the definition. But since no one has read any of the illustrations, I wanted to see if you would agree with me that the very first illustration says criticism is Israel similar to that level against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic due agree with me that that's in the illustrations. I'm so can you repeat it one more time? Criticism of Israel similar to that level against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic. Do you agree with me that that's in the very first illustration? That is for criticism of Israel cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic. And do you further agree with me that one of the other illustrations says specifically applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation is also an illustration meaning it cannot be considered that we wouldn't expect the people of Israel not to stand up for their country any less than we would expect Americans to stand up for them. Isn't that the kind of protection that we're talking about in here for the people of Israel, not Israel as a state? Do you agree with me that that's in the illustrations? I'm not sure I would agree with that. Thank you. Questions? I yield the well. Ladies yielded the well. Chair recognizes Representative Holly. Okay, he waived. I'm sorry. Chair recognizes Representative Walenski to speak to the bill. Thank you all speaker. I don't speak for the Jewish people today. I speak for myself. I didn't pick this but I am the only Jewish person in the Georgia legislature right now. What is anti-Semitism? If I asked you right now would you be able to tell me what anti-Semitism is? It's complicated. Because Judaism is a national origin. It's a race. It's a religion. You can't compare this to a race. You can't compare this to an identity because it is more complex. The state of Israel was founded through a democratic process. It wasn't given. It was voted to have an Israeli state and a Palestinian state. But this bill is not about that in any way. This is about Georgia and how we're going to protect Jewish people, how we're going to define anti-Semitism, and why we need to define it. Anti-Semitism comes in many forms. It comes in many ways. And at any point in time right now, if we're looking in a setting of criminal or civil or otherwise, a prosecutor otherwise can say almost anything is anti-Semitism. That's why we need these guardrails today. We heard before that there's some suggestion that should be for learning. Well, people are going to learn. When we put it in the Georgia code, and people learn what anti-Semitism is, and we teach them what not to do, how not to compare or call out Jewish people. That's what we're doing today. We are making sure the use of anti-Semitism is not used improperly, but we give a specific definition of what it is. And it's true as Representative Asks, it says in those examples that criticism Israel is similar to that level against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitism. Because it's not. When we talk about United States or other countries or Israel as a country, as a government, that's fine. But when we say Jewish people are doing something, when we say Jewish people run something, control something, are acting like something, that's anti-Semitism. In no way does this limit the free speech of Israel? This bill in no way limits the free speech against Israel. Sorry. You can speak out against Israel once this bill is passed. You can do it passionately. You can say the government is not treating another country well, just like you would do any other country in war right now. Hatred is born of ignorance. What we are doing today is we are helping people not be ignorant about what anti-Semitism is. I yield for a question, Speaker. You have a question if you care to yield. I will yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons. Do you hear the left for a question? Thank you, Speaker. It's a gentleman to you. Yes. He's a true first of all. I'm trying real hard to, I want to support the bill, but I do have questions about it. It helped me. I'm not an attorney. I don't know if you are or not, but I'm struggling with the, we have, the bill talks about definitions of anti-Semitism. But is there any place in the all that you know of, that doesn't seem to be in this bill? Is there any definition of a semi, what a semi-tism is? Because it seems to me from looking at definitions in the, the definition of semi-tism, that semi-t goes beyond you and goes on, on to Arabs and people from that region of the country. I mean, is that true or is not true? Is what you're not true? That semi means multiple things. Well, first of all, is it not true that there is no definition in the bill of a semi-tism? I'm also asking, if you know if there is any definition in Georgia law, that's what a semi-tism, I guess, there's my two core questions. Can you, if you can answer those? I'm really trying to find a way to support this bill. Yeah, well, I'd love you to support this bill. So right now anti-Semitism is at an all-time high. Worst than before World War II. I've gotten a call in the past three months about anti-Semitic acts against elementary school students, military, I mean middle school students from four different counties. We've seen it on our college campuses. We see it in the news almost every day. So why we are defining anti-Semitism today is to show what anti-Semitism is. I can't speak of other definitions in the code and other meanings. I've never actually heard a question asked about, I've never heard a question like that in my fourth year. And I've never heard, I understand we're defining this today, but let me break down the word and ask you about this other word. So today we're defining anti-Semitism, focusing on bad. What does gentleman for the yield? Yes. If we're defining anti-Semitism, it would seem to me, isn't true, that there needs to be a definition of what a semi-diss, of what's a semi-dissimism is. And if you look in the dictionaries, it goes beyond the Jewish people. OK. So I think what's helpful here is if semi-dissimite is already defined in our dictionary, we don't need it in the Georgia code. However, what anti-Semitism is really complex and that's why we're choosing to apply that here today. Well, I feel you'll have one more than I will sit down. But your definition, it would seem to be in conflict with lines 24 and 25 of this bill. Is that not true? Can you read those lines, please? This is in a definition from the IHRA, contemporary manifestations of anti-Semitism and include useful examples of discriminatory anti-Israel acts that can cross the line into anti-Semitism. That is a fabulous statement. That unfortunately right now, people say anti-Semitic things, but hiding it by speaking about Israel. But really, when people are talking about the Jewish people doing actions, doing harmful things, they, you know, when they're actually saying it about the Israeli government, that they disagree, that's fine. We can disagree with governments. We disagree with our own government. We disagree with our president. That's fine. But when you say the Jewish people is doing something that's anti-Semitic. Thank you. You've got several questions if you care to yield. I'll yield for another question. Chair recognizes Chairman Setsler to your right for a question. Does Jim and you? Yes. Appreciate the debate on this. Appreciate we're getting into the weeds. I want to ask the question. I'm just struggling with line 42 says, as you said, the code section, the term anti-Semitism has the same meaning as provided for the working definition of anti-Semitism, the International Holocaust and Remarants Alliance, May 26, 2016. Why don't we just take the language from that and write it into our code? If we want Georgians to understand that, this is the law. This is the shouts of the state of Georgia. Why don't we take that language and write it plainly in the law is my first question. I'd like to have one more follow up. That's a great question, representative. The reason is the IHRA definition is an international definition. It's been applied by 30, it's been accepted by 30 countries, including our own over 20 different states. And that definition, as it whole, stands for itself. And I understand this body and you and many in here are smart people. But this bill has to go to the other side to the Senate, where if that IRA definition was in there, they may want to pick and choose. But that's not what we're doing here. We're here to say the IRA definition clearly expresses what anti-semitism isn't. And that's what we're applying here today. And we don't need to mess with that definition, because it's accepted. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, has yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered as Chair Here's None? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair Here's None, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I? Those opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines? What purpose does representative Clark rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Parliamentary and Court. Statue in Quarry. Is it not true that during the committee hearing on this bill, Mr. David Goldman, who is of the ACLU and who is also Jewish, spoke against this bill and said that they oppose this bill because it could chill free speech. I was not asked to committee hearing. What purpose does representative Holly rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue in Quarry. Is it not true that while I have the highest respect for the sponsor of this bill and to North Springs High School graduates as we are, I am very definitely a lot of respect for the Jewish people that I certainly respect more so the Jewish voices definition of amitacemitism. And I know that this one unfortunately will be used against teachers in colleges, and therefore I will be voting no against it. Gentlemen, so states, have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of the bill, the eyes are 141. The nays are 19. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1064. To be entitled an act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 7 of Title 48, the Fisher voted Georgia, and to enter the imposition to rate computation exemptions and credits from state income tax. This bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Petrie to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm proud to present to you today House Bill 1064. This bill is a priority for Governor Kim, for this session. And as I think all of you are aware, we need to first acknowledge that we have here in Georgia and in this chamber in particularly addressed a multitude of issues to address making Georgia a military and a veteran friendly state. But there is one more important thing we can do, and I think that is the bill we're looking at today. This is probably the most important thing. I think we can do to complete that effort. So very simply, this bill exempts up to $17,500 of income received from military retirement benefits from state income tax for individuals under 62 years of age. And I want to emphasize that because remember at 62, we already between 62 and 64 already have an exemption based on all retirement income and it increases at 64 to $65,000. So this is targeted to individuals leaving military service under 62. Moreover this bill exempts an additional $17,500 in military retirement benefits from state income tax for those individuals if they work and earn at least $17,500 from another source. So these individuals are going to leave military service from a career in military service, typically around 20 years. You discover that the average age of individuals retirement from military service between 42 and 47. And this bill is very much focused on encouraging those individuals to live and to work in Georgia. And so in the aggregate, a career military retiree could earn with this measure a total exemption of $35,000. This bill rewards men and women who have sacrificed the most for this country, but it also addresses the number one need we hear every day back home from our businesses and industry, workforce. This bill is targeted to encouraging these men and women who are skilled and disciplined and patriotic men and women coming out of military service to live and to work in Georgia where they're needed so much by our industry across the state. It also deals with one final issue I want to point out today, and that is an issue of a current disincentive for these men and women to live in Georgia, especially in border counties like my own, Chairman Smith and Columbus, me and Savannah and Augusta, my colleagues there, Val Dosta, my friends, these individuals can cross the river and save 5.75% of their income. It's a real disincentive we have today, and this addresses that issue because currently in every border state, every state that borders Georgia, they have already addressed this issue in some manner or another. And so it's very important that we deal with that disincentive. That very simply is what we do and seek to accomplish in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to answer any questions there may be in this matter. You've got a couple of questions that you care to yield. Yes, sir. I'm glad to yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark to your left for a question. To my friend, will you yield? Yes, I yield. Isn't it true that as the Chairman of the Defense and Veterans Affairs Committee that even though this body has done numerous things to help out veterans and service members in this state, that this is still the number one issue that I hear people calling and asking for us to do something regarding. Mr. Chairman, I believe that is correct. I cannot tell you how all through the years, how often I hear from veterans or those that are looking at getting close to retiring, and they're very interested. They follow this, and they know which states are most military friendly. That's correct. That's correct. Further question? Yes, I yield. And many of those people that call their service members that are serving their sons and daughters of Georgia, but they're retiring from their service in another state, and they're wanting to move back home to be near their family that they grew up with. But it doesn't make economic sense for them to do so because the state that they're in, their or in other states, have this incentive. So this would encourage people who are retiring in other states to come back home or to move to Georgia to supply the workforce needs, not only keep, and also keep the ones that are retiring in our state to stay here since they know the missions that are already at the base that they're retiring at that many of those people will stay here too. So this will be a huge economic incentive for them and for the state of Georgia to get the workforce needs that it requires. I believe that would be true, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman, for this bill. Thank you. Do you continue to yield? Oh, Mr. Speaker, I believe I'll yield the way. I'm just going to give you a little guidance here. You have nine questions lined up. Okay, we have other members that wish to be heard on the bill too. Chair recognizes the Governor's four-liter representative bonner to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues. This morning I rise in support of House Bill 1064, and I know that so many of you support this measure as well. But I just want to take a quick opportunity to highlight the importance of this because this is one of those few instances in our legislative careers that we get to do something that is not only good, but we get to do something that is absolutely right. So many times during the course of my 24-year career as an Army officer, I'll be traveling in uniform out the community, airport, things like that. And inevitably, someone will come up to me and say, thank you for your service. That's a common refrain that we hear and that we give out to our service members. But this is an opportunity for us as a state, as a collective legislature to not only say thank you for your service, but to actually put something into motion that will actually think those.

for their service. This is an opportunity as Representative Petri mentioned, not only an issue of workforce development, but it's absolutely the right thing to do. This is also the culmination of years of work by members of our body to include Chairman Clark, Chairman Belton, Representative Williams, Dean Smirie, so many of those that have taken an interest in veterans affairs. This is Representative Petri mentioned, this is a key component of Governor Kim's agenda. So I thank the Governor for this, and I thank Speaker Rausten for giving this a priority that this bill deserves, and I would ask for your all favorable consideration. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Al Williams to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill for many reasons, but I could not speak without acknowledging that as far back as 2005, Chairman Smith introduced a bill to do this very same thing. It didn't go anywhere. Around 2000, I think it was a very important thing to do this very same thing. I think it was a very important thing that didn't go anywhere. Around 2010, Representative Glanton introduced a bill, did but do the same thing. It didn't go anywhere, but its time has come, and its way past doing them, so glad to see it introduced it now. At representing the largest percentage of military folk anywhere in the state, Liberty County and Fort Stewart, which certainly this is very, very important. Very important. We have generations now that have retired in Liberty County, and we certainly think that this will be an incentive to keep more people in Georgia. Now, I really think that it adds to a long list of reasons, because I'll be very honest with you. Be pretty tough to go to Alabama or South Carolina because they have attacked the doctor. I need a little more than that to reside there, but sure, somebody will get that after a while, Bruce. But I would certainly add this arrow to the quiver. It is important. It's important that these military people stay because some of the great minds have stayed in Liberty County after retiring in Liberty County, have stayed in Georgia. Great minds. That's why we have such a brain thrust, and I know it's difficult for many of you who live in areas and don't have the tight military participation I have, and your brain thrust has been a little strange. But if you want it help, you can come to Liberty County where we certainly have it. It's, I'm so glad to stand and probably support this bill because it certainly says that dreams deferred are not dreams denied. It's here now. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Are you the well? Thank you. Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip, representative Wilkerson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I come down to support House Bill 1064, and now I'm going to confuse everybody because I'm going to ask for one additional thing. I spoke to the author, and the bill excludes 17,500 in military retiree benefits, which is great. The second 17,500, you have to actually make over that to get anything at all. So I grew up in a community where my father was retired military and enlisted man, and he decided to go work as social worker. And a lot of those jobs don't pay over a certain amount. So if you're working part time with our kids, working part time in the schools, you may not make over 17,5. So under this bill, you don't get anything. So what I would ask is that we exclude income up to 17,500 in addition if you work. So it's kind of complicated, I know it's a tax thing. It took me a while to talk to all the CPAs, but basically what I'm asking for is this bill moves forward, is for us to exclude everything up to 17,500 that you earn in income. And I think that would make this a perfect bill because my neighbors have been asking for this. My father, if he was still here, would be telling me I need to vote for this. And all the retirees that I grew up in New Jersey, right outside the Fortis Army base, would be asking for this. So I support the bill. I'm gonna be voting enthusiastically, a green button on that bill on that board, but I'm asking that we exclude, change the bill to say instead of exceeds to say up to 17,500.

This bill I refer to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends the disbilled do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Bershitt to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I bring to you House Bill 1271. It's an easy bill and more importantly, it's a quick bill. What this bill does is it prohibits HOAs from not allowing a property owner or resident from displaying the American flag. There's already a federal law, the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act, but this is a law that we would in an act that would allow folks in the state to seek redress in the state courts. This is largely the same language as the federal law. With an addition, we put a floor on the size of American flag that can be displayed. In other words, we didn't want an HOA to say we're allowing someone to display a flag if they were only letting them display a very small flag. It's a four by six flag. Secondly, I want to point out to you that I know that the rule sheets does say Georgia and the United States flag. The earlier version was Georgia and the United States. This is just the United States flag. With that, I'm going to take questions or yield to will. You have a question if you care to yield. One question I yield. Chair recognizes Representative McLaren to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the chairman yield? Yes. Chairman, it seems to me to be a display of patriotism and in the interest of thoroughly vetting the bill and making sure all interests are represented. Did the committee give any consideration whatsoever to allow Georgia flag to have this same type of protection? I mean the University of Georgia with the G. We didn't take that in consideration, but I'd be amenable to certainly the House would, but we'd have to make that change in the Senate. Well, I guess it's a little loose over there. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Are you out of the well? Gentlemen, as you yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.

What purpose does representative Beth Moore rise? State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that I support this bill in part because I am also a co-sponsor of representative fries bill to prohibit age and ways from banning solar panels because solar panels are next to flags, one of the most patriotic things we can display on our homes as we transition to renewable energy to combat climate change. Sometimes these parliamentary inquiries get into some pretty good rhetoric. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring before you House Bill 1346 and before I tell you the what of the bill, I'm going to tell you the why of the bill. I have a daughter. She graduated from law school. She didn't like practicing so much so she went to work for the county clerk's office. There she is the chief county clerk in Cherokee County. But as the daughter of a retired veteran, she also wanted to be able to serve her country. Whenever she investigated the matter, she was found that she could not. Per Georgia code. There was a specific statement saying that clerks of court cannot practice law. Now we get into the what? This bill specifically allows for members who are attorneys to be able to practice in the Jaguar. And thanks to the thoroughness of our judiciary chair also includes space force. So she might actually go and be a Jaguar member for space force. But all the branches of the military are listed. Mr. Chairman, that's the bill. Supply's the at heart. And I'll be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our urgent favourable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

House Bill 1056 by Representative Hill of the Third and others to be entitled back to amend. Title 47, the official go to George Ante, relating to retirement and pensions. Those are repeal certain restrictions and requirements concerning the authority to make alternative investments with the Georgia Firefighters pension fund. This bill having referred to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Hill to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm sure a lot of us in here have family members who are firemen or associated with the firemen. This bill has the total support of the firefighters. It's not a physical bill. It allows them to take the alternative investments from 10% to 15%. That's basically all the bill does and it pertains only to the firemen. With that, Mr. Speaker, the day is long. My time is short and I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Voting aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does the minority leader rise? Parliamentary. What is the future inquiry? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that we're not aware of how much the amount of money that's going to go into this pension plan from 10% to 15% what that amount of money actually is? That's going to be assets on the management. Is that not true? I don't know what you were given or not given. We could try to answer that by parliamentary inquiry. Let's try this. What purpose does Chairman Carpenter rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The state you're inquiry. Basically, is it not true that this bill would just allow the investment pension fund to be able to invest 15% of their money into these alternative investment vehicles instead of 10% doesn't change money in or out. It just gives them another vehicle to invest that money. It's a more profitable if you will. Thank you for the inquiry, Mr. Speaker. I'm sorry. For the parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the assets under management under this new plan, we have not learned what those assets under management would be so it could be real estate, it could be debt, it could be a bunch of things but we don't know what those assets under management could be. And that was not explained fully in the bill. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? Let's take a shot at Chairman Martin or purpose to you rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that this fund has been able to invest in these for a number of years? Isn't that true? Is the gentleman so states I know that he is an expert in this area? That further true, Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman said when he presented the bill that this allows them to invest a maximum of 15% rather than the current cap of 10% in these funds. And isn't it further true that we have good people managing these funds overall and they would not do that if they did not think it was in the best interest of the people, the pensioners in the front find. The gentleman so states what purpose does Chairman Carson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, just in regard to what all the other Parliamentary inquiries have stated or inquired, this I believe that is true. Is it not true that this does raise not just the amount to 15% but that amount includes capital calls and to the leaders question. It also allows for the firefighters pension fund to invest particularly in private equity during a time where equity returns are not been fantastic recently. And we're in a period of inflationary returns whereas the bond returns fixed income are down. This gives the pensioners and the firefighters fund more flexibility under private equity. If the gentleman so states so what purpose does representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry. I just want to make sure that I'm getting this correct that these are the same funds. The same investments are going to be the same ones we're using for just increase in the 15% from 10% to 15% but it would be the same investment. That is my understanding. Yes. Thank you.

Thank you so much for this bill. I'm just curious why are we increasing the size? Well, I got interested in it because dental care is very scarce throughout. Not only rural Georgia, olive Georgia, and we need to increase the number of dentists. I had gotten a local dentist to donate his dental equipment when he was leaving and retiring. I worked with my fellow refunded health clinic to open up a dentist in his office. We can't find a dentist. Not enough dentists in the state. I'm sure you're aware that Emery dental school closed several years ago. We just have one dental school. I hope through this we will have more progressive ways of getting more dentists to come to Georgia in practice. Does the general lady further yield? Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify. We're increasing the size of the board in order to try to attract more dentists to Georgia. Well, I think we'll get some more progressive ideas, maybe. Thank you. No further questions.
