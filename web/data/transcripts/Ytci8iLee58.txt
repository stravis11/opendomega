Our chaplain this morning will be

briefly
by the gentleman from the 161st House
District, Representative Bill Hitchens.
>> Thank you, Madam Pro Tim. Uh I think I
appreciate that. uh
my my reputation is is uh it's going
gotten pretty widespread. I But it's an
honor for me today to to introduce an
old friend of mine. I've known him for
many many years. Uh I don't go to his
church, but we've interacted for for a
long time. And uh he's a very impressive
uh preacher and community activist. And
uh I'd also like to introduce his wife
Susie who is uh probably more active in
in our our county than uh than Don is,
but everywhere they go you see the two
of them together. Don's the pastor of
the Oak Grove Church of Christ where
he's been for 23 years. I knew him
previously when he was the pastor of a a
church in Fort Wentworth which is also
in my district and is adjacent to uh to
Effingham County.
One of the things I remember most, and
we were just talking about a little
while ago, he uh he was the little
league football coach of my son that
most of you know, 42 years ago, and uh
he said he was he was glad that he
didn't ruin him, but he ended up being
the uh started one game and uh his
freshman year and and was the starting
quarterback on our team for three years
and we played for the state championship
in the largest classification. So, I
think I owe I owe Don some appreciation,
but um the uh the Oak Grove Church of
Christ, you know, everything in
Effingham County generally is pretty
historical is the oldest continuous
meeting church of Christ in the United
States. So, uh, just a brief brief
history, but and he and his wife have
organized what they call Effingham's
Heroes, which is an organization that
supports all the public safety officers
in the county. It's been going on for
three, four, five years now. People in
the judiciary,
uh, law enforcement, uh, fire
departments, EM, EM, uh, everybody
belongs to it. And, uh, last year we had
the inaugural parade in in Springfield.
and I was fortunate enough to be named
the uh the grand marshal. So, I
appreciate it. He uh he's moved up to
Effingham County 23 years ago, but he's
he and his wife have woven uh themselves
into the fabric of our county and and we
really appreciate it. So, Don, thank you
very much.
>> Thank you, Representative Hitchens.
Thank you so much. and thank you for the
friendship over the years. Thank you for
the introduction. I appreciate the
office of Speaker John Burns and this
opportunity to to be here today. I'm
deeply honored to have this opportunity
to stand before you today in this
capacity. And I sincerely thank each of
you for the work that you do for our
state.
Philippians chapter 2:es 3 and 4 is
where we're going to read this morning.
And it reads as follows. Do nothing out
of selfish ambition or vain conceit.
Rather, in humility, value others above
yourselves. Not looking to your own
interest, but each of you to the
interest of others.
Selfish ambition
focuses on personal goals, often at the
expense of others. Vain conceit involves
an exaggerated view of oneself and one's
qualities leading to a lack of true
awareness.
Now, I remember as a young preacher on
occasion when I allowed Satan to
dominate my heart with these very traits
that we've just spoken of from that
verse. Not proud of it. A congregation
in our area where I lived at that time
invited a preacher to come and preach
revival services for them.
When I heard who it was, I could not
believe it. This man, as far as I was
concerned, had some real deep uh serious
theological issues and he needed to be
talked to. I decided what I would do. I
would go with my Bible and my pen and my
paper and I would keep a record of
everything he said that was wrong. I
would catch him and I would confront
him.
I basically at that time didn't believe
he could teach me anything because of
the area of disagreement I had with him.
So I attended the revival as I had
planned, pen and paper in hand, and I
waited and I waited and I waited
and I didn't have anything on my page.
Finally, about halfway through the
service, the Holy Spirit convicted my
heart about my selfish ambition and vain
conceit, and I began to listen to this
man speak that night from the book of
Hebrews.
And I've never heard anyone teach like
he talked. He opened my heart to one
beautiful truth after another. And when
I left the church that night, my paper
was full of ink.
But it wasn't of his errors. It was full
of the truths that this man had taught
me that night.
I vowed to God that night as I had
learned a lesson that I would never
again approach a service or a teacher or
anyone as I did that night. That from
then on I would listen to learn
not for something to disagree with. I
would not diminish or disrespect or
disregard the wisdom of someone just
because there was an area of
disagreement somewhere in our lives. I
would look for reasons to respect and
hear when someone was sincerely trying
to talk to me.
Susie and I appreciate this body so much
and others that are here today.
You have a tremendous responsibility as
you attempt to serve the citizens of our
state. You have so many voices vying for
your attention.
And we live in a time when everyone is
encouraged to disrespect and disregard
any ideas from anyone with whom there's
a disagreement.
May we remember the words of scripture
today, applying them to our own hearts
and our lives as we deal with others.
And may we remember the words of
scripture that encourage us to do unto
others
as we would have them do unto us. In
humility, may we value others above
ourselves, not looking at our own
interest, but each of us to the interest
of others. We will not always agree with
everyone, but with this approach, we can
build a spirit of mutual respect and
appreciation and genuine consideration
even in our disagreements.
Would you stand with me, please, as we
pray this morning?
And following the prayer, we will have
the pledge of allegiance. Precious
Father,
God of all creation, we bow before you
acknowledging that it is in you that we
live and move and have our being. We bow
before you this morning, Lord, to first
of all say thank you. Thank you for your
love, your mercy, and grace manifested
in so many ways every day in our lives.
Thank you for Jesus, our Lord and
Savior. And thank you for the blessing
of living in America and the blessing of
living in the state of Georgia. Thank
you for those you've raised up to serve
as leaders. Thank you for everyone from
the highest officials in our state to
those who serve in our local
communities. Lord, today we continue to
grieve for the life of yours and our
servant that was taken and mourn for his
family. Please hold this family close to
your heart in this time of loss. We ask
for healing for your servant who was
injured and just please place a hedge of
protection around all of our first
responders.
Thank you for those who selfishly served
our state over the weekend to make it
possible for us to get out and about and
to protect us from the dangers incurred
by the weather. Lord, especially today,
will you bless with your presence, your
wisdom, and guidance those of this
chamber as they consider the important
matters before them. Open their minds
for the discernment needed to make not
just good decisions, Father, but the
best decisions for the well-being of our
state now and the years to come. Thank
you for the work in progress that has
been done. You've been so good to us,
Lord. Thank you for that which is
presently being done in our state. We
thank you for the blessings of
opportunity this brings for families and
citizens across our state for the
future. And now Lord, may the words of
your servant David and our savior Jesus
when they said, "Father, into your hands
I commit my spirit be the sentiments of
our own hearts today in everything for
your glory and honor and praise in Jesus
name." Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the
stand
with liberty and justice for all.

members, we will move on to morning
orders. We have a lot of good friends in
the gallery and members that want to uh
recognize them. So, hope you be
courteous and come to your seats.
See some I can tell I can read lips. I
see some very important conversations
going on. So if you'll take those
conversations to the any room that would
be I would be very grateful.
Members, please take your seat
and give the gentleman who's about to
enter the well your attention.
We'll start with Representative Al
Williams for a twominut
morning order and then we'll take the
other morning orders and you'll have
about a minute minute and a half to
recognize your visitors. Minute minute
and a half. That's minute and a half is
90 seconds if you're slow on math. So
that's what that is. So Representative
Williams is recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You sound like a
preacher when I'm getting ready to speak
at a funeral. two minutes and I forgot
my
>> not possible.
>> Had the seat. Not possible.
I rise this morning for a moment in
black history that's very personal. On
your desk, I was glad to see today's
Rosa Parks Day and there is a reception
going on from 9 until 12. It's a very
personal moment. When I was in the ninth
grade, I met Rosa Parks.
The only people that doesn't like that
is a leader in state form. But my age
has caught me.
But to meet Rosa Parks was an
experience.
He was one of the gentle She was one of
the gentle souls of the civil rights
movement. Softspoken,
full of wisdom.
But sitting with her was a lady who was
truly the mother of the civil rights
movement.
And to sit and listen to this wisdom.
And we documented a lot of this in a
documentary
that has been done called
Dorchester Academy
Liberty.
And it documents Andrew Young's work at
Dorchester Academy where he the first
real job he had in the civil rights
movement was in Liberty County and going
down there and meeting Rosa Parks,
meeting Miss September Clark, who was a
mother of the civil rights movement.
Meeting name people that would one day
be household names. Jesse Jackson when
the only thing I recognized was his
afro.
John Lewis,
Fanlu Hmer, the greats of the civil
rights movement came through Dorchester
Academy. If you're ever in Liberty
County on your way to heaven, you may
join, come by and see Dorchester Academy
where the legend of the civil rights
movement where the Birmingham movement
was planned. I had a very rare seat to
listening to the planning, but the
history comes alive at Dorchester. And I
invite you to look at the documentary on
Dorchester that was produced
by K. Flowers Johnson. She used to be an
anchorwoman for Channel 11. She's done
an excellent job. This tells a seldom
told story about this fantastic place
that was once a school started in 1871
ended up the school that trained over
10,000 people in community organization
and qualifying people to run to go home
and register to vote all over the south.
That's my moment in black history.
>> Thank you, Representative Williams. I
didn't know about Doorchester so much.
I've heard you mention it before, but we
all know that a story seldom told is
soon forgotten, right? So, let's tell
the story.
Chairman McDonald and Representative
Scoffield recognized for a morning order
and some recognitions, I believe, and
some other friends. Chairman McDonald.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, the house, today is
firefighter appreciation day. Many of
you have volunteers in your community
and many of you have full-time. So, this
is an annual thing we do here to
recognize firefighters. I think a lot of
them are in the governor's office right
now uh having a a photo op. But we have
over 30,000 firemen in the state of
Georgia with 900 fire departments. This
this is in each and every one of your
communities. So, you'll see them around
today. Thank them for what they do. do
the sacrifice that they make from from
their families and and waking up at all
hours of night serving our communities.
Uh so today, February 3rd, 2026, is
Georgia Firefighter Appreciation Day.
>> Thank you. I get a chance to brag on all
firefighters. Members of the house, join
me in welcoming Atlanta Fire Chief
Rodrik Smith and the members of the
Atlanta Fire Rescue and Foundation as we
honor and recognize Firefighter Day at
the Capitol. We thank Chief Smith for
over 30 years of dedication particularly
in the city of Atlanta and for the
countless hours that he's given. He's a
proud Georgian and he has led the brave
men and women in the fire Atlanta fire
rescue department. As a result, it is my
distinct honor to recognize Chief Smith
for his years of dedication service to
our state as outstanding Georgia citizen
and award uh the highest award presented
by the Secretary of State. And I also
want to thank Teaos Win for your
contributions for the Atlanta Fire
Foundation. Join us at 2 216 upon

us recognize you.
I yield a well. Thank you.

Let's see. She has some friends. man
Blackman, Lumston, and Bart Barton and
Hitchens,
please come join the chair lady in the
well, if you will. Gentlemen,
>> thank you, Mr. Speaker. As we honor all
firefighters, particularly this morning,
one is on my heart and on my friends
behind me as well. We were privileged to
know Chief Gordon Henderson. He lived a
life of dedication and service. He
passed away this past fall at the young
age of 75.
Very young.
His legacy of service spanned nearly
five decades. He was a native of the
Georgia model community which is in
Rome, a veteran of the Rome fly fire
department
uh and steadily rose through the ranks
since 1975
to earn many awards, honors and
distinctions through that time. When he
stepped away with retirement in 2015, he
continued to serve our state in many
ways. Over the years, he served as
president of the Georgia State
Firefighters Association, the district
vice president for the Georgia
Association of Fire Chiefs, and multiple
leadership roles within the National
Fire Protection Association.
Chief Henderson continued to serve
statewide as the executive director of
the Georgia Firefighter Standards and
Training Council, a role which he
fulfilled until 2022.
He ensured the compliance and
regulations and collaboration that
continue with all of the firefighters
that we see in each of our comm
communities today. I would ask y'all to
please stand. His family members and
dear friends are with us, particularly
executive director Randy Toms, who is
recognizing his legacy. Our own current
Rome Floyd fire chief Troy Brock, Jason
Brownlow, Christian Tiffan, and his
widow, Mrs. Dawn Henderson, please stand
and let us recognize you and thank you.
Condolences to the family. A life
well-lived and well served sounds like
to me. And to all of our fire
professionals, thank you so much. and
it's great having y'all here in the
people's house. Thank you, Chair Lady
Dempsey.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the
well.
>> Representative Beckals.
>> Ladies recognized for a morning order.
Do you have some friends coming with
you?
>> We'll also allow them to join you as
well.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
>> Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to
recognize a pillar of faith and
community service, the Harvest
Tabernacle Church, as they celebrate
their 25th anniversary. For a quarter of
a century, under the visionary
leadership of Pastor Travis and
Stephanie Jennings, the Harvest
Tabernacle has been more than a house of
worship. It has been a beacon of hope
and transformation in our community.
Since 1999, this church has faithfully
served through food pantries, which has
fed hundreds of families.
Their commitment extend beyond Sunday
services. From homelessness outreach to
community cookouts, from nurturing young
lives through children's ministry to
uplifting families in crisis, the
Harvest Tabernacle embodies the
principle of service beyond self. Mr.
Speaker, as we honor their 25th years of
faithful service, I ask this body to
recognize Pastor Travis and Stephanie
Denis. Could you please stand?
>> Thank you.
>> Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
>> Thank you, Representative Beckles. Thank
you for your service and welcome to the
people's house. We appreciate what
you've been doing and what you will do
as well. Thank you so much.
Chairman Hitchens,
do you have a morning order?
You want me to call on someone else
first? You want me to call someone else
first?
I mean, you don't have to speak if you
don't want to. I can assure you of that.
And because you know, do we do have a 90
second time limit?
>> Absolutely. Chairman Hitchens is
recognized. I was supposed to do this
yesterday, but the people who uh who
were supposed to be in the gallery
weren't weren't here. So, uh yesterday
was Effingham day at the Capitol. All
our folks, the speaker and my folks were
uh were here, but they were at a DOT
meeting. Uh Effingham County is the one
of the original eight counties in
Georgia, founded in actually the
Salsburgers landed there in 1731
and it was incorporated into the United
States in 1777.
Uh, our first governor of the state of
Georgia, not under English rule, was
John Adam Troutland, who was a uh, an
indentured servant that came from
Saltsburg, Austria, and worked his way
up through the legislature to be to be
our first governor who was later
assassinated by the Tories after the
Revolutionary War. So, there's a lot of
history in Effingham County. You heard
me uh, speak to the uh, chaplain of the
day. Everything there is old, including
myself and the speaker. But, uh,
do we have some of the folks from
Effingham County here?
There we No, they're leaving.
So, I appreciate everybody turned out
last night for the reception. We had a
great reception. A lot of lot of
representatives showed up and uh we're
very appreciative.
>> Minute and a half.
>> You You made it. Time to spare. Thank
you, Chairman Hitchens. We're always
glad to have home folks. I know all the
other members are as well when they come
up and and visit us here as we work. We
appreciate our folks from Effingham
County.

town?
Junction City. Y'all know where that is.
That's where she's from. Represent
Bogner.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, there are a
number of us here today that are wearing
green because we used to have different
little uniforms that were green because
we were Girl Scouts. Today's Girl Scout
Day in the Capitol and we have some Girl
Scouts upstairs.
So, I'm joined by Girl Scouts that prove
that the leadership programs in Girl
Scouts work or we wouldn't be here.
>> That's right.
>> That's right. The other great thing
about Girl Scouts is it started right
here in Georgia in Savannah with Juliet
Gordon Low in 1912. So, it's over a
hundred years old. And she did something
very unique at the time by reaching
across class, cultural, and eth ethnic
boundaries to ensure that all girls,
including those with disabilities, had a
place to grow and develop their talents
and leadership skills. She is to be
commended for her vision, and we are
excited to have girls,
43,000
Georgia girls in the program. learning,
growing, and becoming strong. If Will
will the girls in the Girl Scouts in the
gallery that aren't already standing,
stand up so we can recognize them. And
welcome to your house.
So when you enjoy your cookies, think of
them.

>> Lady yield for a question.

say she was from?
>> Savannah.
>> I thought you said Atlanta. I beg your
pardon.
>> I'm Savannah.
>> I'll listen more intently next time.

>> Mr. Cler, will you read the caption to
House Bill 350?
House Bill 350 by Representative Cameron
of the first and others to be entitled
act to amend title 19. The official code
of Georgia annotated relating domestic
relations so as to provide provisions
relative to safe places for newborns.
This bill I'm referred to committee on
public safety and homeland security.
That committee recommends that this bill
do pass.
Representative Mike Cameron. You ready
to go? Give the gentleman the well your
attention, please. Representative
Cameron.
>> Good morning, Mr. Speaker, and thank you
for the time. I bring today HP 350. This
bill will allow the uh installation of
infant safety devices in the state of
Georgia. An infant safety device is
something where like a fireh hall or a a
police station, an ambulance service or
even a medical facility can place a uh
device where a child can be surrendered
and uh safely surrendered where uh
someone will pick that up and and take
them uh to medical facility or somewhere
else. Um this is not a new concept in
Europe for hundreds of years. They've
had uh devices called hatch hatches. And
in Poland, they have something called
the window of life, which is a box that
has a window in the front of it. And
when someone sees a baby, they tell the
priest or they tell the nun or someone
at a church, they go get the b the baby
out. Now, how this process works is a
newborn can be surrendered at say a
fireh hall. When they open the the front
door of this device, they place the baby
inside. It's like almost like an
incubator. They close the box. An alarm
goes off silently inside the fireh hall.
Uh then someone comes, they out of the
back side of the device, they take the
the newborn out. Then the process is to
take the newborn to a medical facility
to be checked out, usually with EMS.
When the
child gets to the hospital, they notify
human services. They check the baby out
and once the the baby is uh deemed to be
safe and okay, then within six hours,
the Department of Human Services picks
the baby up and places them in care.
That way, we get them in a safe place
where they'll be there. Uh, one question
that's come up is what happens if say a
fire department in a real community will
uh right on a call and the alarm goes
off. The bill uh states that that that
alarm has to go off to someone else like
a EMS or 911 center so someone knows
that child is in there. So then someone
can come and and take the baby out.
There's also another alarm that monitors
the inside of the box all day long to to
see if there's any activity. Plus, the
act also requires twice a day that uh
firemen or the police department,
whoever, goes in, monitors, and checks
to see if everything's okay. Once a
month, both alarms have to be checked
and verified to make sure they work. So,
it's a safe way if someone makes a
decision to surrender a child, they can
do it this way and know that there are
people there that are going to take care
of the child and move the child through
a process of safety to get them
somewhere where maybe they can have a
better life. So, that's the whole idea
where we're not dropping babies in
discriminant places, you know, those
kind of things that's happened before.
So, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill in
general. I'll be glad to answer any
questions.
Gentleman yield for a question?
>> Yes, sir.
>> Representative Scoffield is recognized
for a question. Represent Scoffield to
your right.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does a gentleman
yield?
>> I yield.
>> I just want to say that this is this not
a good bill?
>> I believe it's a great bill. It's an
opportunity to offer something to
someone when they surrender a child. And
I as a man I can't imagine the pain that
when you come to that decision of
surrendering a child for whatever reason
but you know if it goes in here there's
a process and the child will be safe and
it'll be taken care of.
>> Does gentleman further yield?
>> Yes ma'am.
>> I look forward to voting yes on this
bill. Can you expand that so that I can
put legislator in the box like this one
right over here and leave her somewhere?
Thank you. Mr. We had to change the age
requirement back to that.
>> Gentleman further yield.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Representative Holly to your left
back is recognized for a question.
>> Good morning.
>> Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Uh, thank you for bringing this bill,
sir. Uh, I was wondering u this I was
believing when you reading through this
it brought to mind of that case of
Justin uh Ross Harris who intentionally
unfortunately left his child uh in the
car. Uh and then but I think you know
certainly this bill looks at the fact
that fathers too might be able to be
spared should their child be over under
the age of 30. uh is that true even
though the statute doesn't necessarily
uh does not have specify in terms of the
sex of the parent
>> doesn't specify but I believe
>> okay thank you sir I believe this is an
excellent bill thank you
>> thank you
>> representative Rice to your left is
recognized for a question
>> thank you Mr. Speaker, do you yield?
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Is it not true that in addition to
giving the the option of life to a
mother that's potentially in a crisis
pregnancy, there's also what this
affords is when a mother or father has a
child that might be in danger due to
substance abuse or abuse in the home, it
gives a safe alternative for that child
to grow up safe in a happy life that
that that parent desires.
>> You're exactly right. And I was thinking
to mind last year we had two members who
families had babies. Those babies are
going to be loved and and taken care of.
But for children that aren't, this gives
an opportunity to get those children in
a position where they can find hopefully
a forever family. And I think of
representative Hud, former
Representative Hutcherson that used to
show children on the screen that needed
to be adopted. We find a place for a
child like that and where they'll be
safe and they'll be nurtured. So yes.
Thank you.
Representative Glaze
is recognized for a question. Your left
again.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is it not true
that the saving lives of babies is the
probably the most heavenly thing that we
can do in this session?
>> Oh, I think so. And you know, one of
these children may grow up and end up in
this legislature. So, you never know.
Um, we're giving we're giving children a
chance to grow up and become everything
they can be. So,
>> is it not also not true that as a mother
and a grandmother, I stand firmly with
this bill and can't wait to vote it up.
>> I know you do. Thank you for your help.
>> Representative Hitchens, Chairman
Hitchens, recognized for a question to
your left again.
>> Gentlemen, yield.
>> Yes, sir. One of the concepts of this
whole program was to begin with was
anonymity. Uh all those facilities that
you named off typically have uh video
camera security. Is there any guarantee
that they won't be videoed and then at a
later time identified in some fashion?
>> Well, the statute says they can do it
anonymously. If they wish to get their
name, they can, but they don't have to.
And uh what happened I live most people
know I live on the border of Tennessee.
Like if I could hit a 60°ree wedge
straight, it would be probably 60 70 ft.
Yeah. But uh Chattanooga has one in a
fireh hall and last March uh after we
discussed this bill with the speaker um
that night a child was surrendered and
successfully taken to a medical
facility. Now that child's in a in a
family, so it's a good process.
>> Gentleman has no further questions. Did
we pass this bill last year? Is that
what you said?
>> We passed it as part of another bill
which I want to thank Representative
Clark for doing that.
>> But we perfected it.
>> We have no further questions.
>> Okay. Thank you. And thank you to
Representative or Chairman Crow for your
help on this. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
yield the well.
>> Gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered. Is any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Hearing none, the
report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote
yes. All those opposed will vote no. And
Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
All members voted.
All members voted.
If so,
Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On
the passage of House Bill 350, the yays
are 168. The nays are zero. The bill
having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed.
Congratulations.
members. Former Representative Angela
Couch, where are you? There she is in
the back. Let's make her welcome.
Welcome back to the people's house,
Representative Couch.
Representative
Baker,
come back up if you don't mind.
Members, we have a couple other bills we
want to take up, but we want to we'd
like to recognize someone first.
So members, our doctor of the day today
belongs to one of our house members,
uh, Senator, excuse me, Representative
Sylvia Wafer Baker.
I demoted you to senator there for a
second. And, um, you won't take that.
You going to stay with us. Uh, this is
Dr. Stiglets. We are we are so grateful
for you being here. Thank you for your
service. She's a doctor with the
WellStar organization. We appreciate her
service. Thank you for being here to
service. Thank you very much. Let's give
her a hand.
I didn't say it then. She is her
daughter. Y'all thought she was her
sister. I know that.
Her daughter. I apologize. Thank you so
much.
>> Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to
House Bill 946?
House Bill 946 by Representative Clifton
of the 131st and others be titled an act
to amend title 27 of the official code
of Georgia annotated relating to game
and fish so as to authorize hunting and
trapping of feral hogs under certain
circumstances. This bill haven't been
assigned to the committee on game, fish,
and parks. That committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
Representative Clifton is recognized to
present the bill.
We appreciate your work on this. It's an
important issue. Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll give the member in the well
your attention, please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have here
before you today House Bill 946, which
will provide hunters and land owners
with more tools to remove invasive,
destructive feral hogs from Georgia's
landscape. We already have several state
programs and initiatives working to
tackle this problem, but we are as
elected officials have the opportunity
to remove statutory burdens currently in
place. I have worked with our team at
DNR and have their support on these
efforts. House Bill 946 would remove the
following burden barriers, therefore
helping to remove even more of these
invasive animals. Section one of the
bill would allow residents and
non-residents to trap and kill feral
hogs without a hunting or trapping
license. As you can see up here, that's
a picture of a feral hog and one of
these invasive uh species we're trying
to help diminish a little. Uh section
two removes the wildlife control permit
related to taking of any feral hogs. And
finally, section three does two things.
First, it would legalize the hunting of
hogs on private property from a motor
vehicle without the need of someone to
acquire a wildlife control permit from
DNR. Currently, the law prohibits the
feral the hunting of feral hogs from
motor vehicles unless a wildlife control
permit has been issued. Second, it will
allow the use of unmanned aircraft
systems or drones to locate feral hogs.
We're not killing them with drones.
We're just using them to locate and find
them. And based on the existent statute,
it is currently unlawful to use an
aircraft to hunt feral hogs. The
language uh is included on line 47
through 49 and would explicitly allow
unmanned aircraft system used to locate
feral hogs on private property.
Uh if you could go to the next picture,
that is a typical um area that hogs have
gotten in and uh destroyed agriculture,
which is another reason this bill is
very important. With that, Mr. Speaker,
I will entertain any questions.
>> You have a couple of questions. To your
right, Representative Chaz Cannon is
recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes, sir. Is it not true that damage
occurring on farms throughout Georgia
from hogs is about $150 million
annually?
>> Yes, sir. That is correct.
>> The gentleman further yield.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Is it not true that this is being done
in on some places already, but this just
further codifies it in the law?
>> Yes, sir. That's correct.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
>> Gentleman has a couple other questions.
Rep. Representative Thomas to your
right. This is recognized for a
question.
>> Thank you. Do you yield?
>> Yes, sir.
>> I'm just curious. Is this any way going
to affect the wild hog supper?
>> We might have a little bit more uh
barbecue if we can get this thing
through.
>> Well, thank you. In that case, I'll
support the bill.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Chairman Petri to your left is
recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman
yield?
>> Yes, sir. Is it not true representative
that not only is this species invasive
to the North American continent,
destructive of agriculture, but also of
native wildlife and native species such
as quail nest, turkey nest, etc.
>> Absolutely. And just to add, the feral
hogs uh can reproduce, I believe, two
sometimes three times a year and have um
a litter of piglets up to about 18. So
once hogs are in your area, it is almost
impossible to get rid of them. So again,
this measure is to help keep the
population down so they do not destroy
property and to your point, uh,
wildlife.
>> Representative Reese to your left in the
back is recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes, sir. Isn't it true that these hogs
are actually causing millions of dollars
in damage to our farming industry here
in Georgia and can damage acres just
within a nighttime span?
>> Yes, sir. As of 2020, UG uh extension um
estimated about $150 million in damages.
And
>> and isn't it further true that many of
our farmers in the rural parts of our
state just don't have the capacity to
fence off their entire properties? But
these hogs are causing a huge issue as
well as the deer too that I'm hearing
from some farmers. I know we're just
dealing with hogs today, but the deer
are also causing a major issue for our
farmers and and the pro products that
they yield.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Thank you.
>> Chairman Dicki, he should know a little
bit about this subject matter. Let's see
what he knows. He has a question.
Chairman Dick,
>> uh, does gentleman yell?
>> Yes, sir. not only agricultural crops,
but I think it's known that they will uh
damage and um our sea turtle nests if
they're on the coast in those
situations. So, uh a very destructive
animal.
>> Absolutely.
>> Representative Ostein and then one more.
Representative Ostein is recognized for
a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman yield?
>> Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that my
family farms many, many, many acres and
they destroy our family farm every
single year?
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Is it not true that it is costing us a
fortune every year to get people to come
and kill these things for us?
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> I look forward to supporting the bill.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
>> To your left, Representative Donahoo is
recognized for a question.
>> You, Mr. Speaker, is this not true? Does
a gentleman yield?
>> Yes, sir. Is it not true that this will
not affect Wilbur, our friend in
Charlotte's Web?
>> This is for feral hogs only, not hogs
that are pets or farm raised.
>> Thank you for bringing the bill. It's a
great bill.
>> Thank you.
>> Gentleman has no further questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well
and ask for your favorable
consideration.
Just to follow up on Chairman Dickiy's
question and that answer uh all of our
friends from the coast realize how
destructive these uh predators are on
our sea turtle nest. Also island is one
of our most prolific
uh sea islands that um
produces as provides a spot for sea
turtles to nest. And there is a there
are a real problem y'all.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the
committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the passage of
the bill, we'll vote yes. All those
opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,
will you unlock the machine?
Have all members voted?
>> All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine
on the passage of House Bill 946?
The yays are 1663.
The nays are one. The bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Cler, will you read the caption of
House Bill 999?
House Bill 9999 by Representative Lever
to the 123rd and others to be entitled
and act to amend article 5 of chapter 10
of title 15 of the official code of
Georgia annotated relating the fees and
costs of magistrate courts so as to
revise provisions related to magistrate
courts collecting sums and fees
authorized by law. This bill referred to
the committee on judiciary that
committee recommends this bill do pass.
Chairman Levit, who comes from where all
that granite is, is recognized to
present the bill. Chairman Libert.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the House, uh, House Bill
999 is one of these exciting high
voltage bills for which I have become
known to present to you. Um, it does two
things. It it impacts our magistrate
courts. First of all, it allows
magistrate courts to assess fees in
addition to what they can collect by
statute if they're authorized by local
law, by local act of the general
assembly. A number of courts already do
that, but in the opinion of legislative
counsel, as one of my clients once said
to me, you had a big rat rod, it ain't
exactly le um so that is their opinion.
I know a lot of us have it, but this
bill would would fix it. Basically, it
would render that if as long as there's
a local act, it would render technology
fees and that sort of thing legal. It
would also allow courts in the future to
do it. It this arose for me personally
because one of my magistrate judges
wanted to assess such a fee. Um, so it
would do that and I would I would keep
in mind I know many of us don't like
additional fees, but this is a fee that
the court can assess and and basically
collect the revenue to fund their
technology needs through the people who
were before the the court rather than uh
put that burden on county taxpayers.
Second, the bill fixes a repealer
uh from House Bill 426, Representative
News bill last year which passed this
house that would make probate judges and
magistrate judges n nonpartisan
positions. The issue is in that bill,
probate judges are constitutional
officers. So, making them nonpartisan
had to be approved or ratified at at a
constitutional referendum. There's a
resolution, I think, currently uh
pending that that hopefully will reach
the floor at some point that would
authorize that referendum.
problem is in the bill it it normally it
when we when we have a constitutional
referendum we put in the bill enacting
something that's subject to a referendum
repealer language. So if the if the
referendum does not pass then whatever
we did in that bill is repealed. The
problem was with House Bill 426 there
was a little typo in there and it
repealed the whole thing. The part on
magistrate judges as well as the part on
probate judges if the referendum that
just applied to probate judges didn't
pass. So we fixed that with this bill.
We're we're revising that act so that
the repealer applies only to the parts
about probate judges if the referendum
does not pass. So, I hope you all were
able to contain yourselves in that
exciting presentation. Mr. Speaker, I'm
happy to stand for any questions.
>> Yes. Um, if you'll yield, Representative
Jason Ridley and I have a question. I'm
going to recognize Jason Ridley for the
question though.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, gentlemen,
yield.
>> Absolutely. this uh charge that's on
here. I know there was um a new program
they was trying to implement at some uh
courouses and then they was trying to do
it all over the state and I know some
judges came up here and talked to me
about that that they'd want to
implement. This don't have anything to
do with that.
>> To my knowledge it does not. This is
simply about a technology fee within the
magist court system to keep
>> I don't get nervous a lot but when a
attorney tells me to my knowledge no I
kind of have to question that.
Well, I'll handle it the representative
would. Absolutely not.
>> Oh, thank you, sir.
>> I am absolutely positive. Anyone
involved?
>> My sentiment's exactly, Representative
Ridley. The gentleman has no further
questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the House, I leave you with
this final thought. If I had a nickel
for every math exam I'd fail, I'd have
$11.23 now. Thank you.
I can't top that one.
>> Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none,
the previous question is ordered. Is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the
committee has agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All those in favor of the
passage of the bill will vote yes. All
those opposed will vote no. And Mr.
Alert. Will you unlock the machine?
Have all members voted?
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine?
On the passage of House Bill 999,
the yays are a 160, the nays are four.
The bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed.
That completes our rules calendar.
We have some afternoon orders. You will
have up to two minutes for your
afternoon order. Up to two minutes.
Representative Prince, Representative
Richardson,

Chairman Prince,
Augusta delegation, make your way down.

>> Bet we will be.
>> Thank you. And we are proud to recognize
and welcome all of the Augusta folks to
the capitol
and thanks for all you do for our state
from healthc care to entertainment,
sports. It's um a lot of things good
good things going on in that area.
Represent Scoffield recognized for an
afternoon order.
How about let's representative
Williams. I don't see Representative
Scoffield right now. Representative Al
Williams is recognized for an afternoon
order.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I got closer
because it's so cold in here right now.
My bones wasn't working.
Hint hint.
I rise
to mention a a a committee that I served
on this past year, the select insurance
committee headed by Representative Matt
Reeves. It was a great committee. I
thought it did great work and hats off
to the chairman who I thought was very
fair throughout the process.
My rising is very personal. We were told
by one of the major insurance companies,
the largest
in this country
about decreasing rates. We had no major
catastrophes last year in Georgia.
And
for some reason,
to my surprise, after being promised a
rate increase, not personally, but
overall,
I got my bill a few days ago, and my
bill went up $727
a year.
That's the exact reverse of what I
thought. But in addition, from a
non-personal standpoint, there are too
many small businesses in Georgia,
particularly body shops
that are just mistreated by
reimbursement rates by our insurance
companies. When you get ready to fix a
car now and you might have just knocked
the tail light out, but it's so integral
until if you affect any electronics, it
becomes a major job. And many times
these insurance companies will only
reimburse the body shop 50% of the cost.
Now I feel real sorry for these little
broke companies that only pay their
bosses about $50 million a year. I my
heart bleeds for them. But time out. We
did something about how they were
treating independent pharmacies in
Georgia a few years ago. It's time to
look into how they're treating
independent business people on ind on
reimbursement rates. And ain't nothing
wrong with getting old. So don't tell me
you raise my rate without telling me.
It's because I might limp a little bit.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I
yield the well.
>> Thank you, uh, represent. Thanks to that
committee and thanks for your service on
that committee. On that serious note, on
a not so serious note, Representative
Williams, you've heard of you've heard
of global warming.
We're trying to make sure we can take
care of it. Gets hot in here. So, we
turned the air conditioner down this
morning to take care of that. It's a
test. I think it's working well.
Representative Scoffield.
>> Okay.
Representee Ali.
Good afternoon, members of this house.
Mr. Speaker, thank you for the
opportunity to continue the trai the
tradition from my predecessor. Uh,
please give your attention to the screen
where 13-year-old Riley is. Riley is
available for adoption, but she is more
than just that fact. She is kind. She's
a cheerleader, an athlete, a grade A
student, and a true friend to those
around her. And as you all know by now,
it's my turn now.Hs.jah.gov
is where you can make a difference in
not just Riley's life, but so many other
children up available for adoption.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you, sir. Thanks for carrying on
the tradition. Representative Ford and
Representative Howard recognized for an
afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh on behalf of
the Georgia Aggra Business Council,
Representative Ford, myself would like
to invite everyone to join us this

Rep. Representative Acoy,
Representative Gabe Acoy. He knows a
little bit about a little bit about
engineering. So, uh, give the gentleman
your attention, please. Representative.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, you
introduce it say stand up.
>> Okay, hold on. On top of this. All
right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You
actually introduced me correctly. He
says I know a little bit about
engineering
a lot. But I am here to thank Mr.
Speaker cuz the other day I went to the
uh restroom.
I was shocked.
Ladies, I didn't go to yours, but I
think the speaker cannot be
discriminating. I I'm sure he did the
same thing that he did in the man's room
to your rooms, but he looked great.
He looked If you believe he looked
great, stop nodding your head and give
him a round of applause.
So we recognize people every day here,
but we fail to recognize when one of us
does something that is commendable. Mr.
Speaker, you are recognized and
commended. Thank you very much.
>> Thank you, Representative. But give all
the credit to Georgia Building
Authority. Gerald and his crew did a
great job on this building.
