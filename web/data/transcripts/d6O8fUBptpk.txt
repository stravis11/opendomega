TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you, Audrey.
And we look forward to enhancing your work and your passion.
And that's literacy in our state.
This house is committed to that.
And we look forward to working with you on that.
So thank you.
We're going to do something up special.
If we're going to take a quick couple photos up here,
and then we're going to move into something else.
So if you're remaining in your seats,
maybe with a little bit of conversation,
we'll move right along.
The House will come back to order, please.
Members, please return to your seats.
We have one more, one more, special recognition this morning, one more special recognition.
We need to thank the folks who are responsible for what we see in this chamber.
It's incredible work that's been done to bring this chamber and this building back to
much of his grandeur that when everything was newly minted here, if you will.
So I've invited a gentleman that was a critical piece of everything he was done here during
his entire work over the last year.
And that's Mr. Gerald, excuse me, Pilgrim, Deputy Executive Director and Chief of Staff.
I hope you get paid for both of those.
With the Georgia Bill Authority, Executive Director Smith, I know you're taking care of him
on both of those titles.
It's good to have Marty Smith here as well with George GBA.
You probably noticed this people's house is looking a little bit brighter today and every
essence of that word and that's because of Gerald Pilgrim in this team at GBA.
If you'll all look back and remember just a few months ago this chamber was covered in
scaffolding from talk about a many of you visited here.
The chamber was with Gerald and his team, you know, things are about getting done, kind
of like what we're doing in the house.
We have a job, but we get it done.
Gerald and his team had a job to get us back in this chamber on time with the work completed
and guess what?
No guesswork.
He got it done.
Thank you, Gerald.
Thanks for your team.
guess what else he did? He did it on the budget. Yeah. I thought that deserved a round
of applause as well, Gerald. Thanks for that. But if you will, all join me in thanking Gerald
and his entire team from the Georgia Building Authority who works so hard to make this
space, all that it is, all that it has been, so all Georgians can be proud of it.
I know y'all are, and I'm certainly proud of this chamber.
Gerald has prepared a video for us that speaks and shows us, reminds us of the work that
was done here, and how fast-paced it was, and then he's going to make some comments
and introduce some folks, I think, as well.
So with that, are we ready for the video?
We'll play the video afterwards.
Video afterwards.
Well, Gerald, then I'm going to welcome you here
to this microphone.
Share with us.
And Mr. Speaker, we did get the word.
We are going to work on the sale, too.
We've had some people already.
So if that's the only hiccup we got today,
we're doing well.
I really wish you wouldn't have shared that about the budget.
Chairman Hatch is already making notes over there.
And we still got a long way to go, Chairman.
So please, let's hold off on, take anything back yet.
So, but at first I would like to acknowledge Marty Smith, the State Property Officer, and
the entire just-ficking GBA team.
So not only is it just big, I have just GBA and SPC, but they only paid me one salary,
Jim, Mr. Speaker.
So, that's it.
But you're represented today by, with Marty, Gifton Pazley, Charlie Parrish, Chris Blackburn,
and then the project manager on this team's Sebastian Cobb.
So thank you all.
In addition, we have a construction team, and that word gets used a lot, but this is
a true team.
They take pride in ownership in this project and we're very proud to have them here.
That team was led by Mike Makin with Balfour Beatty and his staff, such in Salandra with
SG Contracting and his staff, Sean Moxley with Garbit Construction and his staff.
So what a wonderful job in there, the primary reason we're in here right now like this.
The architectural and engineering team was phenomenal on this project, a huge team effort
that started probably two days after we knew the budget was passed.
We started working on this project, securing the team, getting people going on that.
Representing the architectural and engineering team led by Lamar Wakefield and Henry Kent
Well, with Nelson Worldwide, Debbie Fritz, and the excellent interior designer, Robin
Kirkman, with Paige Now-Stantec, and a host of other preservationals, including representatives
from Conway Noens, Sheer Structural, Farmsworth Group, Action Electric, specialty wood works,
Carrollton Office Equipment in OFS,
JC Lane Mechanical, Benise Dowling,
Stilltech, Nehemiah 101,
John Canning, which was the Painting Contractor,
for all their nonstop work.
I also want to do a special acknowledgement
for a former teammate, David Goodhead,
who helped us organize and got the team go
and set up, we set us up for success.
So I'd like to personally thank them.
This team represents over 500 employees that worked on this project and over 400,000 man hours
preparing and executing this project.
Few facts about the project.
Speaker, you alluded to this a moment ago, but this is the first time in the history of
the Capitol that we were using American-made carpet and more importantly, Georgia-made
carpet from Dalton, Georgia.
The HVAC system that was here was replaced in the late 1950s.
So I think you're going to have a lot cleaner air.
Not only were there 400,000 of 400,000 man hours of work on this job, they were all injury-free
except for a few feelings.
If you know, you know.
When the scaffolding was erected,
there was 110,000 pounds of steel
used on the house floor alone.
And there's 120,000 feet of wires and capals
under the floor in the house.
There's also over 200 gallons of paint use
and approximately 1,500 linear feet of hand-painted canvas
in just in the house chamber.
I'd also like to thank you, Mr. Speaker.
you and your staffs work on this project,
especially the works of the efforts of Terry England
and Chris LaRally, which really helped us with this project.
So thank you.
I also want to express my appreciation
to the First Lady of the House, Ms. Dale Burns.
Without her dedication to hard work,
this team would not have been successful.
So thank you, Ms. Stone.
So to wonderful pride in this and we're proud to work with her.
But on behalf of the team, I would like to close by thanking the Governor, the Senate
and the House for entrusting us with this project.
Each of us consider this honor of our lifetime for our career and personally.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity,
and we've got a little video for you.
Thank you, sir.
the
The whole day, the whole day,
You're still on, sweet song,
Keeps your journey on my mind.
Your journey on my mind.
I said, and your journey on my mind.
God, God, the sound of you, the sound of you, the sweet and blue,
Cause moonlight through the past
Over arms reach after me
Over high smile, tindery
Still in the peaceful dreams I see, the road be back to you.
I said, Georgia, oh, Georgia.
That's pretty awesome.
How we y'all can get all that done in this period of time is really almost mind boggling.
A lot of people, a lot of effort.
Thank you for all those involved in the work.
Please let your employees know how grateful we are.
The work here is exquisite.
We travel across this country looking at some of these
contractors, and I can tell you, our capital, as we all know,
is one of the most beautiful capitals in the country,
if not the most beautiful.
But what the work's been done here just really brings us back
to the state of art, if you will.
and it's the craftsman that work for you guys
and working in the junction with GBA,
a big shout of thank you goes out to them
and please express that to your employees.
We most appreciate their efforts
to make this a very best it can be and you succeeded.
From the Georgia growing carpet casing,
pretty cool stuff, right?
First time ever.
So thanks to all of the resources
assets we have in Georgia that will make this possible to all the areas
cleaner than in here than 50 years ago when you first came here so we know
that as a child I know as a child so many wonderful things and improvements
here the brass polished up very very well how about your seats are they starting
settle in a little bit, getting comfortable? I don't want to hear it. It's all good, right?
So we appreciate all of the work Gerald again. Thank you and thank you to the team for everything
you've done to make this the very best place it can be and I thank you all succeeded. So thank you
you again. Let's give Gerald and the team one more round of applause if you will.
Members, if I can continue to have your attention, we have another special event today.
We have our doctor of the day, Dr. Hoffman,
Excuse me.
Now, this is the second Dr. Kaufman that's been a part of physicians of the day, doctors
of the day here at this house.
And I'm going to allow him to make remarks here, because I think it's noteworthy.
There's 70 years between he and his dad who served us in this house as doctor of the day.
35 years for this Dr. Kaufman and with Dr. Kaufman is his daughter Sidney and she's a graduate
student at Emory.
Let's welcome Sidney to the Georgia, to the people's house.
Public health, that's close enough.
We'll let her come in and be a doctor today as well.
So at this point in time, just as a show of respect and appreciation, I want to ask Dr.
Kaufman if he would come up and bring a few words to us.
Dr. Kaufman?
Thank you.
It's quite an honor, and Mr. Speaker, thank you.
35 years, boy, it makes me feel really old, but I guess because I am, but it's been an
honor and a pleasure to do this and it's honor to follow my father's legacy.
He was a special friend of all the legislators and always was a big fan of the system.
My daughter, I've been doing this 35 years, who I finally got somebody from my family to
come and I'm really proud of her going to grad school and she's almost done.
Thank God.
No.
No, but you know, the service we serve here and the people, it's surprising how many people
will actually need a doctor during the day here.
But really, it's great to have the doctor,
but we are certainly not the most important person here.
The most important person over there
hiding in the corner, Julia, the nurse at the nurse day.
That's the one who deserves a little cry.
Thanks again and I hope to see y'all at next section.
Let's go to the photo, let's go to the studio, come on up.

of the 104th, a resolution relative to meetings
and adjournments of the General Assembly.
Major Leader is recognized to speak
to the resolution, House resolution 998.
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I am so excited to announce to you all here today
that the House and Senate have come to an agreement
with respect to a scheduling resolution
for a historic fourth year in a row
to be announced the first week of session for all 40 days.
This is really exciting.
When Speaker Burns was first elected as our speaker,
he supported having a full 40 day calendar.
And I as a member, that was so important to me
because I knew just what a strain that this is
on all of us to do this job,
to be away from our families, to be away from our businesses
for others who depend upon us.
And so to know when we're going to be in session,
when we're not, and also to have potentially weekend days
where maybe we're working,
but just in our district offices,
not here at the state cap and be able to plan
to have Fridays off or a Monday off
adjoining a week and was very important.
So the calendar that is up on the board
and you all should have copies, I believe, at your desk
would have us in all weekdays this week.
So we'd have through day five
and then we would be in budget hearings,
the appropriations committee, join appropriations hearings,
would begin next week.
So the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday would be on Monday
and then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday would be those hearings.
We would have the session for the following four days
and then into February.
We would be in session for Monday, February 2nd
to Friday February 6th. We'd have four days in session February 9th to 12th, February 17th to 20th,
we'd be in session. Then a committee work day on Monday February 23rd as we anticipate
crossover day coming up. Then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday that week. The following week we'd have
another Monday committee work day and then committee work day the day before
crossover which would be Friday March 6th so that you can plan for in advance.
Then from there we've got committee work day on Wednesday March 11th and the
following week a committee work day on Tuesday March 17th St. Patrick's Day which
is very important to members from Savannah who may need to get back for important community
events.
The following week, we have committee work days on Tuesday, March 24th, and Thursday,
March 26th, so that there's opportunity for hearings anticipating Sunny Die, which
will be Thursday, April 2nd, for capital staff, capital security for our constituents.
who want to come here to the Capitol, having a set 40-day calendar this far in advance is incredibly helpful and it means so very much to them.
And so I would ask for your favorable consideration.
I will share that a distinguished member of this chamber shared with me religious observance that needed to be considered as I was working on this calendar and negotiating with the Senate.
And that date that was given to me was Passover satire on April 1st.
And so we made sure that that was considered here.
As I understand, any other questions or concerns as to a satire which may occur on a second
night, that there's understanding and agreement that there's no issue with us having Sinidah
that evening.
So I'm a Christian, and I've previously been here on Good Friday for legislative work,
including Sonny Die.
And so I understand that we often have religious holidays and observances that we need to take
into consideration, but I believe that this is a fitting and appropriate 40-day schedule,
and it's something I really wanted to bring to all of you here on day one, so you had some
predictability for this session.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to yield the well and ask the members for their favorable
consideration of a 40-day legislative schedule announced the first day.
Thank you.
Would you really need to answer a question?
Yes, sir.
I'll be happy to.
Got it.
Our ripsage, Ramon, at the turnout to your left, is recognized for a question.
Hey, I'm warning.
And happy new year.
And thank you for working on this because it really does play a huge difference for all
of us.
For my understanding, there was sort of some outreach middle of December about EID, which
as you know, I always joke about Ramadan being during session, it's a whole 30 days.
I have kept my crankiness to a minimum, but the, for my understanding, the issue is actually
Friday, March 20th, which is EID the end of Ramadan, and usually there's like prayers
people travel, see family, and we do have staff that could be impacted.
Is there any way that we could potentially shift the committee work day that week and
and then just switch them out, essentially.
Well, to the representative, I respect your question.
This issue was not brought to me until this morning.
And it was something that I actually brought up initially,
as it was being discussed a moment ago.
The, as I understand it, religious holidays,
such as this holiday that you've referenced,
may be over several days.
what I would just say is that holidays that are celebrated,
maybe at different times of the day,
that that understanding and accommodation
can be made certainly.
So that if there's an evening time celebration
or something like that, we may not be in session.
But I would just say that this schedule's
been very carefully vetted.
I have taken all input as it has been shared to me.
And if a member has concerns about a specific day,
I would just ask you bring it to me
in advance of the first day,
because I'm trying to get you a schedule here on the first day
so you can plan for it well in the session.
With that, Ms. Speaker, I'll yield the well
and ask the body's favorite consideration.
How about if I get you to answer a couple more questions?
Yes, sir.
I'll be happy to have you.
Representative Luppton is recognized for a question.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my goodness, these new mics are a thing, aren't they?
Thank you so much, Mr. Majority Chair,
Mr. Majority Leader, for providing us this.
And thank you, Mr. Speaker, because I know that this is an effort that you have done.
I've heard the horror stories of people who have served before me, who have been trying
to schedule bits and pieces at a time, so I really am grateful for this.
I just wanted to ask that in light of what my colleague has brought, if this can't be
changed this year, I would just like to make a request that this be taken into advance,
take it into advance notice for next season,
other legislative sessions.
I have an open door policy in my office.
Any representative wants to come see me
about any issue you're welcome to do so?
One thing.
Thank you so much.
Representative Lynn Smith, up, sir,
I'll recognize for a question.
Thank you, gentlemen, yields.
Yes, ma'am.
Is it not true that this is my 30th year
in the General Assembly?
Yes, ma'am, if the lady so states.
Is it further not true that this is the first time I've seen us have consensus on a calendar
and have it voted on the very first day of session, I commend you for your work.
Well, I mean so much to me, the Chair, ladies, comments.
I will just say that this would not have been possible without Speaker Burns leadership
and support to see this through and a great working relationship with Majority Leader
Jason Ann of Attarte who's now serving on leadership over in the state Senate
I was proud that we could work together to come to an agreement and present this to you here on day one
Miss speaker if there are no further questions I want more from the minority leader
Representative hegly is recognized for a question
Thank You mr. Speaker does the gentleman you? Yes, ma'am. I too want to
convey my thanks for this schedule, but I also want to
to suggest that as we move forward, I'm happy that the majority leaders get together, but
we need to place an opportunity for the minority leaders to have some input before the schedule
is printed.
Thank you so much.
Well, Madam Leader, I'll just say you and I have always been able to communicate very
well, look forward to continuing that in the future.
And in all seriousness, I know we have talked in previous sessions about, and your anniversary
is April 4th.
That was a weekend, I didn't have to be concerned about that date this year.
Thanks to the body, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask the body's favourable consideration of House resolution.
With the gentleman here for one more question.
Yes, sir, and now to finish him up, I promise.
Representative Cannon has recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Leader, I think transparency is super important.
There were certain members that were reached out to and asked about a certain day.
There were other members that were not reached out to, including the minority leadership team.
And so, to see a press release really expressing that everyone had been conferred was difficult.
The question is, would you consider making a amendment for the date of March 20th to understand
that many Georgians observed the lunar calendar of which eat falls?
Well, with respect, I just need to set the record straight.
I took input from anyone who was willing to communicate with me about this in advance
and the member who asked for us not to be in session on the date of a religious observance.
That was brought to me and we made sure that that was addressed in the calendar.
So I have always felt I've operated in very open and fair manner.
What concerns me about this debate is the 40 day calendar may be very difficult to do
in the future if getting something, getting a calendar before you becomes controversial
in this sense.
I would just ask that any member who has concerns about a specific date, please bring it to me
well in advance.
We can take into consideration our very best to continue to provide you with a 40-day
calendar.
With that, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Leader, there's one more question.
Would you use a question for me?
Yes, sir.
So I think there are 180 members of this house.
Last time I checked.
Yes sir.
I don't want to thank you and please every one of them.
So you're doing a great job within the confines and I definitely understand those confines
of working with the Senate to try to hammer out, if you will, a calendar that works with
the appropriations chair.
So we can get our most important job done and that's a budget and have adequate consideration
of that budgetary cycle that we go through here.
Having all members of this House heard an opportunity to be heard on committee days.
No less than a almost a miracle working with the Senate.
I'll just be honest about that, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Leader, excuse me.
So I certainly as a member of this House appreciate.
I'm sure the staff does, public safety does,
and all of those that support us in this house
support your work on bringing together
a lot of different opinions and views
and being respectful of all the members of this house
and everything's supported all of us
and our personal lives and our lives as legislators.
So I just wanna express to you and say thanks
for your hard work.
It's been a pleasure working with you on this calendar
and I hope this house will adopt this calendar today.
I have confidence they will, so that's my question.
Thank you for your work, continue to do the good work,
and let's see what we can do with the Senate.
You think you have some success over the Senate
with this calendar, Mr. Leader?
I sure hope so, Mr. Speaker.
And thank you for your comments.
I couldn't have said it better if I tried.
There is a tremendous amount of work
that goes into being able to present this to you.
And I'd ask for your favorable consideration
so that we can get this adopt to get it transmitted to the Senate so that they can pass it as well.
Thank you, and I yield the well.
The leader is yielded the well.
Members, thank you for your questions.
Is there any objection to adoption of the resolution?
There is objection.
Does the gentleman move?
Gentlemen moves, all those in favor of adopting the resolution will vote yes.
Those opposed will vote no on the resolution to adoption of the resolution.

the resolution the a the yays are 150 and the days are 27 the resolution has been adopted.
for what purpose to the leader of the station rise?

Mr. Speaker, I move that House for Resolution 998 be immediately transmitted to the Senate.
Speaker, excuse me, leader of the station moves that House for Resolution 998 be immediately transmitted to the Senate.
Is the objection?
Here in none of the so ordered.

Reps of the aisle is recognized for a very, very important announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's that special time of year again.
You might have noticed that the bloodmobile is right outside the Capitol just to make it easier
for people to donate blood.
Again, I recommend that people hydrate well
before they go donate blood.
I would recommend you drink two full bottles of water
before you go in and get one of their gatorades
when you finish up, but it's easy.
I gave this morning, as you can see, it took me
about 40 minutes, and that was with some dead time
of them, chitchatting with me.
This year, I just wanted to also make a note
that I would like to dedicate this blood drive
with blood cells to the memory of chairwoman Mandy Ballinger and to the mom of one of our
dear friends Omar Crawford is mom Carolyn Crawford.
We recognize that cancer is a thief and donating blood buys families more time.

That completes our announcements. Members, I looked at your attention for one more minute if you don't
mind. I was going to do it earlier, but I think now is the more appropriate time. I want to thank
Representative Williams for organizing the Tillman Convocation yesterday.
How many years is this now, Representative Williams?
30 years total, we've come together on Sunday afternoon before the session begins.
23, the representative Williams is taking the lead on that, be better tomorrow.
