TRANSCRIPT
----------
Some Republican lawmakers are weighing a
different approach to how the state
spends taxpayer dollars. The proposal
would require state agencies to justify
every dollar they spend in every budget
cycle. We're going to discuss the pros
and cons with our guests, Republican
Senator John Alers of Roswell. He is
chairman of the Senate Public Safety
Committee and vice chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. Also here is
Democratic Representative Mary Margaret
Oliver of Decatur. Her House committees
include appropriations, governmental
affairs, judiciary, and judiciary
juvenile. Welcome to lawmakers this
session. We love having you on all the
time. Thank you. So, we're going to
start with this zerobased budgeting for
viewers who are hearing this for the
first time. What does zerobased
budgeting mean and what does it mean
just in practice too?
>> Certainly. Well, zerobased budgeting is
what we all do at home each year. You
know, we sit around that kitchen table
as typically as a family and you budget.
You don't just take what I had last year
and add a little bit or subtract a
little depend on what's happening in the
world. You look at what your priorities
are and you make sure you're building
them accordingly and things change in
our lives just like they do in our
businesses. Uh businesses have been
doing this for a very long time and it
makes sure that we're doing a very
proactive approach of doing the right
thing with taxpayer dollars because here
in Georgia, we don't have any money. We
have the money from our taxpayers. We
want to be really good financial
stewards of those dollars.
>> And you said Georgia used to do this.
>> We did. We had a bill that uh expired.
It was a run for 10 years and it ended
just a few years ago. Uh it worked well
and we want to make sure we put that
same examination back on those dollars.
Uh and working uh as one of the most
fiscally responsible states, we want to
make sure we stay there.
>> Okay. Representative Mary Margaret
Oliver, you you were here through that
before and after. Okay. Do we need
zerobased budgeting?
>> We did have it. Most states do have it
in one form or another. As a pragmatic
matter, I think we do look at the budget
from the get-go every year. I've been on
the appropriations committee for a long
time. I went and looked at OPB's website
as to how they were reporting on their
zerobased budgeting when the bill was in
effect for its 10 years. There were
100page reports after 100page reports.
Did anybody ever read those reports? And
can you prove to me that that mechanism
was effective? Has it really changed
much in other states? Would it change
much here? I'm pretty sure I would have
voted for it at the time, but let's look
at this this bill that has a good label
to it, but I just don't know if it's
changed that much. If I were in charge
of changing the budget process, I would
approach things differently.
>> Okay. Chairman Alers, you say this
approach cuts waste. Can you give us a
concrete example of how that happens?
>> Absolutely. It's not really just about a
report. It's about as we build the
budgets every year, as we work together,
you don't want to just take what we did
last year and say, "Hey, the budget's up
a few percent or down a few percent."
Because things are changing. So, we want
to look at that is the staffing ratio
right as an example for uh an area where
we're serving constituents. Are we
implementing tools like artificial
intelligence or other technology? Are we
doing things smarter and better uh to
make sure we're utilizing those dollars
right? and and contracts change and
times change and we always want to make
sure we're laser focused on that. We
have a great state. In fact, fiscal
responsibility has always been our
mantra and that's why we have a balanced
budget every year and we do so well, but
we need to continue to focus on it and
that's our job as legislators.
>> Okay. Representative Oliver, I know you
want to talk about some other things so
I want to get those in. You want to talk
about the crisis with defax foster care
contracts. There's a shortfall there,
too. There's an $86 million deficit in
defect spending for abused and
traumatized children who've been taken
away from their families, which is a big
deal. When the state of Georgia takes a
child away from a family, the law, it's
constitutional right they're accepting
from the family. And the law says you
have to provide services to that family
to reunite the family, treat the family,
or find a permanent placement.
cancelling contracts that provide over
28,000 services for these 10,000
children, most of which are court
ordered, is a real problem. I think it's
a crisis. And the nonprofit community
that has provided most of these
placements and services, can't afford to
have their budget slashed without or
with 10 days notice um and stay in
business. I think it's an emergency that
I've asked the governor to use emergency
funds to restore the contracts.
>> And what are you what are you hearing?
>> Not hearing much. I know the state's
going to do something. I know we're
going to do something, but these
contracts are my top priority. We also
need an audit. If you we've been through
this will be the fourth our supplemental
budget and our fiscal year 27 budget.
This will be the four budget cycles
where we've run multi-million dollar now
$86 million deficits and defect
spending. That's not right. We've got to
fix this problem and serve these
children as the law requires us to.
>> Okay, we're going to keep up with that.
I want to get back to your zerobased
budgeting. You say that it will lead to
smarter government, not just smarter uh
smaller government. Explain that a
little bit.
>> Absolutely. We've got a growing
population in Georgia, which is
wonderful. People have moved here from
all over the country. Although I always
remind them, don't vote in the problems
you just escaped from. But why they're
here, what we want to do is make sure
that as we need more services, we need
roads, we need bridges. Unfortunately,
we need things like prisons and we need
public safety and we need all these
other things that we're doing it right.
Because it's not just throwing a body or
a dollar at it. It's doing things smart
and better than we did in the past.
Think about 20, 30 years ago, how we
used to work versus the way we do work
now. And techn is evolving so fast that
we want to harness all those things and
make sure we're building our budgets
just like uh Representative Oliver just
said, that's a great place to start with
zerobased budgeting. If something
continually is having a budget deficit,
that means we're not doing a really good
job to planning to begin with.
>> So you can see it from that point of
view.
>> I can see it from that point of view. I
would approach the deficit and defects
differently than zerobased budgeting.
But I do think we have cut the numbers
of state employees. For instance, in DOT
by 100%. Used to be 8,000 employees. Now
they're 4,000. Those are rough numbers.
We have cut employees. We've eliminated
our private telephone system in the
state. That saved,00
employees. The point I'm making is that
we have been trying as a fiscally
conservative state. We have been trying
to update our technologies. We're
struggling in the way that every
business does. I certainly struggle with
technology in my small business and
every state does. It's not a panacea
zerobased budget. There are other things
I do first. For instance, we're a
fiscally conservative state, but does
that mean we should be 50th in arts
funding? The arts are a bigger industry
in Georgia than peanuts. It's a bigger
industry than many, many other things
that we fund elaborately. Why is Georgia
50th? That's not being fiscally
conservative. That's 50th in arts
funding. That's not fiscally
conservative. And that's the kind of
issue I want to talk about.
>> Okay. I want to get to something else
you want to discuss before we run out of
time. Crisis beds. You we're we don't
have enough of them in this state.
>> We don't. Georgia has been part of a
mental health reform that is recognized
in the nation as something a very
positive step forward. We struggle with
how we deal with people in psychiatric
crisis modes. That's when they can be
violent, when they can be violent to
themselves. And enough crisis beds we
project are a great number more than
what we have now. We don't have
permanent placements in psychiatric
hospitals. We have crisis beds that will
serve people for three to 10 days
perhaps to become stabilized. And we are
funding those more. But we have and we
have come out from under a federal
justice department civil rights
settlement which is a huge
accomplishment. But many of our
communities kairo Georgia or adult or
Decar Georgia or Atlanta are dealing
with a homeless mentally ill population.
It's visible. It is concerning to all
our cities and counties and many of
those individuals come in and out of
crisis mental issues. that come in and
out of jails and we are not managing
that issue of crisis psychiatric care in
an efficient way in a fiscally
conservative way. We need to serve those
people in a way that we prevent crisis
when we can and prevent the kind of
treatment that they deserve
>> and that is something on appropriations
you will be discussing I I would
imagine.
>> Yes ma'am. All right, before we let you
go on this, is there a risk that
essential programs, especially in areas
like education, public safety, could be
affected by chopping the on the chopping
block if we go to this zerobased
budgeting?
>> Not at all. In fact, we did it for 10
years very successfully. And if you look
at where we are in Georgia right now of
having record surpluses, great fiscal
conservative, it got us to where we are.
We want to continue down that path
because if it ain't broke, we shouldn't
fix it in this place. We're going to do
it right.
>> Yeah. So, you're talking about that in
appropriations on your end and you're
talking about your DBH DDD issues on
your end. So, we thank you so much for
>> what you both do. Thanks for coming on
this show to talk about
