you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you amendment to House for the 993. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 993 to be entitled to amend part two of Article 3, Chapter 12, the title 16 of the Fish go to Georgia annotated related offenses related to minors generally so as to provide for the offensive grooming a minor for indeeds and purposes. Representative Powell has recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. As y'all know, there's a lot of bills that I do over the time and nothing has been more emotional with me than this bill that we passed a few weeks ago. This was because of an incident that I became knowledge about and that was that sexual predators that prey upon our children. And they'll start grooming these children at the young age for the purposes that there's a dastardly commit. We had a young lady at the age of 10 and a half that a guy started grooming at the YMCA. 16 other actions happened when she found out that this wasn't true love and that he went on to someone else that she took her life. Took her life. You know, there's a lot of things that I would do. There's a lot of things that I can say about this type of behavior and not of them are good. But I would ask this House to agree to the Senate's substitute. What the Senate did in the Senate Judiciary Committee with the cooperation of the Prosecuting and Attorney's Council had added some language. And the language basically and interpretation was saying that it's non-defensible for an accused to say the images that they may put on the internet or on some kind of electronic media aren't a real kid. And that's quite frankly the change they made. Tightens this up. The Prosecuting and Attorney's Council said this would give them a stronger position to go after these predators. And I would certainly appreciate your consideration for this bill to move it forward. I thank the Speaker for allowing us to bring it out. There's someone I would like to recognize the Cobb family. The parents are Jennifer Cobb. And I would like for you to look at this poster. This family has started a movement about Justice Virginia forbid it could be a justice for anybody. It could be a justice for your children, your grandchildren, your nieces, your nephews. And this is picking up steam to make this type of behavior known to those folks. I want you to look at the picture of this beautiful young lurch lady. And then I want you to think about your own children or those you may know. And Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any further questions. But I would certainly appreciate your vote. Gentlemen, you don't have any questions outstanding job. To the Cobb family, thank you for being here. Thank you for your advocacy on behalf of your daughter. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 993, all those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? All members voted. Yes, so the clerk will lock the machines. On the gentleman's motion, the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 993. The yeas are 172. The nays are zero. And this House has agreed to the Senate substitute. Thank you, members. Representative David Clark is recognized for a motion. Representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I like the House to agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House. 1046. That's a good part. Mr. Clerk, will you read the captions? House Bill 1046 to be entitled to amend code section 16, 1372 code section, 33162, an article 7 of Chapter 7 of Title 31 of the official go to Georgia and Tater relating to the sale distribution or possession of dangerous drugs. Representative Clark is recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1046, the new language coming from the Senate, the substitute, we added the to allow physicians right now they can hire say four APRNs, four PAs, and this will allow them to have the flexible ratio of deciding how best they're going to add them. Since they had six PAs and two APRNs, and it will help a lot in different offices with the physicians to be able to have that flexible ratio. So that's the addition from the Senate substitute. And then also the House amendment. I've added the Georgia Commission on Internal and Infant Health, the bill that we passed, all yes votes here in the chamber. And so that is the amendment, and I'll be glad to take any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You have the well and ask you a favourable consideration of House Bill 1046. Gentlemen, as you were to the well, is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? Chair, here's known in the House amendment is adopted. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1046 as amended by the House. All those in favour will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute as amended by the House of House Bill 1046, the A's of 169, the NAES1, and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute as amended by the House. Chair, recognize this representative Tyler Paul Smith for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I may this House agree to the Committee Conference report on Senate Bill 73 that we adopt that conference committee report. Mr. Clerk, will you read the conference committee report? Committee of Conference on Senate Bill 73 recommends that both the Senate and the House of Representatives receive from their positions and that the attached Committee of Conference substitute to SB 73 be adopted for the Senate and in a Mar-a of the 31st, Hustetler of the 52nd, Tilly of the 19th for the House. Smith of the 18th, Wheat Hour, 121st, Carpenter of the 4th. Chairman Smith has recognized to explain the Committee of Conference report for Senate Bill 73. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, good evening. I bring to you this conference committee report. There's a lot of hard work going into this. I want to thank the Speaker personally for his leadership and guidance. I'll go through real quick with you section one. This requires that the State Bar Georgia create rules related to soliciting any media for the provision of legal services that solve these billboards you see out there on interstates and byways. Police such rules shall prohibit misleading or false representations, disclose the place of business of the law firm, prohibit depiction of a person not employed by the firm as employed by the firm. It would also prohibit a person who is not a client of the firm as a client of the firm and require that disclosures compromise no more than 10% of a solicitation. The rules 7.1 of the Georgia Bar prohibits making a false or misleading communication about the lawyer of the lawyer's services. Rules 7.2 requires disclosure of among other things identity and physical location of attorney and use of a non attorney spokesperson, betrayal of a lawyer by a non lawyer or of a client by a non client. The OCGA 10-1-427 prohibits advertisements of legal services from using any misleading statements and from falsely portraying individuals as clients. This provision is enforceable by the Attorney General by a cease and deceased order, a violation of such order being a misdemeanor. Senate Bill 73 would also entitle any member of the State Bar and good standing or any person who sees or hears a solicitation violating the statute or rules prohibiting false or misleading advertising to bring a cause of action against the soliciting person. Courts may impose a $10,000 civil penalty for each violation and award attorney's fees, expert witness costs and other costs associated with bringing that cause of action. The owner of the media displaying or publishing the solicitation would not be held accountable under this Code Section or State Bar real supporting it. I'll point you to Section 2 which would be amending OCGA 46-5-27. This would allow for injunctive relief and civil damages for citizens of Georgia who have elected not to receive telemarketing calls but continue to receive those calls. This bill also removes the requirement that a person or entity that makes a soliciting phone call to a person on the no-call database that complies or disseminates information from the no-call database, contrary to law or that blocks color identification during a solicitation call be made knowingly. That is, there is strict liability for these offenses. The pre-existing defense of reasonable practice and procedure to prevent violation is limited to where calls are made by another entity on behalf of the defendant. The defense is added where a defendant is provided the number of a person on the no-call database by another subscriber and that defendant does not know and has no reason to know that the number provided was on the no-call database. This also exempts our local telephone providers, wireless services and voice over internet protocol services from that liability for solicitation calls made using their services. With that, Ms. Speaker, that is the hard work and summary of what we have here in this bill and I will yield for any questions if there are any. You have a question from St. Jason Ridley to your right. How's the question? My friend, you'll tell him my friend from chance. On line 28, when it talks about a prohibition against the person depicting an individual who's not a client, does that say that they can't use actors on that say that they want money? It has to be an actual person. That's my interpretation as well. You see that a lot on TV. I've seen it all growing up. I know you have as well. Yes sir, that is the intent behind this. One follow-up, please. Sure. When does this take effect? It would actually take effect. I'm going to go back and look just to make sure. My understanding is that it would go into effect upon seeing the chair of the governor. All right. Thanks so much for the pleasure. Yes sir. Gentlemen, yield for another question. Yes sir. Rimsing Jasmine Clark to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it generate yield? To my friend with the best questions, yes. So actually, the question I have goes along with what was just asked. Does this even include, like, this is just visual or can it also include, like, radio ads and things like that as well? You know, I think a good practitioner would make that argument that it would include those as well. But this is more for the targeting our billboard services that are out there. But I would say the practitioner could very well say that. You know, I have this saying in our committee that, remember, we're under a common law system trying to codify each and every thing is not really keeping with the civil justice or criminal justice systems that we have for that matter. So I think case law, there's good argument to be made for that as well. Gentlemen, for the more questions. Sure. I don't know if you hear them on your radio station if you hear them. But they'll say something like, oh, I got cash now. Or this lawyer got me $50,000. Are you saying that with this bill, they would not be allowed to air those types of commercials? Unless it was an actual client, that would be correct. Thank you. Gentlemen, you owe for another question, too. I will for one more. You have two, but I'll let you take one representative, Casey Carpenter, on your right in the back. This is gentleman yield to my friend from Dalton, I will. So I know this is not the bill I was looking forward to voting for today. But and you know, my stance on lawsuits, but anytime you can get two lawyers suing each other, I think I can live with it. I appreciate the legislation. Yes, sir. Last one. I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker. Your left representative Hilton has a question. Mr. gentleman yield. Yes, sir, to my friend. So I see this on TV. What is the harm to me, the consumer? You know, I'll use this example before my dear Nana left this world. She asked me if she had been an accident, whether I would use which firm out of Atlanta I would use. But I use Montlick, what I use Morgan and Morgan. And it was interesting. I said, well, Nana, I hope you do use the firm out of that because we can deliver just as good if not better result. And so the regular populace, there's advertisements for a reason. And so this is to try to make sure that truth and advertising is accomplished even in the legal profession. This is gentleman for the yield. Yes, sir. On line 46, it looks like it's a fine of $10,000 per violation. If there's a TV ad or a post of some kind that goes out to several thousand folks, is that several thousand times 10,000? That's per violation. So, you know, according to the evidence presented, I mean, you could prove multiple violations that that message was actually received by someone with technology today. I know it says 10,000 per violation, but that can add up pretty readily, I would say. And so that could be a huge hit for false advertising there. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you again for your hard work and guidance on this. I thank the members for the great questions I asked this body's favorable consideration to adopting the Commerce Committee report for Senate Bill 73. Gentlemen, as you did well, thank you for presentation. On the adoption of the Commerce Committee report on Senate Bill 73, all in favor of the adoption of the Commerce Committee report, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Now, all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of the Commerce Committee report on Senate Bill 73. The yeas are 167. The nays are four. And the report on the Committee of the Commerce report is adopted. Chair, nays going to recognize Chair Lady Cooper for a motion. Representative Cooper is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1072. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1072 to be entitled back to a men article 10 of chapter 8 of Title 31 in the fiscal year of Georgia and its entry related and drug repository program, so it's to revise definitions. Chair Lady Cooper is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1072. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, if you remember, we passed out in the original House Bill 1072, the bill that helps with our pharmacy that reclaimed unused medicines that are going to be destroyed and gives them to needy Georgians across our state. That's sort of a closed door pharmacy in essence is that it's not one where you walk in. It's all mill hoarder and therefore they needed extra help since they do not get their medicines packaged all need like a pharmacy would and it extended several and took care of several things they needed in expansion. This is also would allow hospitals if they make applications to the pharmacy board. Our closed door pharmacies which would be like in a nursing home that they said also applied to the pharmacy.

to have two more pharmacy texts than they haven't been allowed so far and that is the difference in the bills. I ask your favor for Senator Carration. Consider consideration on this issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies, yield to the well. On the ladies' motion, the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1072. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk. We'll unlock the machines. Have all members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the ladies' motion, the A's are on 169. The A's are on and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1072. Chairman Powell is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to ask the House to agree to the amended version of HV353 as amended by the Senate. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 353 to be titled and act to amend chapter 27 of Title 50, the Fishercoated of Georgia Annotated, the Georgia Lottery for Education Act, so as to divide that administrative procedures and actions regarding bona fide, coin operated amusement machines, shall be subject to chapter 13 of Title 50. Representative Powell was recognized to explain his agreement to the Senate amendment to House Bill 353. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. This House Bill 353 was a co-am cleanup bill that we did a couple weeks ago. There was no changes made over in the Senate to any of the things that left all of the procedures, APA and opinion letters and all of that, the 3% tax increase that was going to give about $50 million more to Universal Pre-K, the gift cards that will stop a lot of the paying out of cash once they're implemented. And these are the non-reloadable and non-reloadable that do not redeem for cash. The amendment they made was a floor amendment. This is a procedural amendment. If you look on the view pool of the bill and look on line 232, and when I say a procedural amendment, the House only allows one amendment to pass on a floor on a floor presentation. To keep a second amendment that would have killed the bill in its entirety, they did one amendment and that amendment was to change the date. And that date that you're looking at changes the 50-50 date that would be reported to the lottery, it changed it from July the 20th to October the 1st of 2024. And that's quite franklell, it was a procedural amendment and it's the same identical bill that left this house. And I would certainly appreciate your consideration for the lottery for pre-K and all of those things. And gentlemen, has no questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask for your favorable consideration. Let's get this thing finished. Gentlemen, as you were to the well, along the gentleman's motion, that the House agreed to the Senate amendment to House Bill 353. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. All on the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 148. The nays are 18 and the House has agreed to the Senate amendment to House Bill 353. Representative Carson is recognized for a motion, Representative Carson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As noted before, we're still discussing Senate Bill 240. I move the House adhere in a point of committee of conference on Senate Bill 240. Mr. Clark, will you read the caption? Senate Bill 240 to be titled an act to amend Title 47 of the EF of Georgia and Senate relating to retirement and pension so as to revise the minimum and maximum allowable benefit. Is there objection? Chair here's none. The House has adhered. Chair points, Representative Carson of the 46th, representing Irwin of the 32nd and Representative Dubnik of the 29th as a Committee of Conference on Senate Bill 240. 240. Okay, members. Here's our posture. The process of printing some bills that just came out of rules, so it's going to take us a few minutes to do that. As we prepare to close a little bit later, we're going to go ahead and do our afternoon nightly orders at this point in time. I'm going to ask you, there are several afternoon orders that are going to be honoring some folks who serve their communities in this state, and I'm going to begin with Representative Hutchinson, Representative Hutchinson is recognized for an afternoon order. Good evening, colleagues. Unfortunately, I have to rise today to honor four-year-old Bella Wilson. Today was her funeral. She died a week and a half ago of COVID. She died on a Friday. She made four of that Tuesday. I know we fought a lot up here about who she wear masks and whether or not children should wear masks to school. I promise you, her parents wish they had that problem. I never wanted to get up here to talk about a four-year-old who died of COVID. Yet here I am. Her funeral is today. I missed it to be here, but she was just at my house. She was just playing with my dog. So please, a few moments for Bella and her family. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Thank you, Ms. Hutchinson, and prayers for the family. Beautiful little girl. Reps and even Hong is recognized for an afternoon order. Members, you may want to... Reps and even kids. Reps and even kids. You come down front, please. Reps and even Hong, reps and even kids. Members, you may want to stand again if you don't mind and give the lady your attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This Sunday we lost a really great soul. Zach Johnson was a lobbyist here at the Capitol. I'm a Zach in 2009 when we were... When we were interning together at the state senate and we dated for several years after that and stayed friends for a long time. It was a very unexpected death. He loved being here. He loved his job and he would go out of his way to do anything for anybody. He was a great friend. He was a wonderful son. I know his mom and his family. They're watching right now. He was a great uncle to his nieces and nephews. A great brother to his older sisters. Most of all, he was a great dad to three of his kids who are under the age of 10. We're really sad. I know many people here at the Capitol who have been here for a long time. Remember, Zach and I've heard from a lot of people and we're going to really miss him a lot. So please keep his family, especially his children and your thoughts and prayers and if we can take a moment for him. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Holland, for that. Remember it's prayers for the family. Thank you for you as well. Members, we're going to recognize a former member of this house and I'm going to ask if Representative Buckner and Representative Stetson and Representative Deloge, Representative Williams that served with Mr. Ward Edwards. Representative Stetson, Representative Parsons, Representative Stevens, Representative Dickie, Representative Vance Smith, all friends of a former member of this house, Representative Ward Edwards, Representative Eugley. Representative Buckner. We rise to mourn the passing of Ward Edwards of Butler, Georgia. He died day before yesterday at the age of 94. He had served in this house. He was first elected in 1966 and served for 26 years and he loved us so much. He came back to be the doorkeeper. During his time serving here, he was a majority whip, Caucus Secretary. He served on education, governmental affairs. He was the vice chair of Interstate Cooperation and the Secretary of Rules. He was also the member of the UGA Gridiron Society. He served on the Georgia Department of Transportation Board. He just loved Georgia politics and he loved Taylor County. He has a building that is full of all kinds of Georgia political memorabilia and he has survived by his daughter, a brother, a sister and a host of nieces and nephews. A lot of these folks that served with him may want to say a word or two but he was a friendly, gregarious fellow that like I say loved politics, loved Georgia and loved Taylor County. I'll just say that I have five bird houses that he made for me and beautifully decorated and I will cherish them for him. This award was my constituent in my county commissioner district when I served back in Taylor County and I served as his state representative and he was so well loved in the Taylor County community and he's definitely going to be missed and we will continue to honor his life and legacy for many years to come in the Taylor County community. So thank you members of the House. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. That's okay, I just want to say he was always very nice to us. I was in the minority there for 10 years and you know for some people here didn't make any difference. They were just always very kind, very gracious. And also mention his daughter, I'm looking out here to photographer. His daughter was the House photographer here for several years and so when you see some of the old, more grainy photographs we're taking with a 35 millimeter camera, she took those and but I remember him and I think about that building he has with all the old memorabilia down there and we'll definitely miss him. If I may, so I did not serve with Mr. Ward here in this body, I was not that fortunate but I did serve with Mr. Ward on the DOT board. I was a member of before I came here and he was quite the gentleman, love this house, love this community and love our state, love this family. Tholson prayers go out to a great Georgian Mr. Ward Edwards and our sympathy to his family. This battle for Mumbana Salvat's, if you will. Amen. Thank you members. Chairman Gunther. Chairman Gunther's recognized for an afternoon order. Chairman Stan Gunther. Thank you Mr. Speaker. As on your desk this morning you found this bottle of Sorghum syrup. For those of you that are not familiar with Sorghum syrup, when you taste this don't think that it's honey gone bad. It has a little different taste and old timer up in Blair'sville when I first moved up there and discovered this. He said it was an acquired taste. So it's very good on a hot buttered biscuit. You'll love it. But I just thought you might want to try a little taste of the mountains. Sorghum syrup. Good stuff. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I didn't get one by the way. I want to get one. Oh, excuse me, I got one Mr. Chairman. He's not paid attention to me. Mr. Chairman, please go to the way. Representative Gloria Frazier, would you join me for a moment? Representative Williams. Representative Al Williams, I need you at the front, Representative Hugley. I'm going to recognize a good friend and a fellow representative of mine. Good friend of mine and a fellow representative of ours, Representative Gloria Frazier. If you'll give the lady your attention, you're full attention, I would appreciate it. Representative Frazier. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This supposed to be a grand moment right now, but because of all the death that has just preceded me, I don't have that in me right now. The four year old shook my heart. And I thank you, Shelley, for giving her some fun times in the last few hours of her life. But I stand here today to say thank you and to also say goodbye. I have had the opportunity to serve for 18 years in this house. And it has been an honor to represent the people in Richmond, Burke, and Jenkins County for the last 18 years. I've been through three appropriation chairs, Chairman Hatchet. Chairman England is right over here behind us. And Chairman Ben Harbin. And I have special, a special place in my heart for Chairman Butch Paris, who has always been there when I needed his assistant in helping the ones that are less fortunate than us. I thank God for the opportunity to have served with all of you and many of you that are at home and going on before. But I came up here with a mission. I came up here with a promise, something that legislators should never do. Make promises. We know that. It's hard to keep a promise. But I made a promise to a 32 year old young man 20 years ago that lived with sickle sale. And I promised him on his deathbed after he asked me if you ever misphrase your, get into a position where you can help with this disease, please help us. And he died a few days later. But I promised him on his deathbed that if I ever was in a position to help that I would. And I have done that. And everybody in this chamber know that when you see me, the only thing you see is SC. Because I made that promise, but I didn't know I would be able to fulfill it. So I like to thank the speaker at that time was the minority leader who helped me every year. Speaker Burns, every year to make sure that money was appropriated for sickle sale. I come to the way I'll to educate you about sickle sale for years to tell you about this inheritable disease that over 14,000 Georgians live with every day. 14,000 Georgians they want to go to work. They want to have a career. They want to have a family. But because of this pre-existing disease, they couldn't live the normal life that we live. So I want to thank you all for helping those 14,000. We are not there where we need to be in our budget. But standing with me today is representative Al Williams, representative Carolyn Hugley, who I am asking you to please support as they continue the quest to make sure that sickle sale is fully funded. It's been a ride, but I just want to say thank you and I'm going to go on now to chapter three of my six chapter book. I'm not going to say this is the last chapter. But it has been so enjoyable to work with you and we have passed some good legislation and I'm not going to sugarcoat it and some bad. But we work together collectively to do what's right. And my sickle sale family will always be with me everywhere I go. Shelly just buried a four year old, I just buried a 12 year old last week that has sickle sale. Our life ended short and we have to do better with educating and finding a cure. So on that I would like to thank all of you for your support during the years. I have completed my promise and I have served my district and I'm going to pat myself on the back because I have served my district well. Thank you. Great, great, great, great. Good job. In God's name, blessed family. Reps departure, would you be joining me? You know, we all have good fortune in life. I just tell you.

The good fortune to my life has been to serve with this lady and get to know her and to get some understanding about a terrible disease. That I'm going to assure you she is saved lives. She's made a difference because she has been a true champion in the fight combating sickle sale and looking for a cure. I'll also tell you I've served in a delegation with her. She's pretty tough. Yeah, I gave it to Butch first and I gave it to you, Jenkins County. So it was a great challenge there, but I can tell you she served her constituents in Southeast Georgia as well as anyone could. But what I know most about Gloria Frazier, she cares about people. She cares about her neighbors. And I've just been blessed and blessed to have known her and to continue knowing her for years to come and being supportive of her work. So Representative Frazier, Gloria, I appreciate you. Thank you for what you've been doing. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

So ladies and gentlemen, that is the what this bill consists of the substitute. And I'm happy to entertain any questions that you might have, Mr. Speaker, or your questions. You have a couple of questions representing Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman you? Yes, ma'am. Could you tell me what LC number you're reading from? Just a moment. It's LC 394407S. It was just handed out just a few moments ago. I don't think it's made it to the back of the room yet. Yeah, so I know the speaker is step to the side, but there are some of us in the room that have not even seen this bill at all. Should be on your desk. If there's not done passing them out, we have not received them. I literally just got it as I was standing here. Could we have a moment to review it? Everyone has the bill on your desk? No. No, the back of the room does not have the bill. I just wanted to get it out. If the gentleman won't stand down for a minute, I thought they were already in passed out. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. They're getting there. We'll stand at ease for a minute until we get the bills out. I thought they were out. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You Okay members, we're, I believe everyone has a copy now. Will you ask for the last question? If you have a couple of questions. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Representative Park Cannon has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the provision around the funeral processions? Yes, ma'am. So what's the penalty? Someone doesn't, you know, right now it's kind of a courtesy that we do in the South and in other places where you see a procession coming and you move out the way, but since we're shalying it, writing it into law, what is the penalty if you don't? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Line 138. Okay. Any person that's violating this section shall be guilty of a Mr. Leader. Yes, ma'am. Gentlemen, you have another question? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Representative Anolaweitz to your left. The recognition for a question. Thank you, Mr. Gentlemen. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. My question is actually about the multipurpose off-road vehicles. Are these the, like the side by side, the razors, the arsears, the kind of things that are... That's correct. Okay. And then looking at then in section... Oh, later on. Excuse me. I'm going to say this after a final procession. Right. Well, what I want to make sure is it's... When you're talking in section 8, part 8. So these vehicles still would not be subject to add the lorum taxation. Because that's an issue that I've been working on and hearing a lot about in my district about a lot of these being stolen. And then there's no add blurrum. There's no titling. Well, this help with that problem that we're having. I would suggest that these vehicles can now be tagged. Those can be purchased from the liquid tag offices. So I would suggest that it would assist without you, ma'am. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Speaker, no further questions. I'll yield the well. Ask for your favourable consideration for SB 110, LC 3944-07S. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. We'll have all members voted. All members voted. The clerk will lock the machine. All the passage of Senate bill 110, a yeas or 165, the nays or three. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Okay, members, we're going to take up Senate bill 395. Should have it on your desk. Senate bill 395, Senator Dixon, the 45th Watson, the 11th Walker, the 20th, the 17th and others to be entitled to amend. Part 3 of Article 16 to Chapter 2, titled 20, the fiscal to Georgia annotated, relating the student health and elementary and secondary education, so it's an authorized possession of opioid antagonists in schools. This bill I've referred to committee on education that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative McCullum has recognized to present the bill. Representative McCullum. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm not going to amend them. I'm in my amendment this time. I rise today to present SB 395. This is a bill that Senator Dixon brought over from the Senate. It's named after his cousin that lost his life to fentanyl overdose. It's named Wesley's Law. It's a combination of three bills. We amended the bills and the rules. It was two bills, 1035 and 1170, that passed unanimously out of the House. The legislation opioid overdose bill for 395, it essentially is a Narcan counter medication that's administered nasally. No training is required for no lots can. No negative side effects have ever been reported as result of this use of Narcan. This bill requires schools to supply Narcan and buildings unless it's supplied. Narcan is made difficult to obtain by medication. The shelf life of Narcan is three years. There's no special storage requirements. Many grants has included possibly for this opioid medication. What we'll be essentially doing is putting Narcan in schools. All the staff in schools will be readily available. They will be immune from liability as well as the school will be. But they'll have to call EMS as soon as they administer the drug. The other two pieces is also Narcan related bills. One was requested by Emory University and it applies to colleges. So they'll be allowed to put Narcan in vending machines and it covers all university campuses. The second part of that is they'll be put in Narcan in government buildings and courthouses that have AEDs. And so the Narcan will be put with the AED and that'll be in government buildings. That'll exclude universities. But this will cover everything. Fintinal I know everybody knows this is a terrible thing that's happening in our state. And luckily this year we've really made some advancements. I request your considerable favourable vote. Are you the well? You have a couple of questions if you want to answer them. Or you can do the well whatever your preference is. Oh yeah the well. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen. Gentlemen as you ordered the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none. Previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair here's none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair here's none. The Rules Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to a green to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Canterd Roz? Parliamentary inquiry? State chain inquiry. Isn't it true Mr. Speaker that to date Narcan has saved 27,000 lives according to the CDC and I have personally witnessed recessed to date some of my questions. This is literally a life saving measure. Is that true? That is true and I know the gentleman knows very much of what he speaks and thank you for your work in that area by the way. For what purpose is represented? Terry Cummins, Roz? Parliamentary inquiry. State chain inquiry. Is it not true that three students in the high school in my district this last year overdose on gummies. They were not aware that fentanyl was in those gummies and if it wasn't for the fact that Narcan was in that school they wouldn't be here today. So thank you for the bill. I'm sorry for that experience but thank you for bringing it to our attention. That's what this bill is all about. For what purpose is represented? Holly Roz? Parliamentary inquiry. State chain inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that blocks away from this capital? We fortunately have a gentleman who we were fortunate to honor last year Marshall Ransifer who made it his life mission not only to help the homeless but also to be one of the remaining souls there on site. When persons were literally in the throes of having their drug addiction where he practiced giving Narcan by actually injecting an orange and the soul was able to save lives before he succumbed himself. Thank you for making us aware of that and we thank that individual and certainly. I'm very sorry for his loss. Have all members now voted? It's so Mr. Clerk where you lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 395 the yeas 171 to nail is one. This bill Henry C. the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk where you read the caption to Senate Bill 502 502. Senate Bill 502 by Senator Dixon the 45th hatched to the 50th. Albers the 56th and others to be entitled back to a men part one of our three chapter five entitled 50 the fiscal to Georgia and intended relating to the general authority duties and procedures of the Department of Administrative Services. This bill I've referred to the committee and regulated industries that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Sheerboard say

to recognize to present the bill. Chairman Sains. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know the hour is late, so I'll be quick. Senate Bill 502 accomplishes several things. The main, one of the main items is ensuring that the state of Georgia doesn't bind itself with how it markets to Georgia citizens. We're making sure that there is no preempted list of vendors or outlets that the state of Georgia's tax dollars utilizes in marketing through any of its agencies as well as looking at the purchase of land through foreign adversaries, which you can find on lines 26 through 33. Sorry, the purchase of equipment through foreign adversaries, which is online 27, confusing good policy here. And as well as several provisions added on, one for the community service boards to ensure that they're allowed to meet virtually. And one that might be spoken to you through a parliamentary inquiry on natural gas. If there's no questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. You have a couple of questions. If the general will yield, I'll yield for two. Will Park, right to your left, recognize what question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Sains, on line 69 to 70, this bill defines media reliability and bias monitor, which this bill is not prohibiting any state agency from entering into. What is media reliability bias monitor? Can you give me an example? And again, why are we prohibiting this in Georgia? Yeah, I appreciate the question with Park. I'd like many bad things. It has a nice title. And basically what the effect is is that we are binding the state if utilizing this kind of monitor to not directly look at where we're putting our media, but letting a third party global list decide that an outlet is either useful or unuseful to reaching Georgia citizens. A good example of this that I like to look at is our D.B.H.D.s current look at reaching rural Americans and for suicide prevention as a target group. We know that specific sectors need specific outlets to be most effective at reaching that target group. And I think this just ensures that our agencies aren't binded by a predetermined list to reach our consumers on important issues like suicide prevention and economic development. Do you use it for one more question? Yes, sir. It's just to clarify, because the bill defines these organizations as ones that, again, rank to assess the factual accuracy of content and news to address misinformation, bias, adherence to journalistic standards and ethics. Again, I'm having a hard time understanding why we were prohibiting all state agencies from entering into a contract with or even using some of the information that could help eliminate some of the misinformation and disordering the state. We're in no way prohibiting the vetting of outlets in our marketing dollars. But what we're doing is not allowing that to be outsourced. We're trusting our state agencies and our public servants to understand where is the right place to put our public dollars when we're utilizing that for advertisement and not utilizing a predetermined list that is developed. I believe not even domestically, but internationally. Thank you. Gentlemen, you know, for another question, one more, Mr. Speaker. Chairman, purple to your right is recognized for a question. Is Jim and you? I do to my friend. Is it not true that sections 45 and 6 are a direct recommendation of the House of the Development Council? They are. Is it also not true, if you don't mind me asking, that this will allow some of our rural areas, some of those economic and stress parts of the state to have, as Speaker Rolston would say, the bright light of economic prosperity to help shine upon them. I appreciate that. And speaking of light, I think the natural lack of light coming from the windows over here say that the hour is late, and I'll yield the well to keeping us from being here further. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, does he order the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's done the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair here's known the committee's substitute is drawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute, offered by the committee on rules? Chair here's known the Rules' committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of theidade? was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair here's done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. Those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All the passage of Senate bill 502, the yeas, are 103, the nays, are 64 of this bill. And receive the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 307-307? Senate bill 307 by Senator Capatric of the 32nd Watson of the first Walker, the 20th and others to be entitled and act to amend to have 46 and title 33, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the certification. A private review agency is supposed to provide for health insurers to implement and maintain a program. This bill then referred to the Committee on Insurance that committee recommends this bill do pass by Rules Committee substitute. Representative Halkins is recognized to present the bill, Chairman Halkins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The underlying portion of this bill actually deals with reduction or prior approvals. This is when the insurance company requires your physician or dentist to actually have to submit paperwork so you can have the treatment done. So this reduces it by performance standards in evidence-based medicine. This was Senate bill 307 and it passed the Senate 50-1. Section 2 is actually House Bill 924, which passed the House 160-1. It deals with drugs that are administered by infusion centers, hospitals and physicians offices and provides access to life-saving drugs. It calls for a reduction, well, prevents reduction in payment by the insurers. The third section of the bill is one I particularly like that was House Bill 945. That deals with the hospitals and being in-network for state health benefit. What it does is it just aligns the calendar date with the state date rather than the contract date of the hospital and the insurer. If there are no questions, I will yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. Someone has no questions. He's yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none of the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the Committee on Rules? Chair, has none of the Rules Committee substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none of the report the Committee has agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of Senate bill 307, the yeas are 167. The nays 1, this bill haven't received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 429429? Senate bill 429 was senator's dollars out of the 27th and the 51st, the 18th and others to be entitled to amend titles 283150 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated or relating the General Assembly. Health and state government respectively serves the provider procedures and processes concerning the enactment of legislation, any adoption of rules and regulations. This bill I refer to the Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight that Committee recommends that this bill do pass by a rules committee substitute. Chairman Todd Jones has recognized to present the bill Reps. Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring to you the Small Business Protection Act of 2024 because of the rules substitute. I want to skip part two and go right to part three, which was the original part of the bill, then I'll come back to part two for you. Effectively, what part three does, which is the Small Business Protection Act, it redefines small businesses as 300 employees and less, and then it also calls for a series of different reports that can be provided to you by the Office of Planning and Budget and the Department of Audits and Accounts, effectively giving you timing, either before session, for you to request these reports in terms of what the implications will be on small business, and then during session it also gives you the timing in terms of when those reports can be provided to you. Those reports being obviously important so that we can understand what a true driver within Georgia is, which of course is our Small Businesses, and that's what part three does. Part two is the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act. I want to specifically call out a couple of our colleagues, representatives, Holcomb, Houston, Dempsey, Evans, and Buckner. I want to thank them for all the work that they have done on this, and it's a privilege for me to be able to carry this on their behalf. But effectively, what part two does is the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act. It provides a series of different processes, and it also provides for a panel to be created, which will be a five-member panel, the governor, the lieutenant governor, and then also the speaker will be appointing each of those five. You'll see that online to 81 through 88. It also goes through the eligibility requirements in terms of what the plaintiff, or in this case, the claimant would have to do in terms of being eligible for that wrongful conviction. I'll say claim, and then it also gives an amount between 60,000 and 120,000 per year, which can be prorated and is effectively affected up or basically put to the CPI on an annual basis, and then it also provides for all the procedures and all the timing. I know that the hour is late, and that is effectively a summary of Senate Bill 429. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we do have a speaker on the bill, one of the members who wishes to speak. Representative Scott Holcomb is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Really, I wanted to just say thank you to a few folks. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you. I want to thank the majority leader, the minority leader, Chair Lady Dempsey, Chair Lady Hauston, Representative Evans, Representative Buckner. They've all been working really, really hard to try to help individuals who were wrongfully convicted. I mean, you can only imagine having your life stolen from you and being prosecuted for something that you did not do, and then losing decades of your life, decades of your life. The resolutions that the House passed last year were tabled in a Senate committee. This year, there wasn't even a hearing. There wasn't even a hearing. I'm offended by injustice, and that really bothers me. So what this does is it does not solve that problem, but it keeps hope alive in terms of a wrongful compensation panel potentially being set up. Should this pass the Senate, should the Governor sign it, that then these people who probably lacked hope for decades, maybe just maybe we might do something to help make it right by having a compensation panel. So please vote yes. Thank you. Representative Hokeham, thank you for your work on this. All we can do is try. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there an objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The Rules Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted it, so the clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of Senate bill 429, the yeas are 161, the nays are 7, the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair, here's none. The bill has been passed. Chair, here's none. The bill has been passed. Chair, here's none. The bill has been passed. Chair, here's none. The bill has been passed. Chair, here's none.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you cheerleading dampsy is recognized for a motion you you you You is you Representative Dimpsi is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute and the House amendment. Representative Dimpsi, get the lady and the will. Your attention please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As some of you may know, this is an issue that I've been working on for the past several years specifically focusing on the General Assembly's desire to address the healthcare workforce shortage in Georgia, which includes having enough quality nurses. To expand the pool of quality nurses, one crucial element is to provide financial assistance and remove limitations. The original version of HB228 did this through a very narrow and targeted amendment to the Georgia Tuition Equalization Grant Program, specifically amending this code section to provide an addition to all the current private colleges and universities that are eligible for TEG, private college and universities, with high performing nursing programs would also be eligible. This passed our house overwhelmingly with bipartisan support last year and came back to us with the Senate's substitute. So what this House amendment does is delete the language added by the Senate in its entirety in section 2 and 5. In fact, the language in section 5 was passed through this house already on a separate bill from Representative Bonner, so it is no longer needed. The amendment would also add language to the existing section 4, which tightens up the original language of the bill and lines 70 to 86 to clearly restrict the funding for this section to TEG only. Mr. Speaker, that is what it will do. If there are any questions, I will be glad to take them. Lady Hasn't no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable support to help increase nursing capacity in our state. Please yield the well. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? Chair has done and the House amendment is adopted. On the ladies' motion, that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 228 as amended by this House. All those in favor will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. On the ladies' motion, the yeas are 159, the nays are 8, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 228 as amended by this House. Everyone have a copy of HB206, which has the distinction of being the last bill of the day. If y'all knew how ready I was, or I am, Representative Sains has recognized for a motion. Make a motion to agree to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 206. Mr. Clark, will you read the caption? Chairman Sains has recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and for members looking at their desk, House Bill 206, SCSFA. This bill simply opens a tool already available through our state statute. Unfortunately, the in the method is available. It's only done through downtown development authorities, and only two areas in our state, Metro Atlanta and Macon have DDAs big enough to allow this private enterprise tool to be utilized for economic development projects within their communities. We want to make sure that we add parity throughout the state for this product. We create the ability for economic development authorities, if they so choose to, if their county is so agreed to, to provide, see pace, commercial property assessed conservation, energy and resiliency financing, which utilizes the property tax method to bring to market complete private dollars at a lower interest rate to developers in our community that are looking to create projects above code, that could be energy efficiency or in areas like our coastal communities, it can be hurricane resiliency. I know it's a long bill. It is a useful product. The main thing that changed in the Senate's substitute is that instead of creating new see-paced authorities, we're simply allowing this tool to be utilized within our economic development authorities. If all local municipalities involved, the tax commissioners will agree to it. With that, Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, has one question to your left. Representative Mary Francis Williams. Well, gentlemen, yield. I do. So, could you please explain to me how this expands the authority that development authorities currently have? Sure. So, currently, this is not a tool that's within their code section. It's within the downtown development authority code section. So it simply allows if each given authority would like to utilize this tool if a private developer comes to them and says we have a project that fits within the scope of see-pace, they would have to that board would have to approve its utilization and all local governments that are affected by it would also have to approve that through an intergovernmental agreement. So, would the German further yield? I do. So, first of all, could you tell me what see-paces? Sure. As mentioned previously, it stands for commercial property assessed conservation, energy, and resiliency financing. It's meant to basically anything above code would be applicable. It can only be utilized for 20% of the project. And for our banking friends, we worked with them to ensure that it doesn't modify or implicate their financing. A developer, if they're financing through to the traditional means, they would have to get a pre-approval through their bank to allow for this financing to be utilized. So, will you further yield? I'm still not clear. So, development authorities currently have the ability to raise funds for projects. And this expands this, I mean, I know you're saying that they have to have certain conditions met, but exactly what does it allow them to do that they cannot do right now? So, it allows them to package the see-pace program. So, the see-pace program uses the property tax structure to put in the private capital at a lower interest rate, because that private capital provider is being secured through our property tax structure. So, they're offering it at sometimes one-third of the interest rate to that developer. And it's allowing them to be the conduit of that packaging, which is required to be put into their code section. And just one further question. So, does this do anything in terms of the tax burden on the local municipality? I appreciate that. There is no tax burden to any taxpayer state or local. I see it as an economic development tool that costs a Georgia tax fair zero dollars, because any even administrative cost incurred can be reimbursed through the package of the deal, which is within this bill. Gentlemen, there's a little bit about economic development has a question. Chairman Stevens to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, do you? I do. Isn't it true that the tax payers will not be at risk since these are not general obligation bonds, these are revenue bonds? They are, and I appreciate the question. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Everyone has yielded the well. On the general's motion that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 206, all those in favor will vote yes, those opposed. We'll vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted for what purpose does representative Reeves rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The State Genquery. Is it not true that this type of legislation is being used in Florida and around three dozen other states to have renovations and redevelopment, which is very efficient, and that there are properties in Gwinnett County where 21 House members represent that are ready to use this to redevelop properties. Sure, the gentleman knows of what he speaks. What purpose does Representative Taylor rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State Genquery. Is it not true that this is a great tool for protecting our environment and using a new means for financing and it does not include any tax from local or state tax funds? Sure, the lady knows of what she speaks and believes that to be so. What purpose does Representative Reeves sunrise? Bruce Reeves. Parliamentary inquiry. State Genquery. Is it not further true, Mr. Speaker, that this comes only when a dissipating lender approves of the arrangement. So it has to come with a participating lenders approval and the Georgia Bikers Association and the Credit Union are okay with this bill. Is that not true? I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. All the gentleman's motion that we agreed to the Senate's substitute on House Bill 206. The yeas are 72 and the days are 91 and the bill has been disagreed to. This House has disagreed to the Senate's substitute to House 206. For what purpose is Representative Sains rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move that the House reconsider his position on 206. House Bill 206. Has the time for the gentleman to pursue the motion of he or she so desires so the gentleman moves the reconsider. All the gentleman's motion, the House reconsidered his action in failing to and failing to agree to the Senate's substitute on House Bill 206. All those in favor of the reconsideration will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. All the gentleman's motion. This House reconsider his action is reconsidering the reconsidered Senate bill 206. The yeas are 100 and the days are 63. The motion carries and the House has reconsidered this action. The bill will be eligible to be taken up the next legislative day. Okay, members of the House, we've considered our last bill and our last action on day 39. Now we'll have a few bills we didn't get to so the following bills and resolution will be postponed to the next legislative day. Senate bill 543. Senate bill 198. Senate bill 208. Senate bill 351.
