Colleagues, I'm very honored today to introduce to you our chaplain, Dr. James E. Taylor. Dr. Taylor serves as the head of schools at Hebern Christian Academy in D'Aquila. That's where my son Charlie currently attends school. Dr. Taylor has a wealth of experience in education and has both a pastor's heart and a desire to give back to our community. Dr. Taylor's journey in Christian education spans 29 years. Before joining Hebern, he served in leadership roles at Calvary Day School in Savannah and New Testament Christian School in Norton, Massachusetts. His educational background is also impressive. He holds degrees from Messiah College, Bridgewater State University, and Mr. Speaker, you'll like this from Georgia Southern University. If you would, please join me in welcoming Dr. Taylor's wife, Karen, who's with us here today. Ms. Karen works as a third grade teacher at Hebern Christian Academy, and together she and Dr. Taylor have two grown children, Alyssa, who is a cardiac nurse and Colton, who's a recent graduate of the University of Georgia. In big news, within the family, they had their first grandbaby this week, Emily. Their family's dedication to education and service is a source of inspiration in our D'Aquila community, as well as to my own family. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Taylor has some experience as a school educator. He is used to sometimes addressing groups which can be somewhat unruly, but I have assured him that that Georgia House will be on its best behavior here today, and it's my privilege to introduce Dr. James Taylor at this time. Dr. Taylor. Well, they told me whatever I did, I was not allowed to take an offering at the end of this. I was told sometimes that you can't get out of that mode sometimes. Well, listen, as I was wrestling through the different passages scripture I would jump in on today, I decided, frankly, just to keep it really personal. I don't know whether you have a personal verse or a personal mantra or a statement kind of that you live by. I do. And out of Philippians chapter 2 and verse 3, it has been my life verse for my entire adult life, and I'm going to be totally honest with you. Here's why it's my life verse. It's my life verse because, frankly, I'm not really good at it. And it's something that I have to continue to challenge myself. I find that this verse challenges me in certain ways.

is that are not my default setting. So, Philippians 2, 3 is a simple verse. It's a simple verse to say, but it's a verse that I intend on spending my entire lifetime trying to apply. And this simple verse says this, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in all things, consider others before yourself. Now, that simple verse is so full of challenges for us. When I look at this, I kind of break this down into two different areas. First, he says, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. And let me just say, the writer of this, this was Paul writing to the church at Philippi. He does not say, do not be ambitious. That's not what he says. When we look at the life of Paul, we know that he was an ambitious student. He was actually kind of the lead pupil for the most famous teacher of the day. When we look at his life, he was brave in the fact that in his missionary journeys, he traveled throughout the entire known world. There certainly were no subways during that time. It was sandal power, right? So, he was just traveling place to place, but he traveled the whole known world during that period of time. So, he was an ambitious traveler. He was an ambitious missionary journeyer. When we look at the idea of the best-selling book of all time, the Bible, we recognize that Paul wrote more of that book than anyone else. He was an ambitious author. And so, when we look at this, he does not say, do not be ambitious. You wouldn't be in your seats today if you were not ambitious. If you were not seeing that, hey, there's a problem. And I want to be a part of the solution. And so, here it's not what he says. What he says is, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit so that we will consider others before ourselves. So, selfish ambition, the second part that I hit on this is the second part of that verse. But in all things, consider others before yourself. And so, when I wrestle with that idea of all things, I'm brought to the idea, if I am to apply this verse, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in all things, consider others before myself. If I am to apply that verse, if I can just say all things encompasses my relationship with my wife. If I'm living with that idea that I'm going to live for her interests ahead of mine, it changes my relationship. Now, here's where the magic happens. If she's living with that same mindset that it's my interest before hers, now you get this relationship where we're celebrating 31 years this coming summer. And we're still crazy about each other. Listen, that's what happens when you say, hey, listen, I'm going to consider others before myself. That idea in all things impacts the way that we parent. It impacts the way that we're impacting the lives of our sons and daughters and our grandchildren after that. That when we live with that idea of selflessness, it makes an enormous impact on the world around us. And obviously, in your positions of leadership and power, making some of the most important decisions in our state, and in our nation, which are coming out of this house, to recognize living in a countercultural way. Some of the byproducts of that idea, when we live in a countercultural way, like Philippians 2, 3 talks about, let me just say it's attractive to the people around us. Because the rest of the world doesn't live that way. The rest of the world lives with the idea, let me get mine. That's that mindset. When we say, let me help, let me live in a different way, there's an attractiveness to that, which I think is important in positions like yours. The second thing is that we can have confidence. That when we live in a countercultural manner, when we live with that idea, we're going to live for other people, we can have a confidence. Why? Because that confidence is not in us. That confidence is in a God who has all authority and all power that we can trust in that power that we get to be a representative of. And so very, very simply, that's my key verse, and it's a blessing to be here with you all. If you'll please rise as we close in prayer, and then we're going to also say the pledge here together. Father God, we just want to thank you, Lord, for this opportunity to be in this house today. I thank you, Father, for the men and women who have pledged their lives, Lord, in the pursuit of recognizing their authority under you, and also, Father, that they would be authentic leaders making wise decisions for their constituency. We know, Father, that it is a sacrifice for them to be here, and we thank you, Father, for that sacrifice. May you bless their days, Lord. May you bless this legislative period, Father, and may we honor you in all that we do and say we ask these things in Jesus' name, amen. If you'll please join me in the saying of the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I also miss it, but I'd appreciate it. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, open the doors, members, you may join Pastor James Taylor in the South Any Room for a photo, express your appreciation. Pastor, we appreciate your words today, and continue good luck and good fortune with the mission that you'll have at Hebron. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day was invited to come today and serve this house. My ribosene David Jenkins is Dr. Elizabeth Brass, Almond.

We'll move on to morning orders we have an invite resolution. Members will please come to the floor. Members please come to the floor and take your seats and give our honored guest your attention. You members will please come to the chamber and take your seats. Members will please take their seats. Senator you can't take your old seat but we would love to have you back. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to a resolution? House resolution 1181 by Representative Skoggins the 14th and Gamble of the 15th. A resolution recognizing and commending the Adairsville High School JROTC program. Thank you Mr. Clerk I want to recognize Representative Mitchell Skoggins to speak to the resolution and make some introductions. Representative Skoggins. Thank you Mr. Speaker colleagues I'm proud to have the Adairsville Junior ROTC with us today here in the people's house. My guest today is Lexi Boltman who is the principal of the Adairsville High School. We also have major sex hour with us and first sergeant Queen. Miss Boltman is going to give you a few words about our Junior ROTC that we are very proud of up in the Adairsville. As a 20 year educator I have come across many students and staff teams and groups that have worked really hard and achieved great success and encouraged me as a person but none of them have motivated me to do better and be better and honestly truly inspired me as a person like the Adairsville High School JROTC cadets. Good morning I'm Dr. Lexi Boltman the proud principal at Adairsville High School in the Bartow County School system. I have the honor and privilege of introducing our JROTC cadets in the gallery as well as major David J. Sex Hour and first sergeant Jerry K. Queen. Major sex hour served 23 years active duty service in the Army as a helicopter and airline pilot and if that wasn't enough then he decided to teach high school. He's been at Adairsville for 19 years and first sergeant Queen has been at Adairsville since 2011 and that is after serving 21 years of active duty military service in the Army and he primarily was an engineer in the light airborne unit. The Adairsville High School JROTC program was established in 2005 and is one countless awards during its 19 year existence. The ROTC program has been academically accredited and awarded and honor unit with distinction sits its inception in 2005 and this program provides hundreds of hours of support in the Adairsville community and annually conducts over 30 color guards honoring our country. And it's veterans. The Adairsville High School JROTC drill team is one of the top performing teams in the state winning 31 state championships since 2008. The Adairsville JROTC Raider program has proven to be the top performing Raider program in the country winning 15 state championships and eight national championships since 2014. In just in 2023 the Adairsville Raider teams had the most successful season in the history of the program. Female state champions, male state champions, female all service national champions, male team all state all service national champions and our male team finished the season undefeated. At the inaugural US Army cadet command Raider nationals at Fort Knox, Kentucky, the Adairsville JROTC program competed in the largest Raider competition ever with 295 teams representing 35 states. Our female team, they were the Army nationals runner up and our male team were the overall male national champions. And if that wasn't enough, each of the 14 young men who participated in that Raider competition and were national champions, they each received a four year scholarship offer estimated at $150,000. These young men and women not only spend countless hours in the classroom, their magnet students, they work hard in their AP courses, but they can be found practicing in the mornings and the afternoons in the evenings late at night. And during the hot July summer, they push themselves to extremes that they never thought were possible. You would be hard pressed to find students who are more dedicated to their school, to their program and bettering their community than the Adairsville High School JROTC cadets. Thank you to Representative Skoggins for providing us here this opportunity and to the cadets in the gallery. You represent Adairsville well and for that I am very, very grateful. Thank you again. Colleagues Raider, were you pleased to stand? Thank you, Colleagues. Thank you. Congratulations, JROTC boy, what a great group and what some great accomplishments. Show you what hard work I do for you. We'll move on to our morning orders. Representative Marin, you can, you're in, we won't make you sit down and get up. Representative, gentlemen feel, suspend just for a minute. Okay, Representative. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Good morning. I want, I'm standing up here today to congratulate and commend the Liga de Campeones program. It was developed by Univision 34 Atlanta and the Liga de Campeones program has been an entire part of the Hispanic community in the state of Georgia since 2004 and has provided scholarship to more than 150 high school seniors and students. This remarkable initiative represents the collaboration between Univision 34 Atlanta and local businesses, corporate partners and the community at large to support the aspiration and achievement of future leaders. The program's selection criteria emphasize factors such academic achievement, perseverance, sincerity, unselfishness, community service, financial need and any other characteristic. That, that, that, that word that makes the recipient a role model of their peers with that. I want the members to congratulate the members from Univision, Sancti Quasar, and Liga de Campeones would you stand and be recognized. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Thank you very much. Thank you. We love it when leadership groups come to the house. Thank you all for being here and appreciate what you're doing in the community. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Hawkins. Chairman Lee Hawkins has recognized for a morning order. He's bringing some friends with him, I believe. All right. Good to have all of you. Wait a minute. You got some more coming. Wait a minute. You have one more. I don't care what Matt said about your mind. I think you're ready now. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Today I would like to recognize the Georgia State University of Legislative Health Policy Certificate program and the Advanced Health Policy Institute. As you see, the legislators stand with me. We've all taken this policy program over the years. This is a very thoughtful and thought provoking group from Georgia State. They provide information that does not promote a political position, but rather information which allows legislators to make informed decisions on health care policy. If you're up there, would you please stand? There you are. Thank you all so much. You made a big difference in our way of thinking and our approaches. Thank you. Thank you members. Appreciate you all being here. Appreciate that leadership as well. Representative Adina is recommended. Recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Colleagues. The spend just for minutes. You have some friends coming that will join you. We'll give them a chance to arrive. Good morning. I'd like to recognize a visitor in the house all the way from Lagos State, Nigeria. Mr. Germain, so on a loo. He is the executive assistant to the governor of Lagos State, which is the third largest economy in Africa. He is here visiting on a four city tour and he stopped here first in Georgia because he understands that we do business in Georgia. He is looking to connect with Georgians, not just the city of Atlanta, but the state to do a state-to-state relationship. I'd like to welcome him. He's up in the gallery. Please give him a round of applause for being here. Along with him is the Echo Club President and local organization here. They connect with the diaspora here. They're also here locally doing a lot of philanthropic work in Georgia. I'd like to also recognize them. Thank you for being here. Echo Club, Atlanta. Thank you. Chairman Dumnick is recognized for a morning order. Chairman Matt Dumnick. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, you have a book on your desk for any of those of you who need help reading this Chairman Chocus is going to lead that just before nap time today. Today is Reach Out and Read Day at the state capital. This program's early literacy intervention began almost 30 years ago and is expanded to be in all 50 states serving nearly 6 million families, including 177,000 people. More than 1,000 pediatricians and medical providers have been trained in this evidence-based early literacy intervention program. And it offers each child an opportunity to be read to and to learn to read, helping place them on a path for academic success. Today, the very first pediatrician to implement this program in Georgia is joining us in the gallery. I hope that you will join me in applauding this champion of children for her 26 years of service. And additional Reach Out and Read Georgia team members here today, Amy Erickson, Dr. Terry Faden, Cammy Nale, Kim Thomas, and Carolina Klingker. Would you please stand and let us recognize you? Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Great to have you all in the people's house. Come back anytime. I'd like to appreciate what you do. Representative Carla Drenner is recognized for and morning order. She has some friends going to join her. Okay. If y'all will do that right now, that would be a good timing. Representative Drenner. Can all of the DECABB house members join us today? The CABB house members. Thank all of you. Mr. Speaker, we are glad to welcome today to the Georgia State Capitol. This is the cab day today. And the CEO, Michael Thurmond, is on his way over. He's not here yet. He was in the Senate. So we're welcoming him anyway. And just an interesting tidbit about the cabB under CEO Thurmond's leadership is the first and only Georgia County with the local sales tax dedicated solely to homestead property tax relief. Over the last six years, the cab has given back $700 million. And we just want to say thank you CEO Thurmond. But maybe he's walking in right now. Okay. It's not him. In absentia. Thank you, Mr. Thurmond. And we will see you in the anti room. Thank you. Please join us for the cab day down in the road. Thank you. Rifted Drenner, when he comes by, we'll recognize him as a former member of the house and certainly is his great service to Georgia. He's a good man. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You I'm feeling it. Listening. And has helped set up a calendar for him again. And now that I'm here to say a few words, is it obvious we enjoyed him, I feel like, felt it in our kids, was someone with other good fathers except just one brother and me and that one back tall children to him. Thank you, Jan. Thank you, Jan. Great service to your district and to the people of the state. Members, I'm going to ask you to stand with me as we recognize a dear friend who left us way too soon. Mr. Bruce Sims served as a doorkeeper in this house over 16 years. He was dedicated and what a nice man who always had a kind word and made us feel good about ourselves and about the word we're doing. Now we'll send you a notice out. Mr. Bruce will, his funeral will be Wednesday at the first Christian Church of Jonesboro, March 6th, Wednesday at 11 a.m. with visitation beginning at 10. And there will be a pitch-in lunch and Mr. Bruce would like that for the family afterwards in the fellowship hall. And he will be laid to rest on Thursday, March 7th at 11.30 at the Georgia National Cemetery in Kenton. So as we always do, our doorkeepers are so very, very important to our work in this house. And I know you guys have, as I have, we develop bonds with our doorkeepers as friends and as colleagues. And so we appreciate what they do for us. And certainly over the years, I know I was just talking to Cory, Cory Mokin. He said that Mr. Bruce had not felt well, had some mischievous health issues, but he wanted to come back and he did. He was dedicated to us and dedicated to this house. And for the memories of folks like Mr. Bruce, we can only just give thanks to the good Lord and ask his comfort be with that family. And if you will bow with me for a pre-forte prayer, I'd appreciate it. Lord, thank you for bringing folks like Mr. Bruce into our lives. The impact they make on us, the examples they set. Lord, we just give you thanks. Thank you for him. Ask your blessings on his family. Lord, just be with them over these next days. Jesus name. Amen. Chairman Tarvan. Is representative Buckner happen to be in the any room? Would you look and see, please? She's in this any room. Chairman Lomston. We have an afternoon order. I know we're surprising you're still in the morning, but we need to do the afternoon orders if you don't mind. You need the prop. Representing Debbie Buckner's recognized for an afternoon order. Members, if you'll give the lady in the well, your attention, I would appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Much first starts women's history month, and so I wanted to tell you an interesting story that involves flowers, women, and a horrific situation. One of the things that you may have noticed if you go up to the fourth floor is that there's a display case about the youth assembly. It started in 1945, but in 1946, there was a young man that was the son of a couple and he was an only child. And he wanted to be a part of the youth assembly in 1946 and come to Atlanta. And mom was nervous about it, but she said, I tell you what, you can go and you can stay with the kids and I'm going to stay at a different hotel. Some of you that know the history of 1946 in Atlanta may remember that that was when there was a horrific fire at the wine-calf hotel. It is still the worst fire history in America. Many of the students that had come all across the state of Georgia, the leaders from communities all across the state were staying at that hotel and they perished in the fire.

Rutledge Minics was one of those boys, one of those students that died in the fire. What's interesting about the story is that it didn't stop there, as horrible as it was, those students and the parents of those students worked and made changes across the nation to make our hotels safer. And now there has not been a fire that has ever killed that many people again in America. The mother and father of Rutledge Minics lived in Columbus and had a nursery and the nursery was named Minics Nursery. And they were known for their chameleus or chameleus, whichever way you say it, which part of the state you're from. But they are blooming profusely most places right now, it's the time of the year. They grafted and they perfected and this is the Rutledge Minics Chamelea. And it is a beautiful one that grows very well in Georgia. So Mrs. Minics, to me, is someone who needs to be honored and recognized in the women's history month. She not only sacrificed her son, unfortunately, in that horrible fire and may help make changes so it wouldn't happen again. But she also worked to make something beautiful to commemorate his memory. If you want to, on the third floor, there is a plaque that the legislature had put up in memory of all of those young people that were lost in that fire. Thank you, Mr. Well, you can't yield the will, you know, I have a question. Okay. I don't know if you can do that at this time of the day, but it's today, a special day. Particularly, it happened in December. It's just the flower was blooming in my yard. No, I mean, it's for another reason. Does it happen to be your birthday? Yes. That's all I wish, Debbie Bertha, a happy birthday. Thank you. Thank you, David. Happy birthday. And also while we're on the birthday, Wagon, Representative Terry Cummins has a birthday as well. Everything Terry Cummins, where is she? Two birthdays today. So we do have some, that completes our afternoon orders. We do have some privileged resolutions, Mr. Clerk. We'll year it to capture into a group of privileged resolutions. Recognizing commending, Shanika Maxwell, recognizing March 7, 2024 is Georgia Airports Association Day and commending the Georgia P-N-Industry in recognizing March 2024 is Georgia P-N-Montet State Capital. And for other purposes, that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions. The Zine Objection to the adopting of the privileged resolutions. Chair, here's none. The resolutions are adopted. Members, is there any objection to dispensing with a morning roll call? Here in None is awarded with a busy group of folks today. Busy group of folks. Morning roll call is dispensed with. From moving on to announcements, Representative Tran, Representative Long Tran. He's taking care of business downstairs. Chairman Knight, recognize for announcement. Chairman Knight. Chairman Knight's recognized. Just want to remind everyone, again, sports and sports caucus, we're going to have our range day for the sports and sports caucus this Thursday. Again, just want to put this on your calendar. I hope you'll come out and join us. I'll try to get more information about the exact time we end. But please come out and join us. Put this on your calendar for this Thursday. And I'll get more information to you. Thank you. That completes our announcements. Representative Tran, did you come in? We are here as announcements later. All right, everyone, have a good rest of your day. I know we have. If you have a page here, you'll need to come up for page photos. We appreciate our pages being here. If you need to take care of business downstairs, certainly. Hopefully you'll take care of that this afternoon and not in the morning. We'll get on with our regular order of business in the morning. Mr. Leader, you ready? The majority leader of this house is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this house stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, March 5, 2024. On the motion of the majority leader of this house stand adjourned until 10 a.m. Tuesday, March the 5th, 2024. All those in favor will say aye. Those opposed? No. It's very clear to me. The ayes have it. We are adjourned.
