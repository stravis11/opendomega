We're gonna start with it. I can't think of the word order. We're calling it order. There we go
See Mercedes, that's why I pay you big money. All right first on the agenda
Well first off is how's everybody doing today?
Does anybody have anything they'd like to share with the general public before we get rolling any big news?
Nothing
Man just lively crowd today
All right, well, let's get rolling
Is Senator Halpern here?
She is not she came last week. I'm gonna go a little out of order here on the agenda
But the rules y'all voted on allow me to do that
So we're gonna do Senate resolution
three fifty two and this was just simply she was supposed to be here she was
here last Thursday and I just didn't pay attention and missed it so this is
just commending Atlanta Public Schools on 150 years in service and that's it
it would need it does not there's no dates on there so we're okay so there's
there's no changes that need to be made.
Does anybody have any questions
about the underlying resolution?
Okay.
Senator Rat, what's your number there?
Make a motion.
All right, sure.
Got a, to move forward.
State your motion.
Make a motion that 352 move forward.
All right, I've got a motion that Senate resolution 352,
LC-127-0296.
Oh, this is it.
Sir, how is there anything you'd like to add?
I've already covered it for you.
Thank you, sir.
Do you want to?
Nothing else to add?
Do you want to grandstand or anything?
I don't.
I'll just say 150 years is a very long time,
and it's worth commending our Atlanta Public School system
for all they do for our students here.
So thank you.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's even 151 now.
All right I got a motion of do pass. I've got a second from Senator Jones of the
second Senator Jones. Any further discussion? All in favor say aye. All the
Opposed, same sign.
All right, motion passes, unanimous.
Okay, we're gonna jump back up to Senate Resolution
203, Senator Emanuel Jones of Henry County.
Floors yours.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
This is the Senate State of Committee
firearm storage. First of all, you said this is not a gun bill. It's simply information
that's been obtained across various sources. One being the American Academy of Pediatrics
on the number of kids that are, and I would move the data that's on here that I be allowed
to update it. Whereas on line four, it says 5.4 million American children, the latest
stated from the American Academy of Pediatrics is really 4.6 million and down on line
eight school students incidents up to 80% it is much closer to 74% according to the
data that I have, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee.
And also over on the very last page are move that the date on here, the Boschman date,
be changed to December 1, 2024.
questions? That's my job. Don't take it from me. It's all I got. All I got. Come on. Any
questions from the committee? All right. No questions from the committee. I can
covered it so well. Senator Rat. Okay, I've got a motion of due pass in a resolution
to zero three. Assumin, did I'm sorry sir. We'll take the motion first. I would need a second if
all right, sir and gentlemen, this is going to second that. Now, I would need an
motion to amend line 68 removing the number three and replacing it with the number four
to make it December abolishing the committee on December 1st 2024. I got a motion from
Senator Rat for that amendment, a second from Senator Jones, and...
Chairman, the rest of the question.
Sure.
What was discussion?
I was a little late to the meeting, but I apologize for missing that first discussion,
but I didn't fully understand the purpose of this study committee.
If I'm looking at lines 14 through 19, it looks like that's the meat of the study committee,
sure if that's something that we're going to spend thousands of hours on and thousands
of dollars of taxpayers dollars, I don't know if it warrants it or not. I'm just wondering
if the sponsor of the bill could elaborate more on what the purpose of the study committee
was. I'm not real clear.
Sir, I'll allow if you'd like to further elaborate.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for that question.
Georgia Laos is a response to safe storage,
and this is safe storage in regards
to protecting our children, particularly small kids
that are in the household where firearms are present.
And it's simply to see whether or not there's any changes
that's needed to current state law.
That's all that the State of Committee does.
So can I have your question on line 14, the current pediatrics screening protocols, can
you explain what that could be?
Absolutely.
Again, this is a protocol from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
They have a very extensive program and there is a handout that I can share with you that
highlights their website as well.
the pediatricians in their conversation with parents,
and of course, they're the frontline folks
who see these kind of incidents and accidents,
and of course, the injuries that are suffered by children
that have firearms in their home that have been stored
improperly, so they have taken upon themselves
as part of their directive
to have this conversation with parents.
So they are really on the frontline of leading this charge
as it relates to safe storage of firearms at households,
particularly as my children present.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
All right, hang on, Senator.
I want to get a question here
from my vice chairman, Senator Gam.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Look, I was a competitive shooter
in high school of college and very familiar
with what I considered safe storage
and carrying for firearms.
One of the things that for me,
I'd love to serve on your committee
if it does happen, said, but,
What do you really consider safe storage of a firearm?
I mean, you know, give me, what is it that what you're looking for?
Um, first of all, I am, you know, ex-military and I've been trained in the safety and, of course,
the care of firearms.
The only thing that I'm looking for is the support to work that's done by a pediatricians
to expand on that body of work to see if there's anything the state of Georgia can do to
certainly enhanced the work that they are already doing, to see if there's a possibility
of any laws that need to be changed, a tweak, to see if there's a way that we can reduce
those number of injuries that suffer by our children.
Okay.
All right, motion of table takes precedence.
So I got a motion of table from center of gouge, second from center of doles all,
all in favor.
Raise your hand.
One, two, eight, nine, ten.
I got 13, all opposed, raise, four.
All right, 203 is tabled.
I think we all are in favor of safe storage of firearms and I think we all know what that's
about and what that means and we trigger logs and putting you gun in a safe et cetera.
I do want to make a point that Senator Patrick is
introduced to be able to promote the use of farm safety
as far as sales tax break on trigger locks and gun
safes and that kind of thing.
So I don't want the general public to think that we are not
in favor of safe handling of firearms, especially when
their children in the home, but I think it doesn't marry at a study committee to know
what you need to do to safely store your firearm.
In our A promotes it, there are a lot of organizations that promote education and that kind of thing,
so thank you for the point of personal privilege.
So hopefully the 12 people watching at home won't think that.
OK, and thank you for your comments.
All right, moving on, we've got, we're actually
going to hold SR-433 per the author's request.
And I've got SR-443, Senator Kennedy.
This is the appointment of Rick Jeffries to the state election board.
You can do that from your seat.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good afternoon, committee members.
As our chair just said, this is about the appointment of the state election board.
The Senate elects by majority vote, and we have this by this resolution, we're proposing
our former colleague that many of us serve with Senator Rick Jeffries from Locust Grove.
He's a successful businessman.
He's got a long record of public service
and community involvement.
He's been a city manager.
He's been a city commissioner or a county commissioner
before he served in the Senate.
And this simply would appoint Rick Jeffries
to be appointed as a member of the state election board.
I'm gonna move for a second.
Well, before we get into all that, I'm gonna add
that is if his resume wasn't enough
to get him on this board. His desk is in the rules is in my office, that beautiful
desk that makes me look important, which we all know I'm not. So all right. I got a
motion. Who was the motion? Senator Anderson. Motion for Senator Anderson. I got a
second from center again. Any discussion. Here we go. All in favor say aye.
Aye. All opposed. Same sign. Motion passes unanimous. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank you to the committee for that vote. Good job. Good job. All right. Well,
We're going to call standing rules adjourned and we're done.
That's it.
Thank you all.
