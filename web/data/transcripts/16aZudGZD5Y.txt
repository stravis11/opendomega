So, as it provides for definitions, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary, that Committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee Substitute.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The House made some changes to Senate Bill 516 after we got some additional information from the Department of Revenue. The Senate did not necessarily agree with those changes, but we are very close to an agreement. We could just get the conference and work out a couple of details. Thank you. Representative Buckner has moved that this House insists on its position on Senate Bill 516. Is the objection? The Chair hears none in the House has insisted on its position on Senate Bill 516. All right. We're going back now to the supplemental rules calendar and the clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 798. House Resolution 798, the remainder of the 56th. A resolution creating the Joint Study Committee for Cannabis Waste Disposal and Recycling. This resolution haven't been referred to the Committee on Regulated and Series Act Committee recommends this resolution be adopted by Committee Substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Maynard to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is House Resolution 798. The State of Georgia has been doing a lot with cannabis and the plant of cannabis. We use just a portion of it and most of the plant is not used and so this is a study committee to look at all of the different things that we can do with the cannabis waste. And I would love your support in HR 798. I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? Chair hears none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The Chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this resolution now be adopted. All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does Representative Bentley rise? She wants. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of House Resolution 798. The eyes are 153. The nays are three. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 881. House Resolution 881 by Representative Jackson, 128 and others, a resolution encouraging each public school of the state to study the civil rights error and related subjects. Describe herein to affirm their commitment of the free peoples of the state to reject a bigotry. This resolution have been referred to Committee on Education. That committee recommends that this bill do. This resolution be adopted by Committee Substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Mack Jackson to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you House Resolution 881. I want to thank Speaker Rausten, Chairman Dave Belton, Representative Al Williams, Representative Matt Glanton, Representative Willway, Representative Chris Irwin, and Representative Carolyn Hubley for the work they did on this resolution. This is a fitting resolution to honor the teachings of nonviolence as taught by Dr. King. As most of us know, April 4, 1968, was the day that Dr. King was killed in Memphis, Tennessee. And this resolution encourages each public school in this state to study the civil rights error. There's no great authority under the structured nature of bigotry than there is to better cure than the work and philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his principles of nonviolence and social justice toward productive goals. We have a letter here from Mayor Andre Dickens, Supporting This Bill and others. And, Mr. Speaker, that's the gist of the bill, and I ask for your favorite consideration if there are no questions. You have a question if you care to yield. A yield. Chair recognizes Representative Holly up in the gallery for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does it gentlemen you? I do. I just want to thank you, sir, for working amongst his colleagues here in the spirit of bipartisanship, as well as having the faith to know that you can touch this issue and show that it is not a divisive concept, but it's certainly one that we've unified that there. Thank you. Thank you. You have no further questions. I yield a will. We have another member that wishes to speak on the bill that Chair recognizes Chairman Dave Belton to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I really appreciate the speakers' leadership as well on this really necessary resolution and also my relationship with Representative Mack Jackson and also Al Williams. It's easy to talk about the things we're against, but what are we for? In this award is for where if we believe Dr. King's nonviolent principles of social justice provide the best antidote to what is alien this nation, we also believe there's no greater authority nor a better cure than Dr. King's principles of servant leadership. Civility and tolerance have to be learned. They do not all of that could come to us through one generation to another. Our children need to learn the value of each and every human life. You know, Dr. King didn't cancel Thomas Jefferson. He celebrated our founding fathers. He invoked the famous promissory note based embracing the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. The Swiss Resilience is not just about the past. It's about celebrating the victory on an international scale that has a transcendent message of Dr. King. It's about teaching a new generation how places like the Prague Spring in Shackles of Acha, the White Revolution in Afghanistan, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the People Power Movement in the Philippines, the Solidarity Movement in Poland, the Singing Revolution in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution in Shackles of Acha. The Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the People Power Movement in the Philippines, the Solidarity Movement in Poland, the Singing Revolution in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution in Shackles of Acha. The Liberation of Bulgaria, the Golinod of Romania, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the most recently and most importantly, the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine in 2004 that gave those brave Ukrainians the freedom in their first place. These things did not happen by accident, were taught in large measure by the words of Dr. King. Missouri's a similar resolution, so as Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, I urge Georgia to do the same and yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The chair here is none, the Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none, the report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House resolution 881. The eyes are 160, the nays are zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. I ask all members of the House to please take your seats. All members please take your seats. Madam Doerkeeper. Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Brian P. Kemp and his guest, Wade Insurance, to the House Chamber. Madam Doerkeeper, please allow the Honourable Brian P. Kemp, Governor of Georgia and his party to enter the Chamber of this body. Madam Doerkeeper. Madam Doerkeeper. Members will please come to order. This House will come to order. All members will find seats. We are truly honored to be visited tonight by a special Georgian that has been a leader in this state now for coming up on three and a half years, I guess. Madam Doerkeeper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Speaker Ralston, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, Leader Burns and Beverly, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I want to thank you for allowing Marty and the girls and me the opportunity to join you at the start of what I'm sure will be a very quick rest of the evening. I will say this, Mr. Speaker. This House has governed through some tough times too, and your Governor is appreciative of that. Once again, we in where we started together, perhaps a little worse for where, after long nights of study and passionate debate since I first addressed this Chamber back in January. But no less dedicated to the hardworking people of Georgia that we are privileged to serve. I know you have miles to go before Speaker Ralston can officially proclaim signing die, so I'll be brief. But this has been a historic legislative session, and not just because of the unprecedented corniness of Don Hogan's daily jokes. In my state of the state address, I called for a teacher pay raise of $2,000, fully delivering on a promised array salaries of those leading our classroom by $5,000 in my first term. In addition, a $1.4 billion in direct funding for our K through 12 schools so that we invest now more per student than ever before. Legislations and sure parents have full access to their child's education, and children are not being exposed to obscene materials. The addition of 1,300 healthcare programs slots through USG, TCSG, and other institutions. A priority of this house, the expansion of Medicaid coverage for new mothers to the full year. Funding for a new anti-gain unit in the Attorney General's office, enabling legislation to give Attorney General Chris Carr, the ability to partner with the GBI and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute these dangerous criminals. An additional trooper class of 75 cadets in pay raises for our brave women and women in state law enforcement. Expansion of high career programs to include law enforcement and criminal justice degrees. Legislation to add human trafficking to the list of serious violent and sexual offenses that require superior court judge to grant bail. Something I know that our First Lady Marty Kemp and the girls in our especially appreciative are also want to thank them for all that they've done to advance this cause and how you all have helped them. And I've asked for other budget and legislative items that prioritize education, healthcare, and public safety. 81 days have passed since I delivered that address, and in that time you had delivered on every one of these items and much more, including a refund of over a billion dollars back in the pockets of hard work and Georgians. A gas tax suspension and a tax exemption for career military service members. And you delivered on truly something that is very monumental with unanimous bipartisan support along with your counterparts across the hall. The speaker's mental health parody bill, which I had the honor of signing earlier today. Congratulations. As I said at the bill signing with the passage of HB 1013 speaker, Austin, Spiro, Amber, their staff, representatives Mary Margaret Oliver and Todd Jones. And everyone in this chamber has truly made history. Congratulations again on that great achievement. It is yet another reason why people will talk about this session for years and possibly generations to come. So on behalf of the entire Kemp family, everyone on my staff and all Georgians, thank you for your leadership. But as always say, we must never read the book. We must not read the book. We must not read the book. We must never read the book. We must not read the book. We must not read the book. I'm looking forward to continuing to critically important conversation on the best ways to achieve an income tax cut for hard work and Georgians on fairness in school sports, divisive cons.

steps and I know you've got to pass that historic 23-budget chairman England. Thank you for your work on that. As our time together this session draws short, I want to especially acknowledge those who have elected not to return to this show that never ends. We're saying goodbye to many dedicated public servants, too many to name and full in each an institution in this historic place in their own right. But there's one in particular I want to single out. Dean Smirre, soon to be ambassador over the course of nearly a half a century working under this gold dome. You have broken barriers, both witnessed in May, Georgia history and as you told me early on you have been the glue that hold this place together. It's been an honor serving beside you, sir. You're a man of character and I congratulate you on a life and career well spent serving others. Thank you again. And Dean Smirre, Marty's a bigger fan of you than I am. In my state of the state I quoted Psalm 168, I've set the Lord always before me because He is at my right hand. I will not be shaken. As we head off into the rest of this year, I think those are good words of wisdom for all of us to remember. Good luck the rest of the evening. Keep chopping and God bless you and thank you for your service. I will back to order. Claire will read the the caption to House Resolution 1050. House Resolution 1050 by Representative Smith, the 70th and others of resolution recognizing, commemorating outstanding advancements and water conservation that have been made by Atlanta Metro Regents and all Jordan's. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Natural Resources and Environment. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Lynn Smith to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I bring to you today House Resolution 1050. When I was first elected to office my slogan about the Chattahoods you river was that you didn't need to see it, you could just smell it because it was that bad. Atlanta was polluting our waters all over the state and it was a very serious situation and we also entered into water wars with our neighboring states. So Atlanta had a crisis. I was there when the General Assembly began taking action to deal with this crisis. And so for over 20 years I have watched water policy evolve out of what I call the Corps IV, which was Chairman Hannah and Richard Royal and Tom McCall and then myself. We were the steady hands throughout this initiative. I'm the last one standing held in this baton. Our General Assembly works like a relay team. We reinvent ourselves every two years. And so the importance of this urging resolution is to tell you not to get comfortable because we've got a lot of rain and we're very comfortable right now with our situation. We will always have tension between our states and we will have periods of time when we have no water. The crisis can become very serious. Those of you who live in the metro Atlanta area need to one time go check for that tunnel that was built with a drill bit on a train track cutting through the granite to get to an old rock quarry in downtown Atlanta to have water two days worth of water supply for Atlanta. Our state was facing a very serious crisis around 2008. We were in a serious drought and then we had a judges ruling that threw us back to 1970 water use. I'm telling you all of this because it's easy to get casual when we have abundant resources. The urging part of this resolution is to remind you to always stay vigilant in this important issue. And secondly, to ask you to pause and take for a minute and understand in the urging part of the resolution that we are very dependent on our agriculture business in the state of Georgia, but we are becoming more and more removed from understanding the needs of our farmers. And if I ask you to explain to me what civil culture was and what marriage culture was and then talk to me about agriculture, I think some of you would have to pause and think about this. And so I wanna congratulate Metropolitan Atlanta for its 20 years of very diligent improvement of its water situation. They are good neighbors to all of us in our state. They provided us with data and information that was not the situation years ago. So I'll leave you to urge you to continue looking at our water supplies. The first few lines are about what Atlanta did. Starting on line 41, it talks to you about what the rest of the state did. There's a house resolution on your desk privilege resolution that lists in detail the water legislation. So think of this as a relay race. I'm the last one holding the folder, I'm Braille Vuitton. And I pass it to you the general assembly to continue being good stewards of our water resources. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield for questions. No questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You'll the well. Is there any objection? The previous question being ordered. The chair here's none. Previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of only adoption of House resolution 1050. The eyes are 164. The nasors zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to House resolution. 1149. House resolution 1149 by reps and a washburn of the 141st. The resolution creating the House study committee on regulation of affordability and access to housing. This resolution have been referred to. The committee on small business development, that committee recommends that this resolution to be adopted. Chair recognizes representative Washburn to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The legend gentleman in the House arrives to present House resolution 1149, which proposes the creation of a House study committee on regulation, affordability, and access to housing and further purposes. I think we all would agree that we see an awful lot in the media today about what is becoming a housing crisis in Georgia. I think we all agree that we see an awful lot in the media that we see a housing crisis in Georgia. We have a crisis of availability, affordability, and access to housing. And this study committee proposes a committee that will study that. It will be composed of four members of the House. The speaker of the cabinet, one of such legislative members is chairperson of the committee. It will have a real estate industry professional, a serving mayor or a county commissioner and another individual who at the speaker's discretion will be a serving mayor or a county commissioner. Legend gentleman, affordable, accessible housing is important to our citizens. It's a basic need of shelter. And it is also, in many cases, most of the time, if a house is purchased, it's a great investment for a family. It is also very important to our economy. The housing industry is one of the engines that drives the Georgia economy. And this is an important study committee. I believe it will be a balanced committee. And I think it will do good work in studying our situation with housing. And so Mr. Speaker, I urge a favorable consideration of this resolution, but I will yield for any questions. You have some questions if you care to yield. I will yield for some, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Dean Smirre to your left for a question. To the gentleman in the well. I certainly will, Dean. Glad to see you bringing this forward. The study committee is for affordability and housing. And we're going across the state, measuring this issue as it relates to affordable housing. Yes, so we are looking at affordable housing and another of other issues. Thank you. We certainly are. Thank you. Do you further yield? I'll take one moment, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative camp to your left for a question. Is this a gentleman yield? I will for my real to colleague. Well, I was doing some statistics trying to determine a need for this. Is it true that in the past 12 months from 4, 4, of 2021, houses under 300,000, there have been 66,000 houses to sell in the past year under that amount. And right now there is a mere 2800, excuse me, houses under 300,000 on the market. Meaning there's only about 15 days supply of houses on what would be deemed affordable. And $300,000, I'm going to say, is a stretch for a lot of people in affordability. Is that the purpose of your study? The purpose of our study is to ensure a number of things, private property rights, freedom of choice, affordability, and a number of other things. And I know that the lady is a residential specialist who does a lot of real estate business. And I'm sure she knows of what she speaks. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for favorable consideration of this resolution for a study committee. Tell them on his yielded the well. We have two other members that wish to be heard. Chair recognizes representative Mom to hand to speak to the bill or the resolution. Like Mr. Speaker, members of the House, in the four years that I've been a member here, I've never opposed the bill or resolution for that plan. And I come here today to oppose this bill. I think to maybe unmask what this resolution is actually to do. This year we've heard several things about affordable housing. We've heard how we've got to address this issue. How are we going to do it? We're going to do it through all sorts of things by restricting the ability of local governments and the Constitution authority that they have to provide zoning regulations for their communities. That's the power that's vested in them in the Constitution. But after that bill could make it the Senate Judiciary Committee or the House Judiciary Committee, we are here. We're right here today to study a bill or a solution. That isn't actually going to bring us more affordable housing for our workforce in Georgia. But rather do these things opposite. And that is to make housing less affordable under the guise of big congru-glombrates that are coming from out of state that are buying up every scrap of land in our communities and jacking up the rights on rent to where a working young adult in Pauline County who graduates from Pauline County High School, it is a welder. But goes for a local technical school. Can't even afford the rent that's there. That's who's behind this. In Pauline County, when I look online, the average cost of rent from the companies who have been behind this bus for is almost $3,000 a month. And when you ask them, how long can you rent for? They only allow you to rent for nine months before increasing your rent again. I've got too many constituents. I've got too many children back home from Kenna Ford House. And if we allow these big national companies to come in and steamroll every inch, there won't be anything left for our children. I would ask that you vote no on this bill. Will that miss Speaker, I yield the well? Gentlemen, is yielded the well that Chair recognizes to speak to the bill, Representative McLaren. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the last time. This is a promise from the heart. This is the last time. I'm not going to try to be as funny as it was or try to be funny, whatever, like last time. The reason I'm up here is my respect for the member from Pauline County. That's my reason for opposing this bill is a spirit that it's so elusive. But if we can hold on to it, we have it bipartisan agreement about something. The issue with this study committee is that it's a withdrawal from a step back from another initiative, which was to preempt local governments from regulating whether external investors could buy up a lot of land and neighborhoods and rent those properties out. And I'm with the Representative on this. The study committee is geared in that direction. Now, granted, we would love to have voices on that committee who can truly assess affordability. But all else held equal, we don't need to be giving that local preemption argument room to breathe. I'll keep it short. At the end of the day, I told you in my previous speech, I've learned a lot from being here, value the relationships a lot. This is a moment when I think we could do better on affordability, on affordable housing. This is not the study committee to do it, because this is in the direction of certain money and interests who showed up this session, put a lot of money into this, to try to get a particular outcome. And so the Representative and I agree, that's all I'll leave you with. It's been the honor of my life to serve here. And I hope to keep in touch with everybody and hopefully just be across all. Thanks, Mr. Speaker, you'll be well. Gentlemen, as you'll do the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerical, unlock the machines. What purpose does Representative Ridley rise? Secretary Quarry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the gentleman from Paul and County just stood over here earlier and said that he agreed that we should have a steady committee instead of making this a bill? Well, I was probably not paying as much attention as I should have to what he said, Representative. I know he's wasn't much breaker, but he did say that. What purpose does Representative Fry rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Secretary Quarry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that regardless of what people perceive the motivations of this committee is for, that studying affordable housing in today's climate is a good thing for this house to do. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All right, we'll do one or two more. What purpose does the majority leader of the house rise? State your inquiry. Paul and me inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that this will be a great opportunity to bring local governments together and have a discussion on this matter? And also, isn't it further true, Mr. Speaker, that one of the goals of every person is to own a home and isn't it further true that sometimes we have to rent first before we're able to achieve home ownership and discussing this issue and this study committee will make sure this issue is thoroughly motivated and all concerns are discussed and taken in concern for future legislation possibly. Is that true, Mr. Speaker? Well, that's the purpose of a study committee as opposed to having a bill, I think. Chair recognizes Chairman Burst Shit, what purpose does he rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true, Mr. Speaker, that there is a new concept of a whole subdivision is being owned by one entity. And when there are new concepts, it would behooves us as a state to study those things to see how to best take advantage for the citizens of the state of Georgia. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All right, final one, I've won't purpose this Chairman Rich rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that this study committee is to facilitate legislation that failed in both the House and the Senate this year and that had testimony from both affordable housing advocates and also affluent and struggling economically, economically struggling cities. Well, if the lady so states, I'm sure she believes that to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House Resolution 1149. The eyes are 114, the nays are 43. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to SR 135. SR 135 by Senator Mulles, the 53rd and cows of the 46th proposing a amendment to the Constitution of the state of Georgia so as to provide for sports betting in this state. This resolution having been referred to the Committee on Economic Development and Tourism, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. You rascal you, I didn't, you know, you were in this? What's your favorite game? Okay. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am a Baptist so I don't know that I could go there, but I do want to say first of all that SR 135 has nothing to do with gambling. If you have not read 135 on your desk, this is a substitute to reinsert the language that we had on our House Bill 686, dealing with the Forestry Severance Tax, where we're lowering it to 40% from 100% to create some fairness there in the taxation. That bill passes House 106 to zero, so I would greatly appreciate your support. Georgia's the number one forestry state in the nation and we want to make sure that we stay there and this bill will do this for us. So I greatly appreciate your support and Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to take any questions if there are any. Well, you do have a question, do you yield? Yes, sir. I'll yield for one. Chair recognizes representative Dreyer to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Okay. I just want to be clear that if this constitutional amendment has passed, we would be giving property owners, tax incentives to cut trees down. Is that right? No, the way it works when trees are ready for harvest and they're sold, they are taxed on the revenue that's generated from that selling of the timber. Currently it's taxed 100%. We tax all over other property at 40%. So what we're saying is that we will tax the landowner who cut the trees at harvest at the 40% level like we do everything else and then we'll reimburse the local governments for the difference to make up the 100%. And then the landowner is actually able to take some of that revenue that they put in their pocket and replant those trees back immediately. So this is a good bill to protect our forest, to keep folks planning them back after they harvest and provide fairness within the bill. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, sir. But they wouldn't have to get tax incentives to replant those trees if they didn't cut those trees down and start with, correct? Well, that's true. But if they don't cut them down at a certain point, they're going to, they're wither, they could fall, they'll be infested and it's good for our environment wants to have old trees, but also to have young trees that help the environment. So the older they get, they're not as viable as having those new young trees. And so that's why we think this is a good bill to keep in to play. So thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute to chair here's none? The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here's none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Al Williams rise? Oliver Jenquery. State your inquiry. Isn't that true, Mr. Speaker, that if these trees are not cut, housing costs will really take off. And is it not further true that if these trees are not cut, small landowners will have no income and no incentive to replant? That sounds like a fair statement to me, but I know the gentleman knows much more about that than I do. What purpose does representative Sains rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it not true that the gentleman who spoke against the process used by our hardworking timber harvesters was speaking from a wooden desk? You really want me to answer that? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of Senate Resolution 135. The eyes are 160. The days are six. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for past. Clerk will read the caption to SR 477. Senate Resolution 477 by Senator Mulles, the 53rd and Miller, the 49th, of resolution creating the joint study, the joint Georgia Music Heritage Study Committee. This resolution haven't been referred to committee on Creative Arts and Entertainment. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate Resolution 477 is a simple bill. It just creates a joint study committee with the House and the Senate to study the economic impacts of music, music tourism, tour production, and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. It's a simple bill and I think it addresses an important issue in our state in regards to music and the all.

the musical talent that we've had. The best part about this bill is lines 5 through 8 that discuss not only Otis Redding and James Brown and Little Richard but Usher, Outcast and Young GZ. And with that I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Chair. If all members voted, if so the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of Senate resolution 477. The eyes are 159. The nays are four. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 89. Senate bill 89, Senator Milo the 49th, albors the 56th and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 2, title 21 of the fiscal to Georgia and tentative relating elections and primaries generally. So it's a revive for a chief elections assistance officer. This bill haven't referred to the special committee on election integrity that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The mayor's chairman Gunter to present the bill. There we go. All right thank you Madam Speaker. Senate bill 89 is a election bill originally. It was stripped out and was replaced with a greatly modified version of 1464. So I want to go through the bill with you explaining the differences in it. Section 1 is a clarifying who the members of the performance review board are. Section 2 requires that ballots are securely stored in sealed and locked containers accompanied by a ballot transfer form. The state election board is required to permeate rules and regulations regarding the security and handling of unused security paper. Section 3 is the provision where employers are required to allow their employees to go vote in early voting or in the election. Section 4 and 5 remove the language of sealing the election documents. This makes it so that you don't need a court order to go look at the documents when they're stored with the custodian or the clerk of the court. Section 6 is that provision where these documents are deposited with the custodian or the clerk and how they are to handle them. They're holding for 24 months and they're to do it in a manner so as to prevent the ballots from being altered amended damage modified or mutilated. In addition to that there is a provision added 8.1 on lines 161 through 163. Upon certification of all matters on the ballots and a particular election all such documents from the election shall be subject to inspection pursuant to 21272. That's a old statutes been on the books since the 1933 code or some version of it but it sets out the parameters for which an inspection can be done. Section 7 is the original jurisdiction for the GBI. In that we modified that a bit to state that the investigation that the GBI would have authority to investigate violations of chapter 2 of Title 21 involving elections which if established are sufficient to change or place in doubt the results of the election. Section 8 is the subpoena power provision that we had in 1464 before and Madam Speaker I'll take any questions. You have some questions the chair recognizes representative McLeod for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Are you? Do you disagree with the Secretary of State who said that the 2020 election was a secured one? You disagree with your Secretary of State? I don't recall him saying that. Yes he did. Do you further yield? Yes. Will this create additional burden to our counties? I would think not. This is like I said greatly modified from 1464. A lot of the chain of custody provisions all of that is out of here except there is the C. I think the only place in it is Section 2 where it puts it for the state election board to work those details out. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. So are you sure because are you sure that the election supervisors agree with this bill that it will not cost them any more issues in their county? The ones that I spoke to at the last meeting that was their assessment. The ones that you spoke to. Yes. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Williams for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Are you? Is this not the same bill we passed out of committee this morning? It is. There was some it was there not some election supervisors there, directors of elections who approved this bill and was favorable for it. They were in on talking about some of the issues of the bill. That is great. And I appreciate your hard work and leadership on this. Chairman, thank you very much. Thank you. Great bill. All right. Madam Speaker, I yield the bill. Gentlemen, is yield to the well? Chair recognizes representative Clark to speak to the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise to ask you to vote no on this bill. First, let's talk about how we got here. As the sponsor just stated, this bill started as HB1464, which was a 39 page bill that no one asked for, including the governor, that would have put a bunch of unfunded mandates onto our county election boards and expand the powers and duties of the GBI to include investigating elections violations. When that bill was heard in the House, election officials were not really given a good opportunity to speak on that bill before it was rushed through and passed out of the committee. However, by the time the bill made it to the Senate, election board officials from across the state rural election board officials, metropolitan Atlanta election board officials, Republican election board officials, Democratic election board officials, all of them or many of them made their way to the Capitol to make their voice heard. Since they are the ones who have to implement these requirements and pay for these requirements that are in this bill, I think it is very important that we consider their perspective. And before I talk about that, I want to talk about who came. We had election board officials from Bartow County. We had election board officials from four-site county. We had election board officials from Macon Bib, Newton, Henry, Hurd, Athens Clark, Chatham, Fulton, all over the state. After hearing from those election board officials, again, these are the people who have to run the elections in their county. After hearing from them, the Senate completely removed all of that damaging language from HB1464. After listening to the people who run elections, they removed the language and then we turned around and put it into another bill. So you may not care about my perspective on this bill, but do you care about the perspective of the vice chair and GOP appointee to the four-site county board of elections, Joel Nat, who stated in the committee in the Senate that this language is very damaging and would cause him to lose poll workers. It's already hard enough to recruit poll workers. This bill will make it worse. It will make it harder. Why are we doing this to these election boards officials that are asking us nicely? Please do not do this. Why is it that our colleagues across the Rotunda can listen to the election board officials, but here on the house side, we have decided that their voice does not matter and we're going to ram this through anyway. Additionally, this bill will shift the duties of investigating election violations from the state elections board to the GBI. This is an intimidation tactic. It will not only be used against your voters, but could also be used against organizations and those county election boards officials or their workers. Again, they already have a hard enough time getting poll workers and now you want to sick the GBI on them? What are we doing here? I am asking you to vote no on this bill because I listened to the election board officials from across the state. The election board officials that run the elections in your counties and they said do not do this. Ladies and gentlemen, please vote no on this bill. If we want to do this, let's hear from them. Let's hear their input and put something together that actually uses the voices of the people that have to implement elections. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies yielded the well. The chair recognizes representative Wynn to speak to the bill. Thank you Madam Proton. It's April 2022, our last day of session and here we are still rehashing an election that was held in November of 2020. Over the weekend, I along with many of you received emails from Georgians who are still asking us to decertify the results of the election. So I want to try to be short here because we have rehashed this over and over and over again. The governor promised no new election bills. He just came into this chamber and when he talked about his priorities, I did not hear him say we got a pass an election bill. You all were there. You heard the same thing I did. To the Senate vetted House Bill 1464 and heard from a bipartisan group of election officials and they declined to pass it. In this bill, it contains many of those same provisions. It was heard in committee this morning at 8 AM with no public comment. So I'm not sure how some members were able to hear from election officials but when I watched that committee meeting, there is no public comment. And those same election officials who told the Senate that they did not want House Bill 1464 did not have the chance to speak this morning. And so here we are on the last day of session with a bill that a lot of folks really don't want to pass and it's a bill that will not restore faith in the election system. I have a couple of ideas how we can do that. One and two are pretty simple. One, stop passing legislation predicated on the big lie. Two, stop running campaigns predicated on the big lie. Three, we should actually all agree on this. Equip and resource our local election boards with what they need to run free, fair and efficient elections in their jurisdictions. This should really actually be logical because we have heard from election officials all across our state and they are trying right now to follow the guidelines that this body passed under Senate Bill 202. They are getting ready for elections that will happen in just a couple of weeks and many of our members are going to be on that ballot with new redistricting maps. And election workers are quitting because of threats, because of mandates and because of lack of resources. We know that this bill will further burden our election workers and guess what we are not funding any of these mandates for our local election boards. And we are facing an election administration crisis and we are making it worse. And finally, let's not militarize our election system. Giving power to the GBI will not restore confidence and in fact it may cause intimidation to local election boards, officials and to voters. The state election board already has investigative powers in the expertise to look into any cases or allegations. This is also physically responsible because in our state budget somehow we have found over half a million dollars allocated in this budget to fund positions for GBI to do something that we actually don't need. And somehow we can't find funding for our local election boards. So we are going to keep going down this road and it has no end because nothing you will do short of overturning election results of 2020 will satisfy a base that cannot accept that. And I want to close with a quote from the Bartow election supervisor who was very clear about this bill. Joseph Kirk said, focus should be on improving the voter experience. Not strange procedural steps to make a small portion of our population feel better about an election that happened two years ago. I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. The chair recognizes representative Hutchinson to speak to the bill. Thank you Madam Chair. Okay I'm going to be honest. I had to go home this weekend to New Orleans. It was my aunt's 80th birthday and we have a great party no matter what the occasion is. So I was partying all weekend. Yes. So I had to plagiarize my speech. So I was looking for quotes or something to inspire me because goodness knows we have talked about everything when it comes to voting rights on both sides. I really honestly just didn't know what to say. So I plagiarized. So here's some of the things that I got when I googled it. When dealing with explicitly enumerated rights but we need to is a weak argument from the get go. It is especially weak when it is untrue. Talking about the big lie. It's an explicitly enumerated right but we need to restrict it for something that was not true. This was a safe election according to both sides of the aisle. Here's another one. We believe that it's a basic human right to vote. It is a privileged vote. It is our job as the people to make sure that voting is in the right hands. Here's another one. Just think about when we fight to defend our rights and our voting rights especially when they are so often under attack. Well my friends let me tell you our votes are once again under attack. They are trying to take away our rights to vote which is enshrined in our constitution. Here's another one. We always have to fight for our rights whether we do it at the ballot box or we do it at the general assembly. Here's another one. Every one of us shares the same core convictions, core convictions no matter what they are. I have some of those same core convictions convictions that our founding fathers did. They believe that every man and woman had a right to vote. My core condition goes back to what our country was rooted on. What our foundation is rooted on. Our rights come to us from God not lawmakers. It's God who gave us our rights. Our founding fathers believed that. They talked about it. When people try to take away our foundational understanding that this was a nation founded under God we always have to fight to defend that because that's the core of what they're trying to do to take away and undermine our values. Now I have to give credit to the people who I plagiarized from. The first person I plagiarized from was the NRA. I plagiarized from the NRA because they know how important gun rights are because it's a constitutional right. Am I correct? It's a constitutional right and talking about gun rights and gun safety is a non-starter at best. I don't understand. I honestly don't understand. I came here as a social worker, not a lawyer. I still don't understand why the constitutional right of carrying a gun cannot be touched under any circumstances or according to the NRA the militia is going to come if we do. But our voting rights which is also a constitutional right can be messed with at all times. Also my uterus but that's another bill. I just wonder some of my colleagues who will not even discuss gun rights how they would feel if the GBI is watching you when you buy a gun or the GBI is watching you to make sure you use your gun correctly. I have a feeling that would not fly here. However here we are attacking the voting rights again and now we have the GBI involved as well. So I really really would like someone to explain to me which rights are more important in the Constitution. Is there a rank that I'm missing? Because I just I still don't understand and with that I'll yield the well. The lady is yielded the well the chair recognizes representative dryer to speak to the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. I want to be really clear on the most important thing here. You are giving the governor of the state of Georgia the power to seize ballots while they are being counted. That's what this bill does. Look lines 227 and 228 gives the GBI additional jurisdiction to investigate elections. Line 240 to 244 that's where the problem lies. You're giving the GBI the power to issue subpoenas to seize documents and electronic media. So if the GBI identifies potential election fraud the GBI can now issue a subpoena to go grab ballots while they are being counted. But how does that relate to the governor? You know who fires and hires the director of the GBI right? It's the governor. It's the governor. So we saw with the last president when there was an investigation into campaign issues there were two FBI directors that were fired. But what we're doing here is we are authorizing the executive branch of the state of Georgia to metal and our elections. It's separation of powers. I know some of you are going to sincerely tell me this governor is not going to do that. Okay maybe what about the next governor or the governor after or the governor after that? And even if this governor is not going to do that I don't trust him with that power anyway. We talk about separation of powers under the Constitution but what we're giving the governor the power to do is to stop the counting of ballots if the governor sees exit polls that he doesn't like on May 24th of this year. Six seven weeks from now if the current governor thinks he's going to lose his primary challenge to David Perdue he can order the GBI to seize ballots and voting machines in certain counties. He can also do that in November of this year or our next governor she can do that in four years and a few months and you are authorizing that power. There is nothing compelling to the point that it would have us wave our right as a separate but equal legislative body and give the governor of the state of Georgia the power to overturn an election through the GBI. I got to tell you that is too much power for anyone to have when it comes to our elections and instead of looking at how we can make voting better we're looking at how to give this governor too much power. I'll tell you we can solve the issues with voter registration simply do what other states do and guarantee that not one of us has another constituent that loses the chance to cast a vote because they're not registered or their voting registration got purged we can do it very simply by allowing same day voter registration. Second thing we can do is we can make sure not a single constituent loses the right to vote because they're at the wrong precinct often not because of their fault because it's been moved or combined or some other reason by letting people vote at any precinct in their county on election day and we've been pushing those. Why are we afraid of what people are going to tell us at the polls? Why are we afraid of everybody voting in our state? Is that because some positions aren't popular? Is it because we don't trust people? Down deep? I trust people. I challenge you to trust people to make the right decision because a lot of people are happy making decisions for other people but you would never let someone else make a decision for them. Finally, finally, finally, do not authorize the governor of the state of Georgia either this year or in five years to overturn their own election for no reason. Please stand up for the Georgia Constitution, stand up for separation of powers. If you have to walk, take a walk but please don't vote for this bill because if we're ever in a situation where there's a governor that's willing to abuse the powers and that's going to happen.

Happen to believe me. We've seen it. Then we're done at that point. And then you're gonna have some really mad constituents. I tell you. Thank you, Madam Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. For what purpose does Representative Cannon write? To make a motion. Statue required. I move to table this bill. The lady has. The lady has moved that Senate Bill 89 be tabled. All members who are in favor of tabling Senate Bill 89 will vote yes. All those who opposed tabling Senate Bill 89 will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the lady's motion that Senate Bill 89 be tabled. The yays were 68. The nays were 96 and the motion has failed. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here is none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to? Favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. The chair will take one parliamentary inquiry for what purpose does representative Williams rise? Just parliamentary inquiry. Madam Chair, Madam Speaker, is it not true that I was chief registrar in Baldwin County for 16 years? Chair expects the member to believe that to be true. And I was in many elections. And this morning I was in the committee meeting and the election supervisor Joseph Kirk from Bartow County was brought up to the table. And he discussed with legislative council chairman Powell myself and he was very fine with this bill. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The days were 96th and days were 69. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 338. Senate Bill 338. Senator Burke, the 11th, I'll start with the 50 second and others to be entitled to amend Article 7 of Chapter 4, Title 49 in the fiscal to George annotated relating to medical assistance generally. So it's increased postpartum coverage under Medicaid from six months to one year following birth. This bill will have referred to the committee on Health and Human Services. That committee recommends this bill. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Members of the House, I bring you Senate Bill 338. This would have Medicaid cover mothers from the postpartum period following their delivery for 12 months instead of the six months which we have now. We are still having a problem with maternity mortality and many of the illnesses are not found in that first six months period. Consider what it would be like if you had grown up without your mother. Madam Speaker, with that I will yield the well and ask for your consideration on this bill. Thank you. The ladies yielded the well. The chair recognizes Representative Cannon to speak to the bill. Thank you very much. I am proud to support this policy because I, like other Black women in this chamber, have been working on this bill for years. Let's get into what happens when a recently pregnant person dies. There is an option to fill out a box on the review form for pregnancy related and pregnancy associated deaths as to whether or not discrimination was a part of the death. As of right now, our health agency, the Department of Public Health, does not yet have what they need to make conclusions on whether discrimination was identified as a contributing factor. DPH said results should be interpreted with caution due to the high number of missing information. More robust data is expected in the future as the maternal mortality review committee continues reviewing. You see, we are one of the worst states in this country for childbirth. The mortality rate, both for mothers and for children. I would ask for your attention in this chamber as we are talking about Black mothers dying. I like this bill, but it's just the tip of the iceberg because pregnant people in our state deserve more. They deserve a doula, a certified childbirth educator, and someone who can assist with breastfeeding. The current biggest obstacle for accessibility to childbirth workers is cost. The Council of State Governments of which I am a Henry Toll Fellow reported that doulas have been proven to improve the birthing experience. By minimizing hypertension, epidural usage, instrument assisted delivery, and time in labor, I am here to say that this measure is good and that I am proud that our legislature will significantly help mothers by expanding Medicaid for one year to cover this necessary childbirth expense, but don't get too comfortable. Families are suffering without coverage when their loved one dies within one year of childbirth. So far legislative action to increase accessibility to doulas has been happening in southern states like Texas and in Florida, as well as in states with better health outcomes such as New Jersey, Maryland, and Rhode Island. Georgia should not lag behind these other states in giving mothers safer childbirth options. When we don't offer mothers the maximum coverage up to one year, they need to safely bring another human into the world, we gamble with their lives. This bill is a first step, but it is not doing enough. Other states have given us models for common sense legislation such as paying doulas a livable wage, but we must take this initiative and add to it just like we did last year. By adding six months, we need stronger legislation to protect our most medically vulnerable citizens. I urge you to show that Black Mamas matter and vote yes, trust Black women, and show up for reproductive justice. Thank you, I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. The chair recognizes representative Shannon to speak to the bill. I rise to speak in support of this bill. I'm glad that we're seeing this bill, but I just want to talk a little bit about the history of how we came to expand postpartum Medicaid in Georgia. For many years now, we had seen reproductive justice groups talk about the need to expand Medicaid and also the need to reduce maternal mortality. We've had some of the worst rates internationally, and for a long time, Georgia has been on the list of having rates that are extremely high of maternal mortality. In 2019, when this house was moving to ban abortion, I was a first to sponsor a bill to expand Medicaid for those who have just given birth. It was House Bill 693, and it asked this General Assembly to expand postpartum Medicaid for up to her year. The reason why I feel that, or the reason why I found that bill is because we know that maternal mortality tracks those who have died due to complications from carry-in pregnancy, both while giving birth and up to a year after giving birth. The representative from House District 58 got the fiscal note for HB 693. And then at that point, we assembled a group of legislators who worked with reproductive justice organizations to bill support for the idea locally. Former Representative Abel Mabel Thomas was instrumental in helping us bill support for this. Over the course of a year, reproductive justice orgs met to build public awareness about the issues of maternal mortality and to also bill support and to make the General Assembly aware that we needed to pass postpartum Medicaid. Expand postpartum Medicaid. Former Representative Abel Mabel Thomas, the Representative from District 58, met with these groups nearly every single month. It was an entire coalition. I want to thank the budget chairman who, from the first time I had a conversation with him about expanding Medicaid, he immediately saw the value in this idea, and he never just shut it off as something partisan that should not be considered. And since the time that it was passed, he has worked to make sure that it is included in every single budget, and I'm grateful for that. At one point, the organizations that were working on building awareness for this issue and rebuilding support for this issue, sent a letter that I delivered to the chairman, and I'm going to read it. To the Honourable Terry England Chairman, House Appropriations Committee, dear chairman England, this letter is from January 27, 2020. We, the undersigned organizations, are a coalition of concerned Georgians working to improve outcomes in maternal health. We request that the provisions be made in the FY 2021 budget to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage of mothers in our state up to one year. Implementation of this policy would be one of the many necessary steps to addressing the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis in Georgia. Data shows that Georgia has the worst maternal mortality ratio of any state in the country. Black women in Georgia are 3.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women are. And Georgia's own health experts believe that more than half of confirmed pregnancy-related deaths in the state are preventable. Based on the latest report from the Georgia State Mandate at Maternal Mortality Review Committee, 82% of maternal deaths occurred in the postpartum period up to one year. Yet women enrolled in Medicaid for pregnancy-loose coverage only 60 days after giving delivery. Children born to women who are covered by Medicaid during pregnancy are automatically eligible for Medicaid or Child Health Insurance Program for one year. Unfortunately, this same length of coverage is not extended to the mothers of these children. Extending Medicaid coverage of moms to one year after they deliver will ensure that they will have access to critical health care services and demonstrate that Georgia's values, Georgia values, health care. This recommendation has been made by both the State's Maternal Mortality Review Committee, as well as the General Assembly's own recently convened special study committee on Maternal Mortality, chair by Representative Sharon Cooper. We acknowledge the great strides in improving maternal health made by the General Assembly over the past two years, and we urge lawmakers to continue proposing and passing legislation that creates opportunities to achieve optimal standard of maternal health. These opportunities start with access to safe and respectful health care. Please allocate funds for extension of postpartum Medicaid coverage for women up to one year in the FY21 budget. Sincerely, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Center for Black Women's Wellness, Center for Reproductive Rights, Citizens for Community Midwives, Community Midwives National Alliance, Dr. Shalone's Maternal Action Project, Handmaid's Coalition of Georgia, Midtown Assistance Center, No Safe Seats, Sister Love, Sister Song, SOE Agency, and the United Way of Greater Atlanta. After the letter was delivered some weeks past, and we did see that postpartum Medicaid was expanded for six months on the House side. Again, I want to thank former Representative Abel Mabel Thomas who left her lasting legacy on the General Assembly by making sure that this bill passed in the Senate. She put her all into it, and as a result, we are saving lives. Access to health care is life-saving, and I'm glad that the state has recognized that it's life-saving for those who have just given birth. What I would ask is that we would choose to give access to health care for all low-income Georgians who need it, because it shouldn't be the case that the state is only primarily interested in saving your life if you've just given birth. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The lady has yielded the well. The chair recognizes the last speaker, Representative Bennett, to speak to the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise this evening in support of Senate Bill 338 in urge, and urge us, the House, to pass it unanimously. Did you know that 93% of maternal deaths were determined to be preventable in 2017? DPH has just finished a 2019 maternal mortality review committee, however the data has not been revealed yet. But we know from the data in 2017 that maternal mortality has a devastating point of 52% of pregnancies associated during that could be avoidable. We also know that 39% of the pregnancy associated deaths occurs 181 days up to one year postpartum as a mother and a pastor myself. I know that these issues impact not only immediately, but have long lasting impact and effects on communities and the family. The leading causes of pregnancy related deaths in our state are hemorrhage, followed by infection and cardiovascular disease and coronary conditions. Expanding access to Medicaid for pregnant families is the right thing to do. So I'd like to thank the members of Georgia Legislative Black Caucus who had this as a priority in our agenda when I served this chair. And I also urge you to vote yes to this bill, this life-saving bill. Georgia ranks number 55 now in our health rankings, and this will go a long way to saving lives and improving our health rankings. Thank you Madam Chair, and I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 142, the nays were 18. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk with the caption to Senate Bill 352. Senate Bill 352. Senate Bill 352 by Senator Thompson. The 14th alvers, the 56th and others being tied up now to amend chapter 143. The fish go to Georgia and Tate ruling the general provisions of professions and businesses. The business is so to provide for the issuance of expedited licenses by endorsement for certain licenses dispouses of firefighters. This bill that refer to the committee unregulated industries that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Martin to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Senate Bill 352 is going to be a path to help us to bring firefighters, health care providers and law enforcement officers to the state. All three of these professions are in short supply and it does that by allowing their spouses to get licenses through endorsement. It's just that simple. It lets them start with somebody that is practicing in another state moves into our state. They're able to start quicker and get a license faster. It simply does that if you're a spouse of a firefighter, a police officer or a health care worker. We've done this before for the military. It's simple. They have to buy by all of our laws. This just gives them a way to use the experience they've maintained. Madam Speaker, if there are no technical questions, I'll yield the well. And that's the house's favorable consideration on Senate Bill 352 to help jobs in Georgia. There are no questions. I yield will. Gentlemen, yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair heirs an and the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute. The chair here is not in the committee substitute. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is not in the rules committee substitute is adopted. to agree to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does representative Barr rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true, Madam Chair, that that presentation by that distinguished member of this body is the shortest in my tenure here? Chair expects the man to believe that to be true. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yays were 164, the nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed. The chair recognizes representative Smith for a motion. Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House bill 1291. Representative Smith has moved that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House bill 1291 to clerk will read the caption. House bill 1291 by Representative Smith of the 133rd and others being titled act to amend code section 4883. The official code of Georgia and Tate are relating exemptions from sales and use tax. So, it was revised to spend the threshold and extend the sunset date for sales tax exemptions. Chair recognizes representative Smith to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Madam Chair. House bill 1291 is the high-tech bill that we passed here in the House a few weeks ago by vote of 150 to 17. When it got to the Senate, they combined Representative Williams's bill, which was the data center bill and put it on. These incentives are used by the Department of Economic Development to draw these big industries here to Georgia and they have a great workforce and pay some great salaries in our area across the state. So, I certainly ask for your consideration and this agreement. Thank you, Madam Chair. There are no questions. And the gentleman has yielded the well on the gentleman's motion that the House agreed the Senate substitute to House bill 1291. All those in favor will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The yeas were 150. The nays were 16 and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House bill 1291. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 259. Senate Bill 259 by Senator Mulles, the 53rd, Gute to the 51st and others. We need to add an act to amend Article 4, Chapter 11, and Title 16. The Fish go to Georgia, and Title relating to dangerous instrumentalities and practices. So it provides various laws pertaining to firearms and the carrying and possession of firearms and other weapons. This bill will refer to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security that Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I bring you to Senate Bill 259. 259 is a cleanup bill on the firearms rights across the state. A lot of the issues that we had detected over the years on the Department of Public Safety and a lot that was brought to us by a lot of the members. And I'll give these to you quickly because the hour is getting late. Section 1, ladies and gentlemen, deals with correcting language that was created eight years ago dealing with houses of worship. At the time that we did, the Conceal Weapon Law at that time, churches and houses of worships were considered all-flemish to firearms. But the only problem with that was when we did that, we created a major problem to a lot of the houses of worship. At that particular time, and currently, a church must choose to either allow anyone or no one to care for a firearm. That's not correct. What we're doing in this bill is to allow that a church may choose who they want to bring, let it have a weapon in a church. You ask what's the issue with this? Open shootings. Churches have normally been considered a fair game to a lot of the criminal elements and people mentally unstable that want to do open shootings. Now I've been questioned, and this is probably one of the most interesting parts of this bill, but I've been contacted by people with son of dogs here in the chamber. A lot of the larger churches, and they say, well, we don't like that because we hire our own security teams. Well, you can hire a security team because most of those are law enforcement or post or trained or whatever. But you've got to remember that across the width and breadth of this state, there's a lot of churches that don't have the funds of the resources to hire security teams. And these churches have every right to choose who they wish, if anyone, to be armed in a church to protect that congregation during their meetings. That's what that part of the bill does. Section 2, ladies and gentlemen, this deals with probate courts. As you know, we just passed constitutional care, but there's a lot of y'all know that some of us have said that you should still keep a concealed weapons permit for this purpose of reciprocity with other states and for your purchase rights. This allows the probate judges to implement an online application process, and it also allows that renewals can be applications can be sent in by first class mail. Also the second part of that prohibits building a database of any license in the state. Section 3 deals with the 10 acre property. We have a situation, ladies and gentlemen, that 10 acres of property is in fact used by a lot of people to hunt on their own property or people that they wish to hunt. And what we're saying in that is that if you have 10 acres of property that local governments cannot ban you for discharging a file. You put specific language to calm the nerves of ACCG and GMA that has nothing to do with prohibiting zoning or anything else if they want to do it. It just says that if you have property, then you can hunt on that 10 acres. We had one of the members of the committee or one of the members who was in attendance the other day. When he heard this, he said, well, that's a thanks meet. He said, I have 60 acres. It was annexed into the city and I can't even hunt on my own property anymore. So that's what the 10 acre rule does, ladies and gentlemen. Section 4 deals with the disposal of the weapons. We have certain jurisdictions that aren't following the law today that says they're supposed to dispose of weapons that they have working weapons and legal weapons that they have confiscated. These are being built up in warehouses. Under testimony over the last few years, we've had a lot of the folks say that a lot of those weapons seem to always disappear from these warehouses. They're saying that they've got the law enforcement agency has to have an auction once every 12 months or when they get over five weapons built up and get rid of them, auction them off. But remember, they're not auctioned in these individuals. These have to be auctioned off to a federally licensed gun dealer.

Section 5 deals with the process of regaining your rights. And I would encourage you to read through that, but it's all the legal process. Once you've been agiticated either mentally ill or for whatever reason, at some point once you've regained or got control of your senses or whatever it may be, you actually have a right to go to court and to petition to have your constitutional rights restored. Section 5, Section 5, Section 5, Section 6 and 7 does exactly that. Puts it in sync with the federal laws so that there's a due process to go to court to prove that you are over whatever that condition may be. Section 8 deals with the state of emergency procedures. Basically, it says what the governor can and can't do and expands the type of the gun related actions of the governor or government official may take during a declared state of an emergency to include seizure of ammunition, reloading equipment, prohibitions on the manufacturer sale of transfer firearms. Your constitutional rights and legal rights are protected at that point. That ladies and gentlemen is exactly what this bill does. I would encourage each member in here to look at this. This is a very good bill. It's been worked on for quite a while. And this would ensure everybody's constitutional rights. I don't know that there's a need to answer questions, but I'll be glad to. So we can move on down the road and get some other bills taken care of. You've got some questions to you, you'll. Just a few and I'm very quickly, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representatives Stacy Evans to your left for a question. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. We were having fun while it lasted. Aren't we? Agreed? All right. I said we were having fun while it lasted agreeing on everything together, weren't we? Yeah, you made the court of the speaker. You made me a lot more intelligent. So I must be intelligent enough to be canning this bill. That's very good. See, it's working already. I actually just have an informational question. If the constitutional carry bill goes all the way through here and over there and there's been a couple of versions. So I'm not sure where we are, but the governor ultimately signs it. What's the impact on this bill? Because it seems like that bill would sort of swallow this and. Whole different subject matter. Nothing in this would be. Constitutional carry basically says that you if you are qualified under the Consil weapon, can carry a weapon without having a permit or anything just as long as you're not a felon, not a mental adjudicated as a mental health risk has nothing to do with anything in here. These are the working nuts and boats of the Second Amendment and Georgia or the firearms rights in this state. Thank you. Thank you. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. One more. Chair recognizes representative McCloud to your left for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So your solution to gun violence is more guns? I'm not sure of your observation about that. I don't know about gun violence. I've always said that the best friend that you can have when you're being assaulted by a criminal is a citizen with a weapon it knows how to use it. Is that a good guy with a gun? If you don't mind mumbling, I can't hear you. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. Is that the saying that a good guy with a gun is a good thing? Is that in the realm of what you speak of basically someone with a gun is I guess better than someone without a gun? Is that what you're saying? That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you want to exercise your constitutional rights and you're legally able to the net your business. We have that. Yes, sir. I agree. We do have a second amendment in our constitution. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I would certainly appreciate the member's favor of consideration. Let's get this piece out of the way to help. One is to ensure people's constitutional rights to adjudicate their cases in court and help these churches who have been and a lot of the churches have been prompted to disobey their own commandments on this on the current language. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, the other members wish to be heard on the bill. The chair recognizes representative Jenkins to speak to the bill. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I rise in support of SB 259. I want to speak specifically to section 3. That's a section that limits the ability of municipalities, counties, and consolidated governments to restrict the discharge of firearms on tracks of land larger than 10 acres. My family did farm in the city. We had approximately 200 acres that was annexed into a city with no track large smaller than about 60 acres. And we lost the ability to discharge firearms to hunt because at the end of the day one farmer can outvote a subdivision. You know, when a lot of times these cities don't understand the importance that hunting is to managing a piece of property. Farmers are the custodians of our green spaces. We appreciate these, but ultimately, you know, if you're conducting agriculture, you have to be able to manage primarily the deer populations on your land in order to get any kind of harvest. And, you know, our urban areas are full of farmers doing just that. And this gives them the tools they need. The Department of Natural Resources has set up a very good structure to our hunting seasons and all our rules to properly manage our wildlife populations in this state. But when these rules run up against these ordinances that prohibit the discharge of firearm and consequently hunting, then that doesn't occur. It's been over 20 years ago when I was last in uniform as a police officer in Clayton County, but to my surprise when I went to morning watch, you know, I found one of the first things I did every morning was euthanized deer on the loop road around the Atlanta airport. And, you know, some of the largest deer are in urban areas because there's no way to hunt them there. So, statistically, Henry and Fayette County are actually two have the most deer-related accidents because, again, these are urban counties with large, rural tracks in there and so many of them are closed to hunting. So, in conclusion, I think the folks that brought this bill, this is a good bill. This protects our second amendment right. It allows particular urban farmers to manage their property and take care of their livelihoods. Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield the well. Chair recognizes to speak to the bill representative Becky Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise in opposition to Senate bill 259. I believe in safe gun ownership laws and reducing easy access to guns, not more guns everywhere. Section 1 deals with places of worship. Places of worship are sacred. They should be safe. I have heard the arguments that churches should be treated as private property. Places of worship are God's property. Guns are tools of violence. What is our fifth commandment? Thou shalt not kill. Guns kill. The current law works where churches specifically permit the carrying of weapons and long guns into the sanctuary. Current law allows for armed security in the church if the church wants that. Most churches do not want concealed lethal weapons in their sanctuary or long guns in their sanctuaries. Section 3 regarding these properties of ten acres or less. Current law works where the local municipalities or county or consolidated governments can prohibit the discharge of firearms on local properties of ten acres or more. They know their communities best. They have access to zoning information and know about future plans for recreational facilities and ball parks. They would be responsible for stray bullets shot from the barrel of a gun that might accidentally kill children on these properties. I also spoke with another member who owns properties of over ten acres earlier tonight. He likes to have the freedom for his children to run around on these properties. If his neighbor with ten acres or more is shooting guns on their property, that could put people on his property at risk. This bill takes away local control and prohibits local governments from that right and responsibility. Section 4, Unclaimed Firearms. When I told my husband at dinner about this provision, requiring municipal corporations to sell firearms once a year and if they don't for individuals to be able to sue them, he was asking me why? Why is this required? I didn't have a good answer. Now I've listened more and I hear what the chairman has said that law enforcement can sell these guns. But what I would say is current law works. They can do that now. Local control works. Most of the time they do have these annual sales. I understand that this legislation was written to keep a municipality from holding on to their guns for long periods of time and that guns may disappear and that proponents want these guns out on the market. But I want to ask the question, what if a municipality wants to decrease the number of guns on the market? How many guns are too many guns? How much is too much? Over 400 million guns in the United States between police, military, and American citizens. Over 393 million guns, 98% are in civilian hands. Equal to 125 firearms to 100 citizens. We have more guns than citizens in the United States. If a municipality wants to decrease the number of weapons on the market, they should be able to destroy them or to melt them down. You can save the guns of the antiques and special and then sell them and melt them down. Many municipalities do that in other states and we could do that here. Section 5667 dealing with persons with mental health, petitioning the court for a right to bear a firearm, these sections are good. They are an improvement over current law, which allows for a person who has been involuntary hospitalized to be automatically purged from the no-gun list. I wish that we could strip all other parts of the bill and keep these sections 5667. I want to take a moment to talk about what Georgians really want to reduce gun violence. I know we all want that in this chamber. I'm talking about safe gun ownership laws and reducing easy access to guns. I've told you about my church, North Decatur Presbyterian, where once a month, during our confession, we read aloud the names of victims of gun violence. At least 50 a month, murders, suicides, accidents. During the pandemic, it was closer to 100 Georgians a month, a thousand precious Georgian lives lost to gun violence. Wisdom, justice, moderation, and we just added courage. Many of these gun deaths are preventable if we have the courage to pass safe gun ownership laws. I was disappointed that on the public safety committees hearing on crime in Atlanta, we were never given the opportunity to hear from public health officials who every searched gun violence. I think we would have greatly benefited. I'm thinking about laws like red flag laws that prohibit convicted domestic violent abusers from holding a gun. I'm thinking about training of firearms and safe gun storage. Requiring training in firearms using safe gun storage could save hundreds of Georgian lives each year. But I went to DC this fall, my neighbor, my college roommate, Carolyn, told me about her nephew, Max Williamson, who was cleaning his gun in his apartment and it accidentally discharged. He went, the bullet went through the wall. He went to his neighbor's apartment and knocked on the door and no one answered. He left a note and went out of town. When he returned on Sunday night, he found out that the stray bullet had gone through the wall and killed his neighbor, who was also a mother. Now his young life is potentially wasted as he faces trial for killing this young woman. When my college roommate researched guns going through walls, accidents, there were countless stories of this happening. It doesn't have to be this way. For example, in hospitals, a lot of patients were dying of hospital-acquired infections. Doctors with public health background helped them figure out by following strict checklists and protocols for sanitation that these numbers could be drastically reduced. What if we applied the same level of detail and accuracy so that people were following a detailed checklist every time they cleaned their guns? And safe gun storage. I am so tired of hearing about children killing children with unsecured guns they have found in parents' homes and cars. I know many of you practice safe gun storage. Why wouldn't we want all Georgians to practice safe gun storage? colleagues, I asked you to vote no on Senate Bill 259. No matter how you vote, I ask that you ask yourself what can I do? What can we do to prevent gun murders, to prevent gun suicides, and to prevent gun accidents? Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Ladies yielded the well. Chair recognizes representative Park to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to strongly oppose this bill, Senate Bill 259. This is a dangerous bill because it will allow more guns into our communities which will increase the risk of gun violence. This bill puts guns before God. Literally, it strikes the words place of worship seven times on lines 48, 49, 55, 51, twice on line 52, 52, and on line 65 to 66 and 67 to 68. Striking out the words place of worship in Georgia law will allow anyone to bring a gun into your church in mind, in rural Georgia and downtown Atlanta, and impose an unnecessary burden on churches by requiring churches to put up signs that say guns cannot be brought into these places of worship. Because Georgia legislators in an election year thought it was good politics to put guns before God. Now, if y'all are so scared that you need a gun with you at all times, everywhere you go, including church, y'all need more Jesus. Do you know what the most frequently made commandment in the Bible is? Do not fear. 365 times. We cannot allow our fear to guide public policy in this state, especially when it comes to gun violence. Under current law, a licensed holder who brings a gun into a place of worship, a church, mosque, synagogue, or temple cannot be fine more than $100 and cannot be arrested. Under current law, if you're not a licensed holder and you bring a gun into a place of worship, it is only a misdemeanor per OCGA 1611127 subsection E2. This bill strikes out these minor penalties and state law on line 65 and 68. Now, I would argue that finding someone for bringing a gun into a church is not an unconstitutional infringement of the Second Amendment. I would further argue that the belief that the Second Amendment is absolute or that our founders intended that there be no regulation on the right to bear arms is a extreme, radical, misguided, and dangerous interpretation and application of the Second Amendment. Especially when it comes to firearms that can be modified to become semi-automatic-esque weapons of war that belong on a battlefield, not our neighborhoods or communities. Now, don't get me wrong. I support the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. I appreciate and value this fundamental constitutional right to protect myself and my family and as a safeguard against tyranny. After my family business was robbed at gunpoint around a decade ago, we got a 40 caliber glock to protect ourselves. However, no constitutional right, including the right to bear arms, is absolute. And certainly, a state law that prohibits a gun and a place of worship is not an unconstitutional infringement of the Second Amendment that would threaten our democratic republic compared to say trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power or a threat to this country such as trying to undermine the rights of citizens to vote. Like many other bills debated this year, this bill once again undermines local control. In Section 3, lines 115 to 119, it prohibits any municipality, county, or consolidated government from prohibiting the discharge of a firearm on a parcel of land that is 10 acres or more. What if this 10 acre parcel of land is next to an elementary school, a nursing home, a hospital, how many 10 acre parcels of land exists in the metropolitan area? Is it too much to ask members in this body to respect local control with the understanding that the needs of urban and suburban Georgia may be different to the needs of rural Georgia? Now, in Section 4 of this bill, lines 139 and 148, this section requires it mandates local governments to auction off any firearms they may acquire every 12 months if they obtain five or more firearms. How many local governments in urban and suburban areas likely have five or more firearms in their inventory compared to local governments in rural Georgia? I have concerns this bill will unfairly burden suburban and urban local governments and will increase the prevalence of firearms in more densely populated areas. If a local government does not hold an auction every 12 months, per line 142 to 143, a person simply interested in acquiring that firearm may bring a lawsuit, they may bring an action in mandamus or other proceeding to compel the disposition. The bill allows any interested person to sue local governments even if that person who sues a local government from a mandatory firearm auction doesn't get the gun. That's extreme. If y'all don't know, that is extreme. While anyone may bid and apparently sue local governments, lines 151 and 152 state that transfers of such firearms shall only be to licensed dealers and manufacturers. What do y'all think a licensed gun dealer is going to do with guns that they may obtain? Sell them, of course. And what do you think that's going to result in? This bill will put more guns on our streets, more guns in our communities and neighborhoods. As 70% of Georgians opposed concealed carry, I think it would be safe to assume that a majority of Georgians do not want to allow guns and places of worship and have more guns in our communities that increase the risk of gun violence in our neighborhoods. So if you want to do the will of the people, vote no to this bill. If you want to put God first, not guns, now is a time to demonstrate your faith with actions, not merely words. If you are pro-life and want to protect the life of all Georgians, if you want to protect your communities, vote no to this extreme, harmful and radical bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. We have a minority report. Have a minority report. Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip, representative Wilkerson to present a minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know we have a lot of important measures to take care of the budget, the tax bill. So I promise not to take more than 18 of the 20 minutes I'm allotted. I'm here today to speak against Senate Bill 259. This legislation is not needed. If you refer to your booklets, the minority party has filed a report in opposition to Senate Bill 259. We actually did that back on April 1st of 2022. The minority we disagreed with the committee's due pass recommendation of Senate Bill 259. Senate Bill 259 is more guns and more hands and more places bill. It forces churches to post, notice and file trespass charges simply to enforce the right to be free of firearms. It preempts local communities from attempting to keep families and neighborhoods safe by setting common sense limits on when and where individuals can carry firearms. Finally, it preempts local jurisdiction for making the choice in the best interest of their local community as to how to dispose of confiscated weapons by forcing auctions of five or more firearms. As such, we urge this body to vote no. And then in accordance with Rule 56 of the Clerk of the House, we file this minority report right here and we submit it to everybody. So many of you may ask, what is Rule 56? As we debate this bill, you may ask yourself, what is Rule 56? So Rule 56 is actually that all reports of the committee shall be in writing wherever practical. Each committee shall include an additional report on each general bill or resolution, a brief resume of the bill. And that's what we did here. We talked about what was wrong with this bill. And if the committee wants to, so order the Clerk's give a majority, they print it, they distribute it to the members of the House. And the majority of the minority of the committee must do it, but not less than two members may make in writing. So what that means, basically, if you have four people that vote, no, we have to get at least three. Now there's three Democrats and two Republicans. It kind of muddies it up a little bit because we have to get at least a majority of both parties. And that gets a little hard sometimes. So I've kind of explained what led us to where we are right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm the chairman of my good friend walk through the bill a little bit, but a lot's going on. We're really busy and we've got a lot to do. So I'm going to walk through it again if you're okay with that. Okay, so chapter 11 of title 16 of the Georgia code of Georgia annotated in the beginning. Now tonight you have to be careful because usually this tells you what the bills about. But today there may be some things like earlier. I thought I was voting a casino and it was trees. So I just want the voters to know that sometimes as we are making good legislation, the titles get changed sometimes. So I'm going to move into the bill because it has some things that change. We changed the definition of a place of worship. On lines 52 and 53 we strike out in a place of worship unless the governing body or 30 of the place of worship permits carrying a fire was by long gun holders. By license holders. And then further we we we kind of 65 through 68 we remove the fines. Oh, you're the majority whip tell me I lost my place. So I'm going to go back a little bit. So yes, 65 through 68 we struck that out and then on lines 79 though I am concerned about involuntarily. So we we removed the voluntary hospitalization and say as long as a person knows if something's going on and then you have to you force them into the hospital. Then this applies but if they go willingly even though they have an issue then this doesn't apply to them. 95 talks about the data base prohibition. The term multi jurisdictional to me to or more between among more than one department or agency because when you have

Multiguristicional, you know, it's multiple, it was kind of like, what was that movie? Eddie Murphy, it wasn't a 48-hour Beverly Hills Cop, it was a multiguristicional task force because it was multiple jurisdictions that were task-forcing together. So that's what that kind of means right there. So we move on to 115 and 116, the 10 acres and more. 10 acres is kind of random because I know in Cobb County we do have some pieces of land that could be right next to a neighborhood that have 10 acres. So the 10 acres is kind of arbitrary. We could have said 15, we could have said 5, but 10, I think, is very arbitrary. For a bill that's important, I don't think we should be arbitrary. We could have worked together to kind of clean up that language. I've got mandamus, mandamus, what's my attorney's? Mandamus? Mandamus. What's this school? Mandamus. It's like a rid of law, mandamus. Okay, so as you walk through the bill, you can see that there are some parts that people may like. As we move on to lines 206, I know a lot of people worked on that, but you can't just take a piece of the bill and vote on a piece of the bill. You have to vote on the bill all in totality. In totality. So I'm asking you to look at every underlying and added line and look at it together. And I do want to thank you all for walking through this with me. You're welcome. And as we go to the end of the bill, I think that pretty much covers most of it. Section 8 talks about ammunition reloading. And then, well, this is interesting. We move on to the prohibition of manufacturer sale of firearms in ammunition. So as the speakers before me said, this is not the time or place for this type of legislation. And that's why we've filed a minority report in accordance with House Rule 56. And I will ask you to please strongly consider looking your heart. Think about your family and friends. And I'm asking you to really think about what this bill does to George's and to vote. No. Mr. Speaker, I try not to take up the whole time, but I would yield any questions if there are any. Mr. Speaker, I believe there's no questions. I will yield the well. Thank you. Gentlemen, as you'll do the well. Previous question having been ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill or vote I? Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Okay. have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the eyes are 94 the nays are 67 this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for past chair recognizes chairman workhizer for a motion miss bigger thank you I move that this house adopt the conference committee on house bill 1425 chairman workhizer has moved

the three thousand foot barrier down to two thousand feet section twelve is uh... expensive testing of the product for potency foreign matter pesticides and other uh... related items section thirteen is protecting trade secrets and balancing what should be discovered to open records uh... in the clear ball that confusion we've had here recently section fourteen is the i guess the meet-up in the big change so as you know we've got uh... six folks out there who are potentially awarded a license that this allows the commission through using the department of the administrative services to review the scoring not to re-score but to review and then using the third party consultant to and then get back with the commission by June seven and then uh... wrapping it up all protest and uh... lawsuits will now go straight to the statewide business court and then the commission shall issue a new request for proposals for those other sixty three people provided that they drop their protest and or lawsuits and they'll be eligible to to apply for those three and fours and that's the bill our weapons to meet her yet so you got any questions ask him do you have some questions if you yield uh... do maybe one or two chair recognizes dean smirre to your left for a question to the gentleman you know you know yes sir you know we start talking about this the cannabis and uh... in the last bill we had now correct me on this one how many license or included in class one in class two i mean i'm in trouble license will be talking about it's going to be nine total so class one is is going to be the original two class two is going to be four class three which is the same as one is going to be an additional one and then then class four which is equivalent to a class two is going to be two so my math is right that's nine total licenses so so i want to make sure that the gentleman in the last bill we had there was six license two and four in both classification those stay those stay yes sir so this is a additional there and three more okay one last question fort valley and the university georgia were given discretionary power and and our last piece of legislation other words they had direct opportunity to go directly to the marketplace and partner with uh... with with the university or jorge kaparna and four valestika partner with with someone in the business to retrofit retrofit their area is that that that that's all that state in the bill okay and so far fort valley has participating university georgia it's kind of standing back on that right now okay thank you thank you very much this figure i'll take one more chair recognizes chairman pal to your right for a question parliamentary inquiry this is not a question that's you sir is this directed to the uh... gentleman yield yes sir i'm sorry i tried to look through this bill me too if the gentleman might tell me we knew that when we look through the uh... interview the cannabis commission there appear to be a considerable amount of concern that we had in the committee uh... that dealt with accusations that of those first six that were tentatively granted that a lot of them weren't eligible notably one in particular that stood out to me because they had a facility that was within the three thousand foot boundary of the current law and now i see in this bill on page sixteen line three ninety that you'll in this report that you'll have now reduced that three thousand to two thousand feet did you explain to me what that change was made for because the three thousand was close to a half a mile and we looked at comparison to even the alcohol which is a thousand feet this puts it fifty percent greater than that it was just from the beginning it was not to protect that whoever that potential protest he was uh... from the beginning that that number was too high the gentleman further yield yes sir i understand what you said but under the terms of the law that was passed three years ago that license work were supposedly uh... scored and graded on this company would have never been should have never been included for consideration by virtue of being outside the boundaries but with all the parents as it seems like we're trying to fix something after the fact that i have concerns is going to promulgate more litigation they will already know it's going to come would you agree or disagree to that well that matter what i think in a room full of lawyers uh... data term in that because this is a this bill repeals parts in the previous bill that sensors a brand new uh... bid process that that would go away just so it would not have an effect on any current lawsuit further inquiries sure all right we've created three new licensees so who will be eligible to bid on those three the other sixty three folks who who would not be awarded the first six and they would not have to pay a fee but they would be eligible uh... as long as there is a stipulation there that there is not a pending protest or a lawsuit from that company that would disqualify you so are you saying that a company can abrogate their legal rights if they don't follow up with litigation if they filed a protest is that what you're saying say that layman terms and we repeat that so you're saying that one of the sixteen protesters it would possibly be considered for one of the three licenses but are you saying that they can't go through that petition if they have filed litigation that is what i'm saying they would have to drop that if they want to be eligible for one of the three additional licenses i'm not an attorney but i don't think that you can give up your rights especially after a law has been passed in effect that another law was was not or the process wasn't correct thank you sir thank you and with that miss picker i'm going to yield the well and ask for your favourable consideration gentlemen has yielded the well on the adoption of the conference committee report on house bill fourteen twenty five all those in favor of the adoption of the report will vote i those opposed will vote no in the clerical unlock the machines what purpose is representative bote rise parliament inquiry

twenty two representative i have not read the conference committee report yet i'm that's why i'm not voting i mean if you gentlemen says that i have no reason to question what purpose is representative fryer rise you ways what purpose does chairman work eyes arise parliamentary inquiry to my friend uh... in front of me the reason those dates actually are not really any different than the previous in iteration we just moved it back because we're two years further down the road and we're actually looking whether those companies complied with the minority and women own participation so it's not that we're the land it were true where making sure that they do comply if they haven't complied the commission has a ability to assign a new license that does fit the women in minority own requirements okay have all members voted have all members voted all members voted what purpose is representative Bentley rise parliamentary inquiry mr. speaker is it not true that i believe that this bill would be very helpful to four valley state university which is the only land grant institution that's it also historically black institution for how you're learning in the state of Georgia is that not true what i believe i'm sure the lady does believe that what purposes representative camp rise parliamentary inquiry isn't it true that the longer that we delay bringing medical cannabis and having to do things that are not always legal to get the medicine they need to their children and family members uh... i think the lady uh... has spoken the truth all right final call have all members

need in this state and today tonight will finally isn't it true that we finally come up with a plan that is fair to all concern and isn't further true miss speaker this addresses a need that's a desperate need for the citizens of our state utilize this product that makes a huge difference in the health of the people of this state isn't that true miss speaker i believe that is to uh... true mr. leader all right have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of the conference committee report on house bill fourteen twenty five the eyes are ninety five the nasa seventy three and this house has adopted the committee of conference report on house bill fourteen twenty five chair recognizes i'm sorry the clerk read the caption to senate bill four forty one senate bill four forty one by senator hatched fifty thougt the fifty first and others being taught an act to amend title fifteen to go to george and is that a related to court in general so survived for the reestablishment of the criminal case data exchange board as an advisory board to the council of superior court clerks of george chair recognizes chairman gunter to present the bill thank you mr. speaker ladies and gentlemen senate bill four forty one revives the criminal case data exchange board we have a real problem with our g c i c documents uh... in the criminal court uh... when i served as a district attorney one of the first things that i faced coming into office was filing cabinets full of warrants that had no disposition on them these warrants could show up these warrants could show up if you got stopped for a speeding or something like that there was it doesn't seem at least when i was doing this that there was any one entity that made the entry of the uh... disposition of the cases sometimes it was a district attorney's office doing it sometimes it was the clerk's office doing it and the clerk's office would run into problems where you're arrested on one charge but indicted or accused on a different charge all in the same case it's a confusing complicated system and this is an effort to try and fix that now there's two additions to this uh... this bill sections ten and eleven ten is the uh... original jurisdictions for the g b i to investigate election fraud and section eleven is the subpoena portion of that that was tacked on to this bill urge you to vote for this bill uh... for the to clean up the criminal data in this state and i'll stand for any questions if you have any you do not have any questions i'm sorry you do not have any questions we have one member that wishes to be heard and speaking against the bill chair recognizes representative jasmine clerk thank you mr. speaker colleagues i rise to ask you to vote no on this bill because just like when i spoke on sp89 this bill also includes language that our boards of elections have said we do not need but also we do not need to give the g b i this uh... jurisdiction over the elections we just don't need to do it or investigating elections and so i already gave my speech on sp89 so i will not repeat the entire thing but here's what i will say this bill they added that language because for some reason they really really wanted and something that one of my colleagues said earlier in their speech i think it's it's important and a lot of people were talking and you know and mingling and they weren't really listening but the point that he made was a good point giving the g b i this power and authority gives the governor the power and authority to basically stop the counting of ballots if they feel like they might not be getting the outcome that they want based on exit polls and like he said you might trust the current governor but you trust every single governor after that you don't even know who that's gonna be and so it's really important that we're very careful about the duties that we give to certain entities and it's very important that we're very careful not to intermingle or um... blur the separation of powers in our state because if elections are going to matter and if we want people to actually have faith and confidence in our elections we would not give the the governor the authority to basically tell the g b i to investigate an election that they might be losing so just think about that when you're about to cast your ballot because i do think that's a very important consideration i think my colleague for bringing that up and i don't really have anything else to say about the other sections of this bill i wish that language had not been added but with the addition of that language we are setting a very dangerous president thank you mr. speaker i know the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the Dynamic officer is there any objection reference to withdrawing the committee собой change hat here his none committee substitute is withdrawn graphs suspicion to adopting substitute

All right, we've got a lot to get done and a short time to get there, but we also have some people that are here that we could not do our jobs if it weren't for them. We're going to start with an all-starred group, and that's the office of legislative counsel. Let's give them a big hand. Clerk will read the, I'm sorry, the chair recognizes Chairman England for a motion. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House received from its position on House Bill 9-11 and adopt the committee of conference report. Chairman England has moved that the House adopt the committee of conference report on House Bill 9-11 and adopt the committee of conference report to clerk will read the conference committee report. Committee of conference on House Bill 9-11 recommends that both the House of Representatives and the Senate received from their positions and that the attached committee of conference substitute HB 9-11 be adopted respectfully submitted for the House of Representatives, England of the 116th, Jones the 47th, Burns the 159th for the Senate, Tillery the 19th, Miller the 49th, and Dugan of the 30th. The chair recognizes Chairman England to explain the committee of conference report for House Bill 9-11. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We have one little last bit of business to do before we do a few more last bits of business. I do want to thank our House Budget Research Office staff. Y'all see them every day here at the Council.

and we work with them year round and I want to just tell them again how much we appreciate them and the work that they do. Also I want to again thank my administrative assistant, Ms. Ashley Newton, downstairs that keeps us fed during the many hours that we're involved in the conference committee report, making sure that we stay nourished. And also our friends in the Senate, Chairman Tillery, the Senate budget and evaluation office as well. The governor and OPB built a firm foundation for us to build upon as we worked on this budget that is before you this evening. This $30.2 billion budget represents about a 10.8% increase over last year. Just a real quick overview of what you're going to see in front of you. You want trust funds. As you remember, one of the things that the late Chairman Powell had felt very passionately about was making sure that trust funds were being spent on the things that they were being collected far. So House Bill 511, this is the first budget that you will see before you that actually incorporates all of those pieces as they were meant to be. Number two, education. As we have talked about already, the governor's mentioned and others have mentioned this is the largest investment the state of Georgia has ever made into K-12 education at $11.8 billion. It's the fulfillment of the raise promise that he made early on to $5,000 to our teachers. And so that is all included in this budget as well. And higher education and additional $230 million into the teaching formula to a race and replace those student fees that were initiated a decade ago. You'll also see the incorporation of Senate Bill 397, which reconstitutes the existing Hope GED program to a modern high school equivalency exam grant that pays for taking those equivalency exams and removes yet another obstacle for that completion and that accomplishment. You'll also see the gap funding that Chairman Martin has worked so hard on in House Bill 1435 for the completion grants for those folks just right at the end of their college careers but needing a little help to get over the hump. And then finally something new that was an idea of my Senate colleague, Chairman Tillery, is $2.5 million in the Board of Regents to allow for our rising high school seniors in our foster care system to actually visit college campuses and experience that college sensation that they might not get any other way. Third is our salary increases. You'll see that through just about every line in this budget, but you'll also see in each of those lines as well the first cola for our state retirees in 14 years. But giving a $5,000 cost of living adjustment to our state employees for a cost of roughly $612 million, lifting our entire workforce as they continue to perform flawlessly for us across this state. You saw targeted raises or you see targeted raises for our correctional officers, those that are in our state prisons across the state working to make sure that all of those that are there are safe and that we are on the outside are safe as well. You'll see additions for behavioral health nurses and aids throughout DBHDD. But the two things I want to draw your attention to have been two things in our house priorities and have been house priorities. And that's item number four, which deals with law enforcement and behavioral health. You'll see throughout the document additions and GBI and other law enforcement agencies as an adds to their staffing capabilities, not only for human trafficking, but for gang related work, but also in behavioral health as the governor today sign house bill 1013. You'll see throughout this document those things those corresponding budget entries that are required to fund that much needed upgrade in our system here in the state of Georgia. With the colifer employees and DBHDD and the other investments made in that program area, you'll see in this budget added over $180 million. $180 million to help folks that are having difficulties here in our state and those that will be served and helped by house bill 1013. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been on your desk now for several hours. I've filled in many questions. And on your desk also, you'll find the budget highlights that the house budget research office puts together each year. You'll also find under chair lady, DIMPSY's card, an outline of the house behavioral health and developmental disabilities package as well as under chairman. Hitchens card, you'll also see the house law enforcement package spelled out on your desk and the spreadsheet as well. Mr. Speaker, I have answered many questions at my desk this evening and this afternoon. And I don't know that there's anything left to be asked by based on the questions that have been asked. So at that point, unless you would wish for me to, I will not take any questions. And for one final time, Mr. Speaker, I yield this well. Chairman England has yielded the well for the final time. On the adoption of the conference committee report on house bill 911, all those in favor of the adoption of the conference committee report will vote I. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Thank you. You have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine.

We have a great debt of gratitude to those who protect us while we're working here. We have a big shout out to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Capitol Police.

This recognizes the significant role Native American tribes have played in Georgia. There are three recognized tribes in Georgia. The Lower Muscogee Creek Tribe, the Cherokee of Georgia, and the Georgia Tribe of the Eastern Cherokee. Native American Day here at the capitol will be November 17, 2022. We had a great celebration this year while we were here during redistricting. It was a lovely ceremony as well attended. What this resolution it does is direct and authorize the planning of a peace tree on the capitol grounds. The tree that is known as the peace tree is the Georgia Red Seater, the lovely Evergreen Fragrant Plant. I hope they'll join me in getting this peace tree planted here on the capitol grounds this year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.

Chair recognizes representative Gallup to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is related to e-files of Superior Court clerks of e-filing residential documents. The Senate added back the ability to mail in these filings. So today, this would allow every clerk to receive it electronically through e-file mail or in person. So this just makes every clerk receive an e-file or have the ability to receive an e-file. Happy to answer any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you. On the gentleman's motion at the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 974. All those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.

All the gentlemen's motion at the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1283. All those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 159. The nays are six. This House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1283. The chair recognizes the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee for a motion. Mr. Speaker, I move that we adopt the conference committee report on House Bill 1437. Chairman Blackman has moved that the House adopt the Committee of Conference Report on House Bill 1437. The clerk will read the conference committee report. The committee is on conference on House Bill 1437. I recommend that both the Senate and House of Representatives received from their positions and that the Attach Committee of Conference Substitute to House Bill 1437 be adopted respectfully submitted for the Senate. The Senate, due to the 30th Gouge, is 51st. House statler is 52nd. For the House, Blackman is on the 146th. The Williamson is on the 115th. Martin of the 49th. Chair recognizes chairman Blackman to explain the Committee of Conference Report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hours late. I'll try to move through this quickly, but we came to an agreement with the Senate. Going over a couple of changes as the House passed version, is that this bill again rolls the deductions into a higher standard exemption, personal exemption of 12,000 for single 18,5 to begin with and graduated up to a 24 plus the three for dependence. We move the rate down to a flat 5.49% and graduate that down to 49,9% over time. We are one of currently one of three states that allows the double deduction on state income tax. We remove that from itemizers, but itemizers stay whole. We see savings across the board. In fact, we haven't been able to find anybody that pays any more at all. Everybody either pays zero or less under this plan. It makes us more competitive in a very competitive region with regards to our workforce. It's simple fair and it allows hard work in Georgians to keep more of their hard earned money. Once again, this bill allows $1 billion back in the pockets of hard work in Georgians. I certainly want to thank so many people, the Senate, especially Bruce and Chuck, Representative Williamson and Representative Martin for their hard work. Mr. Speaker, I truly want to thank you for your leadership with regards to cutting taxes for hard work in Georgians. I even want to thank, as lousy as he was to me the other day, my roommate, Chairman Hogan, for doing virtually nothing at all. With that, Mr. Speaker, I think I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, only adoption of the Conference Committee Report on House Bill 1437, all those in favor of the adoption of the Conference Committee Report will vote I. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does the minority caucus will representative Wilkerson Ross? Is it not true that many of my caucus colleagues voted no on this bill, but once the bill was improved that many of us are voting yes to give Georgians back hard earned money. Keep hope alive, keep hope alive, baby. Representative Al Williams said that's because he talked to him. What purpose does representative Bentley rise? The state of the parliament inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that if the chairman of the ways the means committee was still in the well, I would have asked him how would this bill impact the funeral home industry? Well, if you'd have read it, you would have noticed he put in an exemption in there for funeral expenses. Never mind. What purpose does representative Williamson rise? The hate can Mr. Speaker hesitate to ask the parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Even though it was kind of mean to Chairman Hogan, is it not true that chairman Blackman worked tirelessly without sleep over the last 48 hours trying to bring this much improved measure to the citizens of Georgia's death? I would strongly concur with that. And because of him, the taxpayers of Georgia will be paying less money on their taxes. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion to adopt the conference committee report. The eyes are 167. The nays are two.

With that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for your support for this issue. I want to thank Chairman Matt Dubnick and Representative Irwin with their insight and their hard work on this.

The bill is the bill that we voted 99% the other day on those that donate organs to other individuals so that they can continue living. The bill is known as giving the gift of life act. The only change that we have done to this bill is that we have taken the $10,000 tax deduction for those individuals and we've moved it to $25,000. So that they can have this tax deduction for expenses that it took the time off from work. Anything that's involved with donating this organ to this other individual so that they can continue living. That's the only change. The tax deduction from $10,000 to $25,000. And the House amended it that way. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for questions. Is there any, you have no questions.

Representative Wade has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1084 as amended by the House. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 1084, my resident, have weighed to the ninth challenge to the 47th, dupe, and the 29th and others to be entitled to a men title 20, the fiscal to Georgia and the anti-regulating education sales, about the use of and reliance upon curricular training programs which act upon promote or encourage certain concepts.

Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative Wilson rise? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that we should be clear about what we're voting on in this bill? That the bill sponsor did not fail to mention that this bill now adds the transgender sports ban at starting at line 70 and that passing this bill would be inconsistent with the theme of what we have adopted in the House this year. That is promoting mental health for Georgians that this bill targets the most vulnerable Georgians transgender youth that it sets us up not just to be on the wrong side of history and morality but also on the wrong end of litigation. Well, certainly I respect the gentleman's view on that. I think that is something that's open to different viewpoints. What purpose does representative Mitchell rise? It's not working. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that members of this body value the skills and camaraderie that come from sports and value their children participating? And is it not further true that the members of this body who are parents understand that one of the primary things they want for their own children is to be able to be fulfilled in their in their K through 12 education and come out the other end alive. And is it not further true that parents of trans children carry an extra burden because they know the risks for their own children for this simple ask our higher than for the rest of our community. And therefore doing something like this which takes extra feeling of belonging away from children who are at higher risk is something that would at a minimum deserve a floor debate so that the children of Georgia who will be removed from being able to play sports with their peers understand that some of us are out here fighting for them and valuing them. And that we want them alive and included more than anything. Is that not true? I respect the ladies position on that. What purpose does representative cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that it is a shame that this bill only targets transition from male to female and is inconsistent with the GOP's obsession with children who are going through the process of the process. Are going through medical transitions and deserve access to sports? Is it not true that I am ashamed of this house? Okay, we are going to do one more and that is what purpose does representative Stacy Evans rise? Is it not true that if I heard it once, if I heard it twice, if I heard it five times, if I heard it ten times, that parents know what is best for their kids in this house and that they should be able to make the choice of how they want their children to participate in school and what they want them to do in school and that this bill, this amendment flies directly in the face of that statement that we have heard time and time again. Isn't that true? I appreciate the passion around the issue, but this is not a rally as I've said earlier. Okay, have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the gentleman's motion, the eyes are 98, the knees are 71. This house has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1084 as amended by the House. Representative Cannon, do you want to rise? I want to make a motion. What's your motion? To reconsider this bill. For every member to know it's not too late to take a walk. The lady is moved for reconsideration of the bill. All those in favor of the motion will vote aye. Those opposed to reconsideration will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. I have all members voted. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the ladies' motion for reconsideration, the eyes are 70. The knees are 99. The motion has failed.
