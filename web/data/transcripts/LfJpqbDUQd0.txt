I recognize the senator from the 18th
speak to the motion
thank you Mr President uh
bring for you
Senate Bill 246 and some changes were
made in the house side let me explain
and I'll leave that to the center from
the third to discuss but the amendment
that we are providing really puts this
bill back in the form that it was when
we sent it over this bill deals with
ipse grants which are grants to students
in nursing schools in the state of
Georgia the way that the bill came back
to us from the house is that the grant
money was only going to be eligible to
students who were at the University
system of Georgia in nursing school but
not the other nursing schools in Georgia
such as Mercer Emory Bernal and the
other non-profit schools and so that's
simply what amendment number one does
that you'll see and I want to thank my
friends both the Democrats and
Republicans that have signed on to this
thank the minority leader
you'll see that at lines 34 and 35 make
this distinction so that non-profit
private nursing schools those students
that go there are eligible for the grant
as well as University system of Georgia
and you'll see in the second portion of
the amendment this also clarifies that
in the other place in the bill where

that completes the order Mr President
recognize the senator from the 42nd
speak to the amendment
State you're inquiring
um Mr President isn't Senate Bill 222
engrossed
is it not true that Senate Bill 222
isn't grossed let me let me check on
that Senator I don't know
thank you
senator
okay
so the senator from the 23rd
is correct on Senate Bill 222 being
engrossed and so the amendment that the
senator from the 42nd uh offered is out
of order and so Senator you can speak to
you Bill
thank you Mr President uh colleagues
this is Senate bill 222. it's the
measure that we've debated in the past
here it requires that all funding of
primaries and elections in Georgia be
provided through lawfully appropriated
funds it would limit and prohibit the
use of any external funds for elections
in Georgia that is section two the house
did provide a substitute through the
rules committee that is in section three
that section creates a independent it
creates an independence for the state
election board so the state election
board is an independent budget unit that
is associated or affiliated with the
Secretary of State for administrative
purposes but is not under the control of
the Secretary of State it provides for
uh
the ability for the state election board
to be an independent body and administer
its own affairs with that Mr President
I'll yield for questions
you do have a couple questions Senator
Senator from the 26.
but soon as the year but absolutely my
good friend from I think it needs to be
directed to to the to the governor
if
if it was engrossed in the Senate
then they went to the house and they
amended it and it's back over here why
you can't amend it
that's a parliamentary inquiry I believe
uh well I'm asking the Parliamentary I'm
just trying to get it straight it if it
was engrossed in the Senate
but amended in the house and now you
asking us to agree to the highest
substitute to the Senate to to to why
you cannot amend
the highest substitute to Senate bill
222.
Senator I understand the question I
defer to the president of the Senate
the answer is obviously when it's
engrossed in the Senate not it's it's
engrossed even when it comes back from
the house but we can't we can't engross
a bill over in the house
as I'm sure you know having served in
the house for so long
but once it got it when it when it
starts here and we engross it and if it
comes back it's still considered engross
as far as the Senate is concerned
thank you Mr President if there are no
other questions I'll yield well I
recognize the senator from the 42nd
thank you Mr President when
um we passed SB 202 and HB um I think it
was HB
316 yes HB 316 when we purchased the new
voting machines and SB 202 when we did a
thorough rewrite of our elections laws
both bills created a series of unfunded
mandates
on local governments in running
elections
local governments including mine who are
under a lot of pressure
are completely understaffed
seeking workers in a tight labor market
these election workers often face
threats
and there's a labor market
in addition local governments including
the one I represent in DeKalb County
our elections board as I'm assuming is
the case for most of your elections
boards have to go to the governing
Authority
our County Commission to get funding for
their elections board
faced with all of these additional
requirements
put upon the the local elections boards
by the state of Georgia
all unfunded mandates local governments
did what I would think Republicans
conservatives would think would be a
smart thing
they went out and in the pandemic year
when the election was going to be
incredibly difficult to conduct
non-profits took a look foundations took
a look and said we're going to have this
grant system that people can take
counties can apply to take advantage of
and red counties did that and blue
counties did that
the shame of this bill
is you are raising taxes
on all the locals because this body has
put all these requirements on the locals
they are all unfunded
and now you're saying we will not let
you be enterprising be Innovative be
creative and try to that all red
counties could apply for too fill some
budgetary gaps
when the general assembly considers the
fiscal impacts of the laws it
deliberates we should be considering the
financial impact
of both revenues and expenses
and sb222 seeks to reduce revenues from
supplemental funding to local
governments causing the local
governments to have to make a net
increase in expenditures
the waiving of the fiscal note
requirement the statutory fiscal note
requirement for HB 316 and for um and
certainly for SB 202 is currently being
litigated because
when the fiscal the the statutory
requirement to have a fiscal a fiscal
analysis of the increased burden on
local elections boards was put before
this body it was raised in the statutory
provision that it was it was
um out of order to consider the bill
without having an understanding of how
much it was going to cost local
governments and then meanwhile we had on
our desks reams of paper as to how much
more it was going to cost local
governments
that was um dismissed by the president
at that time and and overruled and
therefore it is now subject to a lawsuit
which wastes more taxpayer money that
could be used to Simply provide the
ability for our local elections boards
in these heavily populated densely
populated counties to be able to run
elections with efficiency so that we
don't have to wait in line for four
hours let me just tell you that when I
won its early vote in DeKalb County this
last election we they have again
enterprising we have an app where you
can look and try to the website to try
to see where you can go of the early
voting locations where the line is the
shortest
good very smart so I landed at
Hartsfield and I was like I'm a the last
day of early voting I'm gonna go do it
and so I looked on the app to see where
the line was the shortest and by the
time I got there
the line was already two hours long
maybe some of you don't understand about
that
because you live in rural counties where
you never would would maybe wait for two
hours I don't know I'm not trying to
dictate what happens in your county
but I would appreciate the same respect
for those of us who have to vote in
these large Urban counties and and and
and if you say you don't really think
unnecessary tax increases are a good
idea I would appreciate you not foisting
unnecessary tax increases on us
or at least own it say yes we do want to
cab and Fulton and Cobb and Gwinnett to
have to raise taxes to run their
elections and we and we and we certainly
don't think that's going to be necessary
in our counties it just smells bad
because it really looks at what you're
trying to do is make elections much more
difficult to conduct in large Urban dare
I say Democratic counties and it's
patently obvious
and it's offensive
and if you want to do that I say provide
the funding that we are required to
provide under the statute or own the
fact that you intend to make it harder
in urban counties and raise taxes in
urban counties just so we can go vote
and one of the amendments
was a bill that was heard in the house
an excellent uh bill by a new
representative who's an attorney and who
has worked extensively on voter
protection matters
and that Bill said that
um women who are pregnant
or parents with small children in tow or
a child with special needs would not
have to wait in the DeKalb County
three-hour line because there's
inadequate Staffing and funding so that
was going to be a great amendment to
show that what you really do care about
is letting people vote fairly
efficiently and safely and not forcing
people to wait in line for four hours
but what it seems like is you really
want to wait people force people to wait
in line for four hours in the hopes that
they'll just leave
and not come back in Democratic counties
so
if there was any notion in this building
about fairness and safety we would see
it reflected in some of the bills we
filed we we filed the bill so that
pregnant women don't have to wait for
four hours we filed the bill so that uh
another amendment I was going to present
so that individuals who who sought to be
on the absentee ballot rollover list
would be able to do so we filed the bill
that there can be poll workers across
county lines we filed the bill so that
on Election Day the early vote centers
are still open because guess what
everyone gets confused
when they try to go vote at the early
vote Center just to be told oh sorry you
actually can't vote here today on
Election Day You've Got to Now sit in in
Atlanta traffic and drive over to your
Precinct none of that has anything to do
with Safety and Security it has to do
with making people wait in line and
making it as difficult as possible to
vote in urban counties and if there was
a good faith effort to engage on this
stuff I would not be standing up here
letting you know exactly how I feel
about this but there just isn't and it
is offensive that the minute my County
decided you know what we're not going to
raise taxes on everyone in our County
we've got this non-profit with a great
offer where we have been straining under
the unfunded mandates and the lack of
resources to conduct our elections for
the citizens of DeKalb County and this
Foundation wants to help and now you
take that away
it really just strains credulity
so this bill is terrible and when y'all
are ready to engage on actually being
straight about running elections then we
can have a conversation about that but
until then I think I've pretty
accurately called out exactly what's
going on in this chamber as it relates
to voting thank you Mr President I yield
the well
Senators yielded well
I recognize senator from 37th speak to
the motion
listen I'm going to try to bring this
back down to earth and then we can we
can get on this motion I
heard the passion plea by the center
from the 42nd I appreciate her concern
for fiscal accountability and and
keeping taxes low and all those kinds of
things but uh this issue is one of basic
fairness I was talking to a group of
school kids not long ago and I raised
this issue with him it was it was it was
the question
um that was raised by the senator from
the 42nd I said um I want you to imagine
for me this was this was a group of kids
from a from an urban setting
um I want you to imagine for me these
wealthy outer lying Suburban counties
that have the dollars to keep their
polls open longer to have more density
of drop boxes and polls and oh by the
way there were wealthy billionaires from
around the country that sent dollars
into these counties to help support in
so many ways to have more access to the
poles shorter lines all these kind of
things
and poor or struggling counties
perhaps struggling Urban counties didn't
have the dollars to do that is that fair
to have this inequity if private dollars
pouring into some counties
to make it easy to vote
and and being stuck on only public
dollars in other counties and the kid
said no that's not fair at all so it was
not not fair so these those counties
over here these conservative counties
with dollar private money pouring in
should never be allowed to do that it
should be fair for everybody
I said that's exactly right and that's
exactly what we're doing it's just the
circumstance is fair for everybody
what the lady raised was the the
millions of dollars pouring into certain
constituencies engineered by
out-of-state actors who are trying to
bring about an electoral outcome in
Georgia
shocks the conscience of people across
the political Spectrum
all Senate Bill 222 does
but what it does very well is make sure
that any outside Foundation dollars that
come to this state are spread evenly
across the state
so there's equal access to all people
and that outside entities can't
privately fund election outcomes in one
place versus another to accomplish their
engineered outcome to try to engineer
outcome
for certain communities Senate Bill 222
does it fairly Senate 222 is not filled
with the some of the hypocrisy we've
heard referred to here in fact I think
the shoe may be on the other foot this
is a fair measure and those that oppose
it are simply trying to engineer an
outcome by private entities trying to
tip the scale
from from one side to the other on that
Mr President urge members to support
Senate bill 222.
um
Senator has yielded the whale
recognize senator from the 53rd
Senator if you senator from 36 if you'd
like to come speak in the well you're
welcome to after the centers from 53rd
thank you Mr President
I just couldn't believe some of the
stuff I've heard from the well on this
piece of legislation frustrated that
we're going to raise taxes or somebody
might have to raise taxes for a free and
fair election
are you suggesting that perhaps private
dollars would be better used in an
election as it's been done in the past I
think this is a wonderful piece of
legislation and I can't wait to vote
green on something today thank you Mr
President
I recognize the senator from the seventh
thank you Mr President I rise in
opposition to Senate Bill 222 there's a
saying that don't cut your nose despite
your face there were red counties in
2020 that also participated in outside
funding for their election boards
including Cherokee Paulding Columbia and
Lowndes County any County can apply for
outside funding this is like we why are
we removing a tool to help our election
board officials run better elections I I
don't understand like why we're doing
this why is this body again I mentioned
this before why is his body making it
harder to administer elections I oppose
this legislation I encourage everyone to
vote no thank you Mr President I yield
the well
does any other Senator wish to speak
forward against the measure senator from
the 23rd would you like closed debate
thank you Mr President you know
colleagues we've been here before we've
had the same discussions the same
debates the same complaints the same
rhetoric and the same false information
okay let's make sure we understand
you can get all the third party funding
you choose to through the state election
board
so anyone who chooses to can make a
donation to the state of Georgia and the
state of Georgia can equitably disperse
those funds it's pretty simple second of
all let's talk about how long it takes
to vote
well my good friend from the 37th excuse
me from the 42nd my good friend from the
42nd showed up on a Friday afternoon
the last day of early voting well no
wonder the lines are long how long was
the lines on voting day anybody want a
hazard a guess
10 minutes 10 minutes you have three
weeks to vote three weeks to vote and we
just passed a bill Senate Bill 129 that
even expands that by letting you take
time off during early voting we're
expanding early voting
you know uh
I get a little concerned sometimes when
large Metro counties are compared to
small rural counties
now I want to ask a question
are the votes in DeKalb County more
important than the votes in Toliver
County
to Oliver county is one of the smallest
counties in Georgia it's primarily a
democratic County but I protect their
right to vote there's no difference in
whether you live in a Metro region or
rural region the vote counts the same
uh I appreciate the comments from my
friend from the 37th
and I really appreciate my comments from
my friend from the 53rd because
if the senator from the 53rd could
support this measure the rest of us can
join him thank you Mr President I yield

from the 31st
the right Amendment
thank you Mr President
um we've got a couple of things here I'm
going to be very brief and kind of go
through
House Bill 340 the underlying bill is a
bill that will help securing teacher
planning time and improve school safety
awareness it protects planning periods
much like the duty-free Lunch Period
does not change the length of time for
planning periods and continues to give
the school the authority to use the
length of each School planning period it
encourages teachers to engage in
students and renew the school security
plan and also this bill will protect the
planning time for all Educators across
the state which will also help them
with implementing the new literary
curriculums recently passed briefly I'll
just say I support the amendment from
the senator from the 27th which is
cleanup language per the request of the
governor in amendment 2 which is my
Amendment I'll speak to it which is
basically language that
is protecting teachers this is probably
the most pro-teacher Amendment you will
vote for just to ensure that we don't
have Bad actors messing with teachers in
our schools with their contracts and
performance and I want to be very clear
before I leave this well to the citizens
in Paulding County Georgia
[Music]
um
you know there's been much to say about
the amendment and the origination of
this Senate bill and my wife's a teacher
and I want every teacher in Paulding
County Georgia to know that I support
our teachers I will always have our back
their backs no matter what goes on
before elected officials and for any
elected official to try and you know
bully me from the Paulding County School
Board or to use members of the house to
do it I will not stand by it I will not
be threatened and I will not be pushed
around so just to be very clear so that
our teachers know that we will always
support them and you know I take it
personally because you're going to mess
with the teacher you're messing with my
wife Mr President I yield the well
Senator has yielded the well senator
from the 42nd would you
send it from the 42nd would you like to
be recognized
he's centered as yielded
recognize the senator from the 27th to
speak for his to his Amendment
I know at the center from the 42nd had a
question about the amendment or not so I
mainly came up here to see if she did
this fixes something we in Senate Bill
204 that we passed week before last the
governor's office contacted me over the
weekend and we're changing arbitration
changing mediation to arbitration to
allow the appeals process that we
described in the bill they will fix that
in the order of signing the bills so
that was the purpose for my Amendment Mr
President answer any questions on that
if that's what the question was about if
not I yield the well
good
question you have no question senator
you got your Amendment here senator

recognize the
senator from the senator from 31st

foreign
thank you Mr President I was going to
ask the fine gentleman from the 31st a
couple questions but I didn't have the
opportunity so I thought I would just
come up here really quickly
um I recall this bill I believe which is
the subject of I believe Amendment two
I remember it in education and youth
committee
I I believe it was SB 98 I believe it
did not
actually
come on to the rules consideration
calendar and if it ever did it didn't it
did not um come out of this body so it
is not a bill that has been passed by
this body and it is therefore not been
debated and the reason I'm raising that
is I have right here a letter that I
just you know had a couple questions
about from the superintendent in Paul of
the Paulding County School System that
you know raises a number of allegations
surrounding this particular situation
that apparently is the underlying
situation related to SB 98 I have no
opinion on that it has obviously not
been discussed by this body and it is
clearly something Central to the sender
from the 31st District just wanted to
point out that this bill did not
actually advance and this chamber has
not been debated and we have letters
here from uh the superintendent and
locals related to this particular
incident
um that was SB 98 now Amendment two so I
just have a lot of questions about about
whether it's wise for the body to move
forward and certainly respect the
senator from the 31st opinion on that
thank you um yield for any questions and
if not I you'll do well you have no
questions

president
senator from what purpose do you rise
we're from the sixth
Mr President without objection the
senator from the six says excuse
senator from 50 seconds you made it down
to the well all right
Well's yours thank you Mr President
November 4th of 2020 we passed a
constitutional amendment
that I had been the Senate sponsor of
that dedicated the fees to where they
were intended to
uh for many years there had been fees
used for other purposes uh driver's ed
scrap tires things like that
the great Appropriations chairman from
Statesboro
had concerns he had been here through
the misery years
which I got to miss fortunately and
wanted some limitations on it some
triggers one of the limitations we put
on it was that it could not be more than
one percent
of the state budget
so many many fees were put in there
but the Hazardous Waste fees were not
put in there because there was concern
we might go over the one percent limit
since then we've consistently shown that
we're below that we're at about 0.79
these would only bring it up to about
0.82 or point out eight three well under
the limit so this would
put the intent of the voters on that

others a bill to be entitled an act to

Georgia annotated relating to crimes and
offenses so as to provide for mandatory

Court's deviation from mandatory minimum
sentencing regarding certain offenses to
amend title 16 of the official code of
Georgia annotate that completes the
order Miss president
William Jackson I recognize the center
from the 50th
thank you Mr President
I rise today and bring you Senate bill
44. this is a bill that we have uh
passed through this body already it
received a lot of debate this is a bill
that I'm bringing on behalf of Governor
Kemp I want to thank the governor for
his efforts in uh
fighting gangs throughout the state of
Georgia giving prosecutors the tools
they need to be more effective I want to
thank the lieutenant governor for his
support of this bill and the Attorney
General as well
uh there there's no room for street
gangs in Georgia
this bill is going to help prosecutors
across the state
it's going to help children and it's
it's gonna
really provide serious penalties for
someone that tries to recruit a child
into a life of crime by asking them to
join a street gang
along with the effort to crack down on
crime
the governor also seeks to add very two
straightforward practical changes to
Georgia's unsecured judicial release
statute by codifying what should be
regular practice amongst our judges
today
um
first it provides that a judge may not
issue an unsecured judicial release on
the basis of his or her own recognizance
basically a signature Bond if the
accused person has been previously
convicted of bell jumping or has
otherwise failed to appear in court for
in the last five years so that's a
change that was made over in the house
second this bill makes clear that prior
to issuing an unsecured judicial release
a judge must consider the accused
criminal history so before a judge
allows somebody to get off and get out
of jail on their own recognizance he has
to he has to at least look at their
previous criminal history
Mr President this is a like I said
before this bill has already received
extensive debate in this chamber and for
those reasons I will respectfully ask
for your favorable consideration and I
will yield the will thank you Mr
President
Senators yielded the well I recognize
the senator from the 14th
thank you Mr President the governor's
bill is a bad Bill and the reason it's
bad let's put aside the discussion we
had on SB 44 when it was first in this
chamber first in this chamber right
because you know we all remember that
discussion about gang activity and
recruiting minors you know we made an
argument as a minority party that uh sex
trafficking victims should be excluded
from prosecution under this bill which I
think was such an obvious bipartisan
move that multiple members of the
majority came with us on that proposed
amendment uh but here we are we're back
with the original version of this build
but plus more uh more Provisions now
relating to cash bail but these cash
bail Provisions are not limited to gang
activity this is across the board a
change in cash bail now our colleagues
in the house maybe not you know minority
party in the house is not maybe the most
credible source of information to appeal
to in this chamber but they said the the
name Nathan Deal a lot just like I have
said the name Nathan Deal a lot and I've
tried to say it as many times as I can
from this well because again then for
the umpteenth time there's a trajectory
towards Progressive uh or common sense
bipartisan uh bail reform and that Trend
that Governor Nathan Deal took us on we
are no longer on we are now in the
opposite direction uh moving to
Crackdown on pre-trial release I went
actually personally to a pre-trial
Justice Conference a few months ago
where stakeholders from throughout the
state uh prosecutors defense attorneys
non-profit employees folks who think
about this problem came together to talk
about what we can do on cash bail and
one of the things or pre-trial release
in general one of the things that they
they you know remarked is that we've got
rules on cash bail that don't match up
with the data and one of the reasons we
don't have the data we make a lot of
decisions on pre-trial release in here
that are not Based on data in jails and
across the state practices to determine
what actually promotes Public Safety the
most so you now are in a situation where
if you look at line was 159 through 170
of this bill or 169 actually it's 170.
if somebody
misses court because they simply forgot
and there was a bench warrant issued for
their arrest which by the way is a very
common practice have you ever been to
Municipal Court somebody's not there
during the roll call a lot of Judges
will just say bench warrant bench
warrant bench warrant
if somebody gets one bench warrant once
and that not even necessarily arrested
not even necessarily convicted
then that starts a five-year clock where
they can never be released on their own
recognizance for any charge within the
next five years now it does exclude
non-serious traffic offenses
but there are lots of offenses trespass
you know criminal damage to property
where you know there might be a
misunderstanding again it's just a
charge in this country you're innocent
until you're convicted
but if you happen to miss Court
then you start a five-year clock where
you have to use cash bail for literally
any charge that person could possibly
have I want you to think about that
you have lots of jurisdictions that
don't have text message reminders don't
have clear uh you know reliable mailing
practices to remind people when court is
it may be that when you're pulled over
the citation you get is the only
information you get about when you got
to go to court
and what if you lose that paper right
or maybe you have to go into work on an
emergency and you think I'll lose my job
if I don't go into work today I know
that technically I've got a court date
but hopefully I can figure something out
I've got to go into work or else I lose
my job
so then all of a sudden if that bench
warrant is issued
now mandatory cash bill I mean really
think about that by the way this bill
excludes non-serious traffic offenses
on the bench warrant aspect of it but it
doesn't exclude non-serious traffic
offenses on the flip side of it during
that five-year clock
so let's say you missed court for some
reason and there are plenty of human
reasons to miss Court I mean we it again
it's easy to stand up in this well and
demonize people who Miss court but there
are plenty I guarantee you of basic
human reasons why people Miss court and
again going back to my little you know
flag in the sand if we had
administrative Solutions like sending
text message reminders in every
jurisdiction to get people to come to
court people want to comply 99 of the
time but anyway so let's say you missed
court now all of a sudden you get
charged with the you know improper lane
change or uh or speeding or your tail
lights out now all of a sudden the judge
does not have discretion for five years
to let you go on your own recognizance
they have to put a cash dollar value on
your bail
and what have we discussed in here
before when it comes to one dollar bonds
five dollar bonds sure you'll see them
occasionally
but the whole point
of the bill before you
and bills that have preceded it is to
make it more difficult for judges who
are elected officials to issue Bond
decisions that look lenient
so even if the judge is looking at a
pathetic case in front of them somebody
who you know really is on the line with
their work their employment situation
really struggles to find transportation
to get to court to get to their job that
judge no longer has the discretion to
show Mercy to show compassion
and if that judge is worried about the
Optics they might say 500 Bond a
thousand dollar Bond they don't want to
issue a one dollar Bond or a five dollar
Bond
so again you know this is the type of
thing where we trust judges with
discretion why
because they see the human Elements Face
to Face they know firsthand
what the human being in front of them is
going through way better than anybody
sitting in this room so to take it away
categorically a judge's discretion
to be not lenient but humane
in situations where people are missing
Court once or twice that's not good
policy and it's not what the state of
Georgia should be doing
uh and you know
coming up here when the result is baked
on a Governor's bill doesn't feel great
but I'm not going to miss an opportunity
to try to remind everybody and hear that
these decisions are going to have long
lasting consequences that make it harder
for people to live their everyday lives
and stay in compliance with a Criminal
legal system that in here we are not
calibrating right now to be responsive
to what human beings really need
anyway
33-23 Mr President I'll yield for
questions you do have some questions
Senator recognize senator from the 37th
or question
this is Jim and you I do I'm just trying
to ask some clarifying questions here
because this is um
you know there are a lot of things we
talk about the details that really
matter in this place but I want to make
sure you know these details that you
described seem like they can really
really matter to people so I want to
make sure I'm clear because I don't want
to act in either way on this without
being fully understanding so what you're
saying is describe the circumstance that
you talked about failure to appear you
get your one shot but then on the back
side minor traffic offenses are not
considered walk through a fact pattern
or what you mean so we can understand
what exactly you're talking about okay
imagine thank you actually for that
opportunity imagine this scenario here's
a real case that I dealt with when I was
in law school Clinic up in Connecticut
they do things a lot differently up
there but human beings are pretty
similar so this was a real case that
happened when I was in law school there
was a handful of friends who got invited
over to a friend's house
the property owner didn't like this is
like an apartment complex Property
Owners didn't like that the residents
were inviting too many people over at
one time so they had a standing no
trespass order on that apartment complex
that basically invited police to come
take away anybody the property owner
didn't really want to be there now again
if you live somewhere you have a valid
right to invite guests to your house or
your apartment that's just part of
living and so you know what basically
happened is a few friends come over
they're chilling they're not doing
anything wrong
property owner sees that there's a
gathering gets police on scene
the the in the person who lives in the
apartment explains the police officer
you need to understand these are just my
friends I'm having them over right
police officer says well too bad there's
a standing no trespass order it's not
trespass but they issued the no trespass
order those are charges right trespass
charges that's not a non-serious traffic
offense right so it's a trespass charge
so imagine a scenario like that police
officer hands you a paper citation which
is a second like a copy of the citation
they keep
and you lose that paper citation or you
have work or one of these scenarios that
I'm trying to evoke in terms of why a
person would miss courts so if you
legitimately miscourt you're wrong but
you missed Courtney yeah you know the
charge is a charge maybe you're Innocent
but you miss court on the first charge
and it's one of these jurisdictions
let's say it's a rural Georgia
jurisdiction uh that only has court once
every you know three weeks or whatever
and it's kind of just a calendar call if
y'all ever sat in court you know how
this goes the judge just moves through
cases really fast if somebody's not
there bench warrant they're not here
bench warrant right so underline 166 no
bench warrant has been issued for arrest
doesn't say that they were arrested
doesn't say they're convicted warrants
just issued on a person's failure appear
in court within the last five years
right and the non-tier traffic offense
language doesn't apply because we're
talking about trespass all right
now all of a sudden that person for the
next five years is locked in if they get
pulled over for a broken tail light the
judges forced to issue a cash bail bond
decision so so what you're saying then
is if that condition if you miss Court
you're wrong
you're saying for five years after that
if you're pulled over for a traffic
citation any traffic citation you're
getting arrested getting booked and
going to jail for that and and then you
have to make paper unless you post bonds
sir and there and the reason is because
unsecured judicial release is the only
remaining way in this state that you can
get released without cash bail on your
own recognizance so in that scenario
let's say the judge is in a circuit
where they have to appear tough on crime
which is many judges
and they don't want to issue a one
dollar Bond I mean we hear a lot in this
building well maybe they can just issue
a one dollar Bond but as I've said from
this well before the then chairman no
longer chairman of anything in the house
Judiciary Committee uh said that's the
point the point is that we force them to
purport a dollar value so that judges
will increase the number that they're
not really going to issue a one dollar
bond in many cases so let's say that for
that traffic stop you get a one thousand
dollar Bond now you're in the territory
of what we like to talk about minority
party which is criminalizing poverty and
putting somebody in circumstance where
we just wreck their life a little bit we
make it a lot harder for them to comply
and do things we want them to do they
miss their job you know they lose or
miss work they lose their job they miss
a family obligation they're not a
compliance with family or child support
obligations all that I mean you you
compound all those problems when you put
somebody in that trap so Jim and further
yield I do so you know we may disagree
on some provisions of cash buying I
certainly believe most folks have to
pass have to post bond for what most
folks will think about crimes we may
disagree on that
but I do want to make sure we have
Clarity so because I think I think the
bipartisan whole of this body would
wants to understand the effect of what
we're doing so if someone has a failure
to appear in court they're wrong for it
admittedly you're saying I want to make
sure we're clear
that if you're pulled over for a traffic
offense
you're going to the house you can't just
be you can't deal without a roadside and
move on with your business anything
because every traffic offense in this
state is a misdemeanor so if you have a
busted tail light you're trying to get
fixed the next day and the officer
decides that they're going to issue a
citation cash fail no unsecured judicial
release we may disagree three on cash
bail and other offenses and I know we I
know that we do I just want to make sure
there's not unintended consequences
about folks that think they're going to
get released on the side of the road for
a speeding ticket they're going to get
put in a cop car and taking away and
they're they're after their evening
changes dramatically and that's a really
good point and I wasn't doing a good
enough job of putting a finer point on
this I'm thankful to the center for the
37th when a police officer issues U.S
citation and lets you go that is a form
of being on your own recognizance and
the risk here is that if cash bail is
mandatory just for a charge again you're
not convicted yet you still could be
innocent legally you still are innocent
legally police officer may be forced
under a bill like this to put you in the
car take you to jail until you can post
whatever the bond is that the judge sets
one final question so does uh does the
gentleman contemplated an amendment
hypothetically that would say if if the
subsequent offense in the five years was
a standard traffic offense you could
still be released on your own
recognizance there but otherwise could
not be released because I do think there
are members in this body that draw a
huge distinction
from driving 12 miles an hour of the
speed limit or 16 miles an hour speed
limit from shoplifting I have no issue
with someone getting booked and going to
jail for shopping although you may
disagree but I do see speeding as
something different I want to make sure
there's a there's a way forward Senator
sadly and tragically I agree with you on
this but the procedural posture of the
bill makes us unable to make an
amendment at this point we could have
maybe you know moved to agree as amended
and changed this but I'm not gonna I
play some games because we're all
politicians I wasn't going to play a
game today and do an agree as amended
just to make that point take it out
because ultimately I'm not going to vote
for the underlying bill so it was it
would be in bad faith for me to make
that motion knowing that I was going to
vote no but here we are on the debate on
the actual motion before us not subject
to Amendment and and candidly we might
be stuck you know you vote for the
Governor's bill today I think you create
those sorts of unintended consequences
and what I really wish is that the
governor's office had had drawn the line
at the the gang provisions of this and
not tried to put in this cash Bill stuff
at the last minute senator
senator from the second
Senator do you yield I do
Senator does this bill reference the
number of typographical errors that
happen when citations are entered into a
system and a summons and a notice to
appear may be sent out and the address
could be incorrect and so the intended
party didn't even get the notice and so
is it not further true that while you're
driving you get pulled over and they say
you have a failure to appear for a
traffic offense for a summons that you
never received because somebody had a
typographical error in putting your
address on the summons is that not true
Center makes an excellent point you know
the Beatles said I you get by with a
Little Help from your friends and I'm
thankful to the centers for raising
points I didn't address in my main
speech if you this provision here just
says a bench warrant has to be issued
based on failure to appear it does not
have an exception for an unlawfully or
mistakenly issued bench warrant so to
the Senator's exact point if there is a
defense effect in the notice that you
receive to go to court for whatever
reason typographical error mistake of
address that sort of thing then if the
warrant is issued in your name for the
failure to appear you are stuck under
this bill it does not matter that it was
unfairly issued that five-year clock
starts to run
uh further questions Senator yes what is
the remedy in the judicial system for
someone who has received bad notice or a
bad summons to appear before court
because of a typographical era how would
one correct such a remedy in our
Judicial System how would one fix that
under this bill there isn't a remedy
Center
for the question okay so if a individual
were to be held in another County
because I drive up I-16 and let's say I
get stopped in one of the counties on
I-16
and I had a ticket and I forgot about it
and they mailed it to the wrong address
would I beheld and the Twigs County Jail
potentially for a missed notice in
another County because I got pulled over
there and they saw that I was missing I
had a bench warrant Senator tyr point
and it's what I've already said if the
warrant is issued in your name for a
failure to appear it does not matter if
there are any circumstances that lead to
that by mistake this bill is then
triggered and there is a five-year
period in which you are unable to get on
recognizance release and final question
Senator is there any way for the average
citizen to go and check to see if they
have a warrant anywhere I mean how do
you find out I mean I'm sure many
members of this body don't even know
that if they may or may not have a
warrant somewhere how do we know I'm a
member of this body and an attorney and
I cannot tell you off the top of my my
head if there is some comprehensive way
in every jurisdiction to find out if
you've got a bench warrant for your
arrest when exactly your court date is I
think it varies by jurisdiction but the
point here is y'all this is look we come
up here and we argue against your bills
and we say hey this is a bad one vote
against it this is a mistake I mean this
should not be in this bill and your leg
to stand on in terms of passing a
Governor's Bill the gang stuff would be
so much stronger if the house had not
added this Bond language it's a really
tough position to be in I get it but I'm
asking my colleagues sincerely please do
not let this happen today
uh uh got one more question Senator
future take it recognize senator from
the 53rd
thank you Mr President will the senator
yield I do you said 33-23 do you think
that might be changed to 31.25 I'm I'm
simply a humble man uh Senator and I
would not uh take for granted any of my
colleagues votes I was just making the
rhetorical point that when it's a
Governor's Bill typically you get a
partisan split but I think that there is
some interest in the body today just
looking at people's faces that this
issue is a tough one senator
thank you Mr President
Senators yield to the well
does any other Center wish to speak for
against the measure
center from the 50 50th you can close
the bay
thank you Mr President uh once again I'm
going to ask you to vote uh in favor of
this bill to address the concerns of the
senator from the 14th this was not a
last minute bill
this bill has been vetted this bill has
been worked and
if you do not show up for court and you
have a bench warrant
let's say you had work and then you go
back to court you tell them hey I didn't
show up then the the warrant will be
recalled
and once the warrants were called The
Five-Year clock no longer applies that's
what it says in the bill
it says that this sub paragraph shall
not apply if such warrant was recalled
second
for mistaken identity bench warrants
if a person
objects to their criminal history
then the burden then shifts to the
prosecutor to prove that the criminal
history is accurate so the two concerns
brought up by the senator from the 14th
um while I respect you they have been
addressed we have thought about those
two concerns and I asked your favorable
consideration of this Bill thank you
very much the Senators yielded the whale
does Indiana Senate which speak for
against measure
hearing none
the senator has moved
to agree to the Senate bill
and those in favor of his motion will
vote yay those opposed nay secretary and
lightning machine oh
how many Senator Mr President at
Department of inquiry station inquiry
we've got 53 seconds to ask it
I'm not clear what we're voting on I'm
not clear the effect of this bill and I
I was just trying to ask the gentleman
to say it's been addressed
if someone's got a bench warrant I don't
mind them going to jail but if someone
does not have a bench warrant but
they've simply been had failure to
appear in five years and they go to jail
for getting to speak they have an issue
with that Mr President and I don't know
if parliamentary
how do we address that Senator I
understand it but at the end of the day
where the votes already started so it's
down to a red or green decision
on the paths of the measure the yeas are
30 and the days are 20.
and this having directs the
Constitutional majority is therefore
passed
I recognize the procreations chair for
the 19th promotion thank you Mr
President I move the center degree to
the committee conference committee
report to house bill 19.
secretary read the caption
Committee of conference on House Bill 19
recommends that both the House of
Representatives and the Senate received
from their Physicians and that the
attached Committee of conference
substitute to House Bill 19 be adopted
respectfully submitted by The Honorable
Lake tillary Center 19th District
Senator Kennedy of the 18th District
Senator Gooch of the 51st District
conference committee substitute to House
Bill 19 a bill to be entitled an act to
make and provide Appropriations for the
state fiscal year beginning July 1st
2023 and ending June 30th 2024. that
completes the order Mr President
recognize the senator from the 19th
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President I'll be brief
thank you appreciate that
I was going to ask whose grave he got
those off of but I think some people in
the out in the Halls may already be
predicting that
might be mine
uh Mr President I bring to this body the
conference committee report
to House Bill 19 the states fy24 General
Appropriations budgets 34 32.4 billion
it funds every agency
from this body the legislature to
Veterans at the end and the services
that we provide for our veterans
the big highlights you already are aware
of we were able to maintain the Senate's
position on quite a few things
the 500 now comp waivers are reflected
in this budget
money oh yeah listen that's fine with me
go for it
money concerning dyslexia is in this
budget I do want to point out it has a
trim remember that that
the effective date for that is fy25
so there was a trim of about a million
to try to balance out funds
hope is that 100 percent
The Hope numbers the way we were able to
fund hope public and private at 100
percent was by using updated numbers for
of students our USG population has been
declining as you know
so that helped us save a little with a
little bit of savings there and by
updating those numbers we think we can
make both of those fit in the program in
Lottery funds
shout out also to our commissioner at
Lottery who has done a tremendous job
over the past three years of of
outperforming revenues and we know
they'll do that again
hoteling
a major focus of this body money's in
this budget address hoteling substantial
funding at DHS to begin to continue
preparing for pandemic unwinding
the tasks that we have placed on DHS
though that's been placed on all states
to unwind uh after that after the
pandemic though is daunting I am so
appreciative of that staff of
commissioner Bros
even with these increased funds
just the man hours to do it are going to
be so difficult and we're we want to
make sure she has all the support from
this agent from our body that she can
but the task is not going to be easy
even with funding sometimes there's
things dollars just can't do
we also took in and put into this budget
a policy concerning our child caring
institutions
because of changes at the federal level
what's called Federal 4E funding is not
available to many of our group homes
that help foster children in the past we
need them to make a conversion so
they'll still be eligible for those
federal funds we provided roughly 18
million dollars for them to get our 15
million dollars now I think had to
Coleman in the conference committee to
get ready for that and we hope we can
incentivize and move those bodies
quickly so that we can continue their
Federal funding
officer pay most state officers receive
a six thousand dollar pay raise many
others receive a four thousand dollar
Pace a race at Regents and University
system of Georgia there was a cut as you
know in this when it left this body of
80 roughly 80 million to the teaching
formula and 18-ish million or so too
um
Insurance the insurance money was
restored the reduction at teaching is
now 66 million with the direction that
they focus on their carry forward funds
to help cover that cost
also point out remember that to that
enrollment's been declining
when they can there's probably other
ways that businesses would use to to
handle that as well
someone asked for a reporter carry
forward funds is 504 million in October
of 22 when we got the last report we get
a report roughly every October
at dbhdd 117 million dollars towards
initiatives concerning mental health and
in developmental disabilities the Senate
the conference commence Conference
committee's Final version has 47
additional million dollars on top of the
additions that were made for the
governor this body has focused on
funding
concerning mental health and I believe
that 117 million dollar addition for
this year shows our commitment
buildings
get ready for the list
we have funded buildings at Valdosta I
mean at Fort Valley State University
Northeast North Georgia College sorry
University of North Georgia ffne
Georgia State University Kennesaw State
University Columbus State University
Dalton state O'Kelly Library the
Cedartown Library the Georgia Military
College Denmark Library the University
of North Georgia main campus the Banks
County Library Georgia Southern
University land at Piedmont Technical
College East Georgia College Georgia
Southwestern and the University of
Georgia
it's a lot of buildings
design at Albany Tech at Augusta Tech at
Atlanta Tech at Georgia College and
State University the University of West
Georgia Albany State the college of
Coastal Georgia and then a review of
Quick Start facility for rivian most
likely Morgan County Georgia
I told you this earlier that we may have
to have a longer discussion about
buildings moving forward the planning
dollars I cannot promise you that we're
going to be able to fund the buildings
for next year with the planning dollars
we have now
it's going to be a longer discussion we
expect to have with the governor's
office and with the house as we move
forward after this budget hopefully
passes
but that's one two three four five
twenty four buildings
or planning and design for such building
and the bonds that would cover that in
the next year would be substantial
other highlights are going to reflect
the highlights you saw for the FY 24
budget
um
previously that I brought to you
I think these are the high points that
you many of you are already aware of and
many of you have come to me and asked me
questions at my desk before we got here
today
Mr President thank you so much for your
leadership on this budget I appreciate
your trust in me your trust in our staff
thank you for being so very involved
from the get-go as we discussed
particularly issues concerning Mental
Health
and hope and your commitment this body
would stay at 100 for the Hope
Scholarship
I know our staff's listening I want to
tell them thank you again I want to say
thank you to Chairman Hatchett for his
work and to OPP direct OPB director Farr
and his team for the work they've put in
I hope this is a budget that you can
feel
reflects matters in your district and
things that your constituents have
brought to you
Mr President with that I will yield for
questions or if there are no questions I
will yield thee will you do have some
questions Senator recognize senator from
the second
does the distinguish Appropriations
chair yield yes sir
Senator I've got a just a few questions
uh being a Freshman Senator I'm
intrigued by what you said about the
carry forward balance from the
University system of Georgia and I'm
always ever concerned about the agencies
that have you know half a billion
dollars like the lottery
USG can you talk and explain potentially
how they have so much money and how did
they get it because I thought all
dollars had to be appropriated by this
body and so I'm just trying to figure
out how did they get a surplus of
504 million dollars yeah um well the
carry forward fund report which I
brought up here I think I might have to
bring it up here and talk about it
before it has been emailed out to each
one of you it is sitting in your inbox
right now so if you want to look at that
report you can you'll see that the
second page lays out each University
page five lays out the balances and how
they got there some of them charge
tuition some of them charge technology
fees some charge indirect recovery costs
department sales and services and over
and they're allowed to keep those funds
we passed a bill that you remember the
former senator from the 37th opposed
greatly uh Senator tippins I think we
can say his name if he's no longer a
senator who said hey we need to really
focus in on this and where this
funding's going and that those funds
total right now about 504 million
further questions sir uh with a carry
forward funds does that money stay with
the university system or is it at the
institution
um kind of can you explain that to me
because when I look at
section uh article 8 section four
dealing with the Board of Regents and
the university system could you explain
that a little bit too as well thank you
uh it's at each University if you get
the carry forward report you'll see how
much is at your University uh in each
one and I I know Savannah State is
obviously on your lapel pin that's one
that would matter to you it's going to
be at page 80
86 you can see how much they have in
carry forward funds some schools have
more than others and if you look at uh
carry forward funds for in October 2022
for Savannah State it's going to be
roughly and I'm going to add them up
across the bottom 2.4 plus 720 it's
going to be roughly 3.4 that 500 will
leave it at three point uh six they're
going to have almost 4 million dollars
if I've Done Quick math and carry
forward funds there now they're going to
have plans for using them but they have
I'd say roughly 4 million dollars at
Savannah State
article one section 8 that you asked
about specifically article one section 8
is extremely clear and I'm glad you
brought that up
there's a lot of comments about that
this will be disproportionately
impactful to home smaller schools
that does not have to be the case
you see what you brought up article
eight
says that when we give money to the
Board of Regents the Board of Regents
are in charge of how that will be done
it's essentially a block grant so while
you do see budgetary items and titles
teaching Skidaway Island other things
under the Regent's budget those things
are program areas but we block Granite
to USG they could spend it honestly any
way they want if they come outside of a
program area they will get an audit a
ding from the auditor they'll send them
a nasty letter and say you're supposed
to be in this in this program area but
overall they are constitutionally
allowed to spend that money when it
comes to them as they please
my
final question Senator so with what
you're saying uh from article eight is
that uh if the distinguished senator of
Appropriations were to want to support
Savannah State University and many of
our other hbcus in the state of Georgia
we would just essentially be giving a
block grant of money to the university
system of Georgia and they may or may
not spend that money as we intended is
that is that kind of what you explain it
to me Senator that that's one way of
saying it I think it I think you're
saying it in the reverse that I was
saying it but both would be true that we
now in the past USG has we've separated
out those program areas and they've
stayed in those program areas but if USG
specifically in the teaching program
which is where the 66 million reduction
is if they wanted to say we're not going
to apply this evenly across all schools
we're not going to apply it by the
teaching formula we're not going to
apply it by square footage we're going
to look at how much you have and carry
forward funds and apply it commiserately
to that they absolutely can do that
within the teaching area and they won't
even get an audit report on that but but
we can't tell them to do that
that's their constitutional building
recognize senator from the 29th
thank you Mr President does The
Honorable Appropriations chair yield
thank you yes yes uh Mr chairman I
appreciate the support of the Timber
industry that you and your staff and and
the house staff have have done in
creating this budget but look I'm just a
simple guy from Middle Georgia
and when I look at the universities I
think about education so could you help
me understand exactly how much money in
this budget do we budget for the
teaching in the classroom the education
that we pay to send our uh kids to
University in the state of Georgia so
you're asking about University teaching
specifically that would be about that
would be about 2.8 billion dollars for
teaching it's just teaching the just the
teaching formula is 2.8 billion dollars
so the reduction there of 66 it's
actually if you want to get to specifics
it's
2.868 billion dollars so the reduction
that we're making is is in the third
decimals over there
um
the if you want to talk about USG as a
whole though it's going to be around 3.1
billion dollars thank you Senator that's
right just to keep follow up on that if
you want to look at total funds not
State funds it's going to be 9 billion
dollars about 2.2 billion from tuition
recognize the senator from the 14th
thank you Mr President as a senator
yield yes sir uh I share some of the
subject matter interests of my
colleagues from like a comparative
perspective I'm curious you know in
contrast to the Border Regents how much
State funding goes to our technical
schools good question it's actually
about a half a million dollars I think
it's a half a million exactly this year
so that would be if you're using State
funds to State funds so three billion
dollar State funds to USG versus half a
billion dollars 500 million dollars to
tcsg it'll be roughly 1 6. if you want
to go further than that though you'd
look at total funds that's going to be
roughly one billion one billion dollars
at tcsg to nine billion dollars of T of
USG so it'd be a one to nine okay thank
you for that perspective Senator no
problem this is actually the questions
we ask in the back rooms I never thought
I'd get asked up here let's keep going
recognize the senator from the 50.
thank you Mr President does the senator
yield yes sir could you uh kind of help
me and go into just some detail about um
the other things that we fund at Regents
sure we fund AG extension we fund
libraries we fund uh vet labs in Athens
and Tifton we fund the Skidaway Island
Ocean research facility and at USG we
fund forestry extension we fund teaching
I think I already said Skidaway Island I
can keep going there's a lot of things
recognize the senator from the 21st
and those are in addition to teaching
thank you thank you Mr President
chairman you yes sir chairman thank you
for all your hard work you the conferees
and your whole staff
um just one question does the Board of
Regents get hope money too
Yes actually so then if you turn in your
budget in student finance and you were
to go to
um hope public that's going to be about
885 million so on top of the 3 billion
in state general funds The Hope public
almost all of that's going to come two
regions it's going to go to the
individual schools based on tuition but
yes sir that's an additional 885 million
yeah freaking as a senator from the 53rd
thank you Mr President will the senator
yield yes sir uh isn't it true that
Regents is the only Department that can
retain its funds from tuitions and fees
yes with a codicil let me give you the
cottestyle so they are allowed by state
legislation that we pass in the former
center from the 37th vehemently opposed
until the end I think they may have made
a deal there at the end they get to keep
their carry forward funds by Statute
other agencies are going to have to ask
OPB for permission to keep that
authorities keep their carry forward
funds like uh Georgia Congress Center
and so those keep us just uh student
finance Authority they keep that but yes
sir the Regents is different it's not an
authority and it does get to keep that
504 million yes sir
recognize the senator from the 54th
thank you Mr President Senator yield yes
sir thank you my friend um are there any
restrictions on the Board of Regents
some is regard to spending
as long as it's legal no and I'd go I'd
point you back to article eight when the
monies come to them they can allocate
them if they wanted to give every single
dollar to South Georgia College they
could if they wanted to give every
dollar to USG they could they obviously
won't but they have the ability those
members who are appointed pointed by
each congressional district and the
chancellor and the USG central office
have the ability to allocate the funding
that comes to the teaching program
specifically but the Regents as a whole
however they desire
thank you thank you
recognize the senator from the 30th
thank you Mr President this is a
chairman yield yes sir so I'm trying to
follow you here I haven't heard anything
about foundations here
um yeah I know that there are some of
the schools are they at all the schools
under the regents
that's a great question I don't know I
know many of some have multiple
foundations but I don't know that every
school necessarily has a foundation I I
don't know that number I know some have
multiple
okay that's the only thing foundations
would be the only way they the
additional way that the schools would be
getting Revenue into them that's a
that's an additional point so they would
be able to raise I know a lot of schools
raise uh Foundation funds and they also
use Foundation sometimes to do real
estate purchases Etc
a real estate like a sub entity under a
foundation
or a sub entity under the university yes
sir okay all right thank you yeah we we
don't I can't tell you how much in those
funds I'm not aware of any report of
that
not that I know of recognize senator
from the 31st
I think Mr President Senator we yield
yes sir is it not true the region
subunits May owe more property than the
actual regions themselves you must have
been talking with the senator from the
30th I I have heard that but I do not
know it uh but you're correct that I
would not have a way to know it I do not
know of a report that I have I may have
a report but I'm not aware of any report
that tells us about the subunits and the
foundations and what they own it could
exist if it does I apologize I do not
know about it so there's so there's
potentially not a report that tracks
public property
going back to some of these institutions
now we're going to a great discussion
that we have in budget we actually have
had a discussion and a question raised
for us as to whether or not we have
liability for those properties that are
owned by foundations that might be what
you're getting at I don't know that has
been raised for us because we don't know
about it we don't know but would the end
user be a university and thus the state
of Georgia since it is owned by a
subunit of a university I think that's a
very good legal question that we would
need to know the answer to
consider you yield for one more question
yes sir is it not true that yours truly
used to cheer maybe not in the
University system but a foundation in
tcsg and I in in one zone property
through the merging of several colleges
this is not true that we've seen
foundations historically get out of the
property business because of potential
liabilities
um but senator may know of what he
speaks I don't I've never started on one
of those foundations but thank you for
the knowledge you bring to the chamber
recognize senator from the 11th
thank you Mr President uh Mr chairman
yield yes sir
Mr chairman can the Board of Regents
enter into contracts without the the
purview or permission of the legislative
body yes
they can article 8 specifically allows
that I think that was part of the
discussion that's been in this chamber
the only
Avenue of involvement we have is the
budget
recognize senator from the six
thank you Mr President does the
gentleman in your yes sir uh related to
the senator from the 11th question
there has been talk about a mou between
WellStar and Augusta University
would that come before the legislature
because it's a state property like other
state property deals
it would not it would never come here
the only purview we would have or the
only involvement we would have would be
the budget
recognize senator from the eighth
thank you Mr President the senator to
you yes sir I've heard that there are
over 25 employees of USG that make over
750 000 a year is that true
so you would be going back to an audit
report from 2020 or 2021 it's not
open.georgia.gov you can look up how
much each one of us makes some of my
constituents do it and laugh at our um
well it's 17 000 salary not twenty two
thousand dollar salary but if you ran
that report they're probably talking
about them running that report in 2021
and in 2021 it would have showed over
20. I don't know if it's over 25 uh
people at USG that make over 750 000 now
they're going to be some are going to be
doctors at auhs some are going to be I
mean Kirby's smart will be one of them
um
and then he's going to be paid by state
funds and then Foundation funds senator
from the 30th talked about I think his
State funds at the time was like 779
000.
um but there were others as well that
aren't a UHS or uh or Kirby Smart
senator for the yield yes sir so those
salaries those are taxpayer funds right
probably
some could be at least with Kirby Smart
you know he's getting Foundation dollars
on top of that I don't know if those are
all State dollars or not
um but there is a state dollar mix
yes sir I guess that kind of goes you
know the thing institutions and I guess
USG set their own compensation policies
so we don't have any purview into that
recognize senator from the 47th
thank you Mr President I said then yeah
with the senator yield yes sir
one of the things I just got to ask when
we start talking about Coach smart don't
you think that's a great investment for
the state of Georgia to keep winning
that National Championship every year no
dogs
they uh I'm not hearing a go dogs back I
know you you went school over there said
they uh twice twice they uh but one of
the things that uh several years ago we
Exempted the the university uh
themselves from from falling in as quote
lobbyists but but don't most of these uh
universities have somebody that's a
professional that that's representing
their interest because for me when I'm
listening to to this discussion I'm here
and Time After Time After Time how much
money we're putting into this and I
think it's working I think those folks
that are that don't most of these
universities have an actual government
liaison that is working for us
Senator did you just ask me does do most
universities have a lobbyist is that
what you just asked me well in so many
terms we don't call them lobbyists yes
they uh thank you Mr chairman said they
uh uh just remember that that investment
over in Athens it's worthwhile yes sir
recognize senator from the 17th
thank you Mr President chairman yield
yes sir
um chairman when it comes to the
security Ford funds is there any sort of
oversight or accountability as as to
what happens that money spent by these
schools
none to my knowledge and again the
former senator from the 37th spent a lot
of time beating that point I think this
chamber did too we do get that report in
we got in October of this year that
shows how they spent the previous year
it lays out how they intend to spend the
next year besides that that report we do
not have any say in that setting no we
don't if that's what you're asking and
do we have uh do we have the do we audit
them the next year to make sure they
spin it the way they said the year
before we we it will be just reading the
year's reports and seeing and comparing
the reports
we're gonna have a senator from the 52nd
thank you Mr President with the chairman
yield yes sir uh first of all we really
appreciate the job you're doing for the
Senate you make us proud
this carryover fund you and I were both
County Commissioners and we had fund
balances which I kind of see this as the
same thing as a carry forward fund and
some gears we added to it some years we
took away
how much what percentage of this fund
would they have to use to fully fund
what they're requesting for here the
additional 66 million
so you can do quick math 66 million
they have 504 and carry four funds as of
October I don't know if that number's up
with spring tuition or down uh it could
be lower could be higher but if you just
use the October figure and remember the
October figure for this year was 504 the
previous year it was 550 so um
66 million whatever percentage that is
the 504 is that going to be around 11
ish 12.
yes sir put me on the spot doing numbers
thank you
recognize senator from the 49th
thank you Mr President do you yield yes
sir
can we avoid that
senator from the 49th I think you've hit
on the point that uh many of the members
here I think are driving home with their
questions which is it does not have to
and that question is left up to USG in
the Board of Regents if they want to
apply it across the board I'm sure
schools that are smaller with less carry
forward funds are going to be impacted
more but if they want to apply it
different differently they are not only
allowed to they are constitutionally
empowered to
recognize the senator from the 13th
chairman you yes sir
Mr chairman uh Atco Cinemas everybody
thank you and your team and uh
Appropriations Committee for the work
you've done Mighty impressive question
for you yeah make me understand this so
the decision
about how teaching reductions will be
made are you saying it rests slowly with
the board of real regents yes it rests
solely with the Board of Regents yes
thank you recognize senator from the
22nd
thank you Mr President Senator Yale yes
sir first want to thank you for your
help with the Augusta judicial circuit
issue and hopefully next year we can get
that pushed through but thank you for
everything you did there my question
goes back to block grants because I'm
actually kind of still kind of wondering
how that process works is there ability
for the reasons to actually get blocked
grants from the legislature and how does
that kind of work there yeah I think
again we're still talking about that
article eight issue the funding that
comes from the legislature pursuant to
article eight is by article Eight's
reading a block grant now if they do
spend those items within different
program areas of our budget that's laid
out with the big thick black lines they
will get a nasty letter from the auditor
but in the line we're talking about the
teaching line with the 66 million dollar
reduction there's over there's what did
I say it was 2.8 is a billion
and at a 3.1
so the percentage here I think we're
talking about is again
um
much less than other agencies have seen
recognize senator from the 16th
thank you Mr President chairman yield
yes sir thank you for all you do great
job of putting all the paperwork
together and everything as I listen to
what you've said and listened to the and
what I can read the Board of Regents
would get roughly over three billion
dollars plus another
885 million from Hope is that is that a
correct number yeah that's a fair way to
look at it it's 3 billion in state funds
which when they run through other
federal funds and tuitions Etc ends up
being about 9 billion and then and that
9 billion would include the Hope funds
hope public which is 885 million yes sir
it's almost 4 billion yes sir close
thank you
and I hope that folks when they talk
about with our state spending over the
years has decline they will look at that
hope number too those are I would say
State spending
recognize the senator from the 28th
thank you Mr President
Mr chairman do you yield yes sir to the
distinguished rules chairman so we've
been throwing some numbers around today
and I just if you will I want to make
sure I understand this so
the Board of Regents is getting three
billion dollars
in the budget
and
they're getting
885 million from Hope is that that'd be
the public hope number yes sir okay
and if you'll further your yield so
they're also able to do this carry
forward funds of what about 500 plus
million dollars yes sir is that accurate
okay so they get all that and then
and then they get tuition on top of all
that
yes
um two billion is 2.2 billion in tuition
I I do think that though that tuition
number and the Hope public number can be
squeezed together those might be kind of
overlaying so I want to be fair to them
there but you've laid that out besides
the 885 sort of being in the tuition the
885 hope public being intuition the rest
of that is accurate
well thanks Senator that's a lot of
money
recognize senator from the 56.
thank you Mr President Mr chairman yield
yes sir
Mr chairman I'm just trying to make sure
I've got all the numbers together too I
think you mentioned that on top of three
billion dollars that we've spent in
state funds and 885 million more in Hope
funds
and 504 million more in carry forward
funds aren't we also funding several
buildings for the University system as
well yes sir could you help elaborate
tell me what that looks like yeah let me
go back to that first seat I let down um
I'm gonna do rough numbers because I
didn't write these down I apologize and
thank you uh Georgia state's roughly 50
million Kennesaw State's roughly 50
million Columbus State Dalton State
University of Georgia's main University
of North Georgia's main campus Georgia
Southern East Georgia College Georgia
Southwestern
UGA College of Coastal Georgia Albany
State University of West Georgia Georgia
College and State University uh
all of those at least that's just this
year
Senator final question if I added that
numbers together that seems like it's
maybe north of four and a half billion
dollars is that not about right
taking the public hope
USG that that's I haven't done those
numbers yet but that sounds like it
could be fair
recognize senator from the 46.
thank you Mr President will the chairman
yield yes sir you don't mind it's gonna
be the last one for the University of
Georgia here in the universities system
uh I've been hearing from my people back
home and I'm still an advocate that I
mean y'all better not be messing with
Kirby Smart's money here I heard you
mention him but I think our University
system provides about the best
educational opportunities in the country
and yes sir with hope I know we're the
Envy of everybody I want to make sure
we're not
unnecessarily harming
our our entire University system here I
keep hearing all these numbers of course
I was crunching them all afternoon when
this is on our desk is
somewhere North of 60 million they're
claiming our Cuts but y'all keep saying
we got 3 billion in the teaching budget
you got 800 and something million in
Hope
you got this 500 million that got in
reserves what kind of percentage are we
cutting from them if you
I hadn't added on there's one line in
here said there's nine billion dollars
in education I think that has federal
funds too
this treasure we have in our state
three billion 885 the 504 carry forward
66 million dollar reduction of all those
Mr chairman I have that being at 1.5
percent
does the house agree with this these
Cuts this is a conference committee
report Mr chairman so yes sir is by both
Chambers
all right we thank you for your efforts
Mr President there are no more questions
and maybe even if there are I yield the
will
Senator has yielded the whale
[Applause]
Senators yielded the well and uh we need
to thank our Appropriations chair for a
fantastic job that he did throughout
this whole process
uh and uh I think he and the
Appropriations chair from the house work
very well together and uh and I think
they did a good job of of bringing this
budget home now so I appreciate uh
appreciate the center from the 19th hard
work and I also appreciate his staff
they've been working a lot of long hours
the last couple weeks and they deserve a
lot of credit as well so thank you very
much Senator thank you for your
continued work on on this and and we
appreciate all your hard work you'd make
you'd make the Senator Senator uh Hill
very proud I can tell you that so
does any other Senator speak for or
against the motion
chair here's nine senator
from the 19th he's already closed debate
the question is on the adoption of the
conference committee report on HB 19 all
those in favor of adopting the
conference committee report will vote
yay opposed nay secretary unlock the
machine
almost perfect again I tell you what
my good friend from the mountains up
there on the passage of the of the
motion the A's r54 the Nays are one the
motion has prevailed
and the Senate has adopted the
conference could be reported on HB 19.
congratulations senator
senator from the 14th what purpose do
you rise well Mr President I'd like to
make a motion
what's your motion Senator well seeing
that the Senate has accomplished its one
constitutional Duty for the session I
move Mr President
that this Senate stand adjourned sign a
die
your emotion is in order senator
senator from the 19th what purpose you
rise Parliament or anchor Mr President
what state's inquiry bingo
stand at ease I'm going to talk to our
leadership team real quick
Senate come back to order
the Senate could come back to order
the center from the 14th has made a
motion to adjourn and as he or Sani die
uh and as he uh pointed out we have
completed our only constitutional
obligation here tonight so this is a
debatable motion and uh recognize the
senator from the 14th speak to it
distinguished members of the Senate
there Comes A Time In The Life and the
working
schedule
of every chamber
when it's simply time to go home
and further to that if you're a member
of the minority in this chamber and you
watch with fomo
every time a member of the majority gets
to make a special motion or agree to
this or disagree to that you think when
do I get to play when is it finally my
turn when you look at a bingo card
prepared by the Twitter ID and you see
that there is a blank that is yet to be
scratched off it is in these moments
colleagues
when young and enterprising Senators
must stand forward and do before 5 30 PM
what few members are willing to do and
that is to move that this body adjourns
Sani die and that's why I did it and I'm
not sorry I did it
Mr President I'm happy to heal the
questions on this special motion
you have no questions Senator thank you
Mr President I yield the well and I urge
your favorable consideration
I I reckon I recognize I recognize the
proteom centered from the 18th speak to
the measure
well thank you I guess Mr President I'm
not sure
so I find myself perplexed we don't
usually get this kind of motion but he
is a freshman the center from the 14th
and sometimes he speaks as if he knows
of which he's saying
and sometimes he speaks as if he
understands what he's saying even when
we don't understand what he's saying
but I think there are merits to this
motion we have done the one
constitutional duty of this body
and I think we need to give serious
consideration to the motion
but then I'm really conflicted because
that would require me to agree with the
senator from the 14th
and that causes me great angst
but the one thing that we would really
the burning question of on everyone's
mind of every distinguished member of
this body is
how would the senator from the 53rd vote
how would he vote no
and the possibility of gaining the
answer to that question almost is
delicious enough to make me want to
support this motion and ask that we
haven't voted on
but with that I know we have other
distinguished members and Leadership
that may want to speak to that
so as others have said
you know sometimes my friends are for it
and sometimes they're against it but I'm
always for my friends so that would be
my answer to you senator from the 14th
whatever that means
and I suspect that's about as
understandable as some of the things you
have said from this well during this
Sith session thank you I do yield the
well all right
all right
[Applause]
Madam leader do you would you like to
speak
is the motion brought forward by your
caucus
yes it was thank you Mr President
members of the Senate and all our
special guests
this is how we conduct business in the
state of Georgia
we passed the budget

senator from the 19th you did a great
job thank you so much for honoring our
request
but now it's time to go home
all in favor
Mr President Putin oh
Jokes Aside
we really appreciate our families coming
down here and standing around the wall
until midnight
my daughters here and her good friend
that she works with her colleague my
great-grandson is paging today I hope
you all met him
but as far as going home
I think we ought to stay here and do the
people's work
senator from the 35th encouraged me
and said she really want to work
so Mr President I think all you of the
well and
maybe we could have dinner first before
we finish
thank you Mr President I yield I was
getting excited there Senator I mean we
were about to have less bills and a
balanced budget I thought we're about to
have a conversion here
um
senator from the 14th you used to have
something else you'd like to have well
Mr President I uh have an open mind
foreign
and I can be persuaded if the if the
debate so calls me to change my mind and
I've also learned important lesson this
session Mr President has to follow my
leader uh and if my leader wants to stay
in work uh then I will respectfully ask
to withdraw my motion
withdraw his motion all right
all right
recognize the majority leader part of
material inquiry say to your inquiry
isn't a true that we haven't passed a
gambling bill this session but I was
about to call his bluff on this vote

there Senator you never know I'm just
kidding I'm just kidding so
I wouldn't bet on it though but
all right well since he's withdrawn the
motion I guess we'll we'll just keep
