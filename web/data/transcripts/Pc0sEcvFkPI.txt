As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 161st House District Representative Bill Hitchens. Chairman Hitchens. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I think as everybody knows from yesterday and today we're at the Capitol and I'm proud today to bring another Effingham County in up here to be the preacher today. I don't attend his church but we both live in rural Effingham County and he lives about two miles down the road. I know he never suspects that I'm going to say this but I rode by his house Saturday and there was a dead coyote in his front in the road in front of his house and we were just talking to our weams over here about it and now say well not only is there good preacher, he must be a good shot too. Reverend Monge in about six months ago invited me to come to his church. He's the pastor of the first Baptist church in Poehl-Worth Georgia right down the road from the Savannah Port and they celebrated their hundredth anniversary. Along with me he invited Chairman Stevens who grew up in that church and my predecessor here and now the congressman from the first district Buddy Carter and I was certainly surprised that they had old they had people there that attended that church for decades and they had the everybody that had been in the choir get up to sing and I was kind of surprised. I'd never heard that out of Ron but Ron got up there and sang in the choir like he used to when he was a youngster. But Reverend Monge in as I said he lives right down the road from me. He's one of those people who worked all his life. He actually retired with 38 years from Georgia Pacific before he began to preach full time but he holds a bachelor's degree in business administration from Bruton Parker College, a master's degree in religion from Liberty University, a master's degree in divinity from Liberty University and is currently a P.E. Steak candidate at Columbia International University. We're joined today with his wife Tammy, stand up Tammy. Tammy worked for the Effingham County Board of Education for many years and retired and my daughter worked in the same office with her and John Burns wife worked for the Board of Education too so they all know each other. In addition they have their son Graham with them today. Pastor Monge and has been very active in the community for many years and a lot of respects with the Special Olympics United Way and all those things that being a good Christian have afforded him opportunities and our speaker always gives me a lot of problems about talking too long. So I'm gonna cut it short today and I'm gonna save a little time for the preacher so with that I want to do preacher Paul Monge. Thank you Bill. That's a tough act to follow right there. It is a great thrill for me to be here today and see my wife and son applauded by you as another great thrill so thank you very much for making all of us welcome but I want to thank Representative Bill Hitchens as well as Speaker Burns and all of you distinguished Georgia leaders for inviting me here today. Bill and I have a long relationship with one another having first met in 1977 by the side of the road on Highway 21 south of Rankin, Georgia. I don't know how Bill was at the time but I was a 19 year old kid getting my first speed and ticket. It ain't that funny. I did my best to talk him out of it but he wasn't having none of it. Anyway he didn't have a lot of mercy on me. Actually it did me a lot of good but I was more afraid of telling my dad about that in counter on the side of the road than I was of getting that ticket. So his fate would have it. Bill and our neighbors we live just a few miles from one another and we have enjoyed a good relationship and as you can see everything works out in the end. My message today is focused around this passage of scripture but I'm not going to reference it again other than to give you a context. And in Matthew chapter 20 verse 25 the Bible says this but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercised dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant. Even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. Today as we look at what Jesus had to say unto his disciples those words still have great meaning to all of us here in this chamber. In this passage Jesus is reminding his followers that we are to obey the laws of the land and respect those who govern over us. I don't need to remind any of you.

of the tumultuous world we live in today, nor the deep divisions that seem to permeate our society. What is missing today is our spiritual frame of reference and a true reverence for God. Jesus is reminding His disciples that all of us, that it is incumbent for us, especially you great leaders here in this room, to perform five essential elements of leadership. The first thing all of you, all leaders should do, is to model the way. Leaders lead from the front. And as leaders, you know that you are set, you set the proper example by clarifying your values and then articulating those values so that others see what you believe in, what you hold dear and what you value the most. A leader that models the way, sets themselves up as the example for others to follow and is confident, courageous and dedicated to their cause. Jesus Christ was exactly this type of leader when He stated in John 14, 6, Jesus saith unto them, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man come unto the Father but by me. Second, you are to inspire a shared vision. A leader has to have a vision for each of you here, as leaders, you have a vision for each of you here today and are visionary leaders. You have visions for your communities, your districts and for our state. You believe in your calls and those strong beliefs are the driving force that inspires your vision. This governing body is charged with moving our state forward and from my perspective in South Georgia, things are moving at light and speed. The Old Testament, Monoprof at Habakkuk, knew about vision and gave us these verses in Habakkuk chapter two, verse two. And the Lord answered me and said, write the vision and make it plain upon tables that He may run that read of it. And the vision is yet for a point of time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie, though it Terry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not Terry. Third, leaders are to challenge the process, historically any leader that we truly remember and all of those we admire were the ones that defined the defied convention and challenged the status quo. Many of our founding fathers were rebels, troublemakers and some of them were even rascals, but all of them made a difference. We are living in a rapidly changing technological age and we have to take advantage of those new processes and procedures and move this state and country forward for the good of all of us. The young boy David stood before the giant Goliath and challenged him with great faith. In 1 Samuel 17, verse 45, the Bible tells us and then David said to the Philistine, thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of host and the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou defiest. With God, you can accomplish anything. Fourthly, leaders are to enable others to act. Exemplary leaders are leaders that can recognize the talents and others and then empower them and empower those people to do extraordinary things. These transformative leaders are great leaders because they know they cannot do everything nor be everything to everybody. An exemplary leader will build trust among their constituencies and foster lasting relationships that enable those around them to overcome, overcheath and to outperform the competition. These types of leaders are winners. We are told in the book of Proverbs how to enable others to act. Proverbs chapter three, verse 27, with whole not good from them to whom it is due and when it is the power of thine hand to do it. And lastly, you are to encourage the heart. As leaders, you know quite well that your tenure here in this great chamber is limited and a privilege. Your fellow citizens have trusted you and believed in you to represent them with trust and honor. Each of you are entrusted with a great op responsibility and let me publicly state a word of gratitude for your service here today. But remember that you don't get to this position alone. Many others made sacrifices for you to hold this office that you lead today. And those back home have high expectations and hopes. So reward your constituents with a sound judgment, wise counsel and godly convictions. The Bible tells us in Psalms 28.7, the Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart trusted in him and I am helped. Therefore, my heart greatly rejoiced and with my song, while I praise him, let us pray. Our Heavenly Father, we come here today and Lord, we are grateful. We are grateful that your presence is here. And Lord, we are grateful for each one of these leaders who represent the great state of Georgia. Lord, we are grateful that you are shining your grace upon Georgia and Lord, we ask for your mercy. And Lord, today, as this chamber will go through their daily business, I pray that you will be with each one and that Lord that you will convict them to lead with a godly spirit, but Lord, I pray that you will bless them with wisdom and that Lord that you will have your spirit with them today. We thank you, Lord, for their service and we pray for your blessings and Christ's name, amen. Thank you, Lee. Thank you. Doorkeep is well, unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south any room, south any room. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.

All right. Members will please, members will please take your seats. Come to order. I have some important information for you. We'll take your seats. Come to order. We're moving on to morning orders. Morning orders. Chair will now recognize Chairman Jasper's and Representative Vance Smith for a very important morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Along with my friend, Representative Vance Smith, we have a great honor today. Today is Kia Day. And on your desk, you'll see this lovely Kia Serrento made right here in Georgia. It's one of four models. They make it this vast plant. They also make the spornage, the K-5, and the award-winning telluride. You will have the opportunity someday. I hope to take a tour of the Kia Manufacturing Plant. Take advantage of that opportunity. It's fabulous. You will be so impressed and I hope you go. You know, I was thinking about this. I know it was very exciting for the state when Kia came to Georgia. It's hard to imagine back in 2009 when Kia came to West Point, what would happen in that community? Kia has been a great partner in our state. There's invested $1.9 billion in Georgia. Currently has over 3,000 team members working in our state. You know, members, we talk about manufacturing a lot, but I'm also going to make sure you understand that since 2018, Georgia has welcomed over 125 auto industry projects, investing $24.6 billion in our state. You know, Kia, thank you. Kia is committed to electric vehicles. It focused on becoming a leader in electric mobility, and being our partner in making Georgia the electric vehicle manufacturing state. Thank you, Miss Speaker and thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's quite an honor for me to be here. Van Smith, I represent Harris County, part of Muscogee, part of Troop County. And this is where Kia is located, and I can't tell you how proud we are to have a facility, such as Kia in our district. They're very involved in the community, have invested millions of dollars in our local community, and think academy, career academy, and it's just quite an honor. Our young people, when they graduate from school, now can find an excellent job working at this Kia facility. And as the chairman mentioned, some 3,000 employees just there, not counting all the spin-off companies in the local industrial park in Harris County, Troop County, Marrioweather County, so it has a huge effect on West Central Georgia. I'd like to ask you, as my fellow members of the House, at this time, if you would give a warm welcome to President Noon to Mr. Stewart County, it's the President of Kia. Y'all stand up. Applause Gentlemen, thank you very, very much, and I hope when you see them in the hall, and the whole honorisest with them, and you see that Kia emblem. Thank them for being here. Join us tonight from 5 to 7, at the College Football Hall of Fame, Kia is putting on a recession for us there, so I hope you'll make your way by and say hello and say thank you to them. And thank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Applause If I may add, gentlemen, to the Kia Motor Group, thank you, thank you, thank you for your investment in Georgia over the years, not only producing a wonderful product, but also a wonderful product that is recognized in this country and worldwide, but the care you have for your employees and the people and the communities around your facilities is remarkable. And it does not go unnoticed. We appreciate your contribution to Georgia, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the future. Thank you so much for being here, and thank you for your patience this morning as well. Thank you. Applause Chair, we now recognize Representative Stacy Evans to present our Doctor of the Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I am very excited to welcome Dr. Umanen to the state capital. She is a board-certified neurologist and epileptologist. She is the chief of neurology at Morehouse School of Medicine. She completed her medical training in India, followed by a residency in internal medicine from Jamaica, and then completed her residency in neurology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, followed by a fellowship in neurophysiology from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. She has worked at Tulane University, got an MBA in health care from George Washington University, did a fellowship in epilepsy at Yale University, and has also worked at the Oshner Medical Center. And now we are very excited to have her here in Atlanta at the Morehouse School of Medicine. Dr. Umanen was awarded fellow status by the American Epilepsy Society and the American Clinical Neurosphysiology Society, and she is the current chair of the Education section of the Ideas Task Force. That is inclusion, diversity, equity, anti-racism, and social justice. She is involved in teaching and has been throughout her career and has published extensively. She will be starting a neurology residency training program at Morehouse School of Medicine shortly. And if she is in the gallery, I would ask her to please stand so that we can welcome her to the state capital, but in any event we are very happy she is here. If you have any medical needs today, I know that she will be very happy to attend to you. Thank you. Thank you, Representative, and thanks to Dr. Minnan for being here today and taking care of us. Chair now recognizes Chairman Gerald Green for a morning order. Mr. Speaker, I will have several others join me at the podium if that is all right. And Mr. Speaker, I'm checking in that I was at your reception last night. Very good reception for Effingham Canning. It's noted. Thank you. This morning, the House is honored to recognize a group of distinguished teachers. They are receiving the Don Cargill Stem Scholarship Award. These teachers that we honor today demonstrate a passion to provide students with innovative and challenging STEM experiences. They engage their students' capacity to learn and build confidence, not only in their ability to master STEM, but to master lessons of successful living. Teachers chosen for this honor receive $500 to outfit their STEM classroom. In this year, we have 23 teachers from across Georgia who have received this award. But before I ask those teachers to stand, let me direct your attention to these awards our name for. Don, would you please stand? Don. Don. Don was a lobbyist who is now retired 41 years here at the Outstate Capital. Many of us were under his tutelage when we came here. Don took this country boy and he carried me to the finest restaurant here in Atlanta when I first got here. And the barstie was very good. But Don has been very instrumental. He was the first board chairman and now Amanda Busy is there. And one of the best lobbyists that you have is Betsy Green who really looks after this group. Let me now introduce the House to the members that are receiving this award. Would they please stand? Thank you so much. Thank you for what you do for our students throughout Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to those who are recognized. Don Corgill, my dear friend. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your contribution to mankind. You're a great man. You're a great Georgian who's cared for lots and lots of folks. And we just wish you the best. And thank you for gracing us here in the House with your presence today. Thank you so much. And God bless you. Chair now recognizes Representative Victor Anderson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I don't think it goes unnoticed that the decisions and the ideas deliberated in this chamber have an effect on the future of the state of Georgia and in many cases our nation. Today I would like to introduce you to part of that future. I'm honored today to introduce the Raven County or Forward Raven Youth Leadership Group. And if y'all will please stand. I think we're up here on the right-hand side, yeah. These are representatives from three different school systems, the Raven County School System, Tolulu Falls School, and Rabighap, Nacucci School. They'll be spending part of today with us. So if you see them in the halls, thank them for being here. And thank you all for coming. Chair now recognizes two important members of this body. I'll let them tell you a little bit about the work we're going to recognize them for today and what they're doing, folks here recognizing. Representative Mary Margaret Oliver and Representative Todd Jones. Y'all are recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon colleagues and everyone in the gallery. For those of you who do not know today is Mental Health Day at the Georgia State Capitol. We hope that you join us at 1115 at the South Steps. But before we leave you today, Mary Margaret, pardon me, Representative Oliver and I, wanted to leave you with a couple of thoughts. Speaker Ralston was, gave us to privilege the honor of carrying House Bill 1013. And one of the things that he continued to impress upon us every time we met with him was that 2022 may have been the year of mental health. But we need to make this the decade of mental health and substance abuse. Thank you, colleagues. We are working diligently and being able to provide you with what we believe. We don't want to use the phrase clean up. We don't want to use the phrase other than we want to build on the foundation that you helped us make. For those of you who are in the chamber last year and we had full bipartisan support if you recall, we say thank you. For those of you who are not in the chamber, we look forward to working with you and hoping that we can gain your support for this year's bill. Thank you so much, John. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also want to thank the patients and the families and all of the staff members that are out there in Georgia today helping take care of folks that are suffering every day with a severe mental health. Not long after Governor Kemp signed 1013, I was called by now Commissioner Kevin Tanner and given specific directions on how to proceed through the summer with all the subcommittee work that had begun and created 1013. We have met all summer, all of the meetings and all of the exhibits are online and available to you and we look forward to perfecting legislation with you, particularly on the area of workforce which we know is a challenge every place in Georgia. We are expanding the loan forgiveness program with your approval. We are working again on licensure barriers to get more folks at work. There are many different issues we'll bring for you in the next few weeks and months and thank you, thank you for all your help and cooperation and good work and support. Thank you, representatives. I don't, this house is proud of a lot of work we've done over the years but I can say to both of you your work last year in the work of this house and Speaker Ralston is and will continue to make a difference in this state for so many citizens of our state and our families for years to come. The work is not completed. We still have work to do but thanks to both of you and thanks to the folks who are here today to help let us honor them and be a part of this day so thank you both, appreciate both of you and we still will continue to work. Thank you. Chairman Heath Clark, I saw you. There he is. Former member of this house, Chairman Heath Clark is here with us today with some folks from down home. That's a welcome Chairman Clark. We mails may as well get the other one. Chairman Westcanned Trail, glad to have you back, former member of this house. He survived being the champion of the day in the Senate so we welcome you back. We're glad you're back to the guys house over here. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Chair now recognizes Representative Blackman, Noel Williams, Ballard and Dickie for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Along with former chairman Heath Clark, we are excited to have some young leaders from our House of County School System representing the Robbins region Youth Leadership Group. If y'all would stand and let us welcome you to the People's House. Thank you very much. Members, thank you for your attention to those important announcements and those morning orders. I appreciate that as well as the folks in the gallery that were recognized and the members that presented. Thank you for that. We'll now move on to afternoon afternoon orders. Representative Cameron is recognized for an afternoon orders order. Representative, you have the well. Members, if you'll pay attention this one, I think you want to respond. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First, I want to recognize two pages that have come to work with us today. Stoned out of Phillips in the back. Their mother, or Tori, is my campaign manager. I just want to recognize them. Also, I bring bad news from Walker County, Georgia yesterday. We had three deaths due to fentanyl related overdoses. Fentanyl is killing our people in a record pace. It's awful. It's a scourge on our house. We have a new drug, ISO, which is many, many, many more times powerful than fentanyl. It's time that we dealt with this. Then the drugs coming across the border, those who distribute and those who are selling it to our people. It doesn't discriminate based on age, race, political party. It kills them all. It's non-discriminatory. Thank you. Representative, Representative Romain for an afternoon order. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity. Good morning, y'all, and happy Tuesday. This is going to be a little bit more lighthearted, but 10 years ago today, my husband and I had gone on our first date. While it may not be a really big deal, it was a story that literally was not going to happen. While he'd deny it, it was pretty obvious at the University of 1,000 people when someone keeps running away from you. I promise he was not that scary. But the beauty of it is we started talking at the perfect time. We actually grew up an hour from each other, but I'd never met before. So here we are today, a whole decade later. Five years married through so many ups and downs from career changes to moving across state lines and back to coming back for our families and running a whole very unexpected political campaign. He's always been by my side. And no matter how much of a whirlwind I am, he's never been faced. And so to my husband, thank you for walking through this life with me and celebrating all that I am, even when I ask you to put on Taylor Swift for the millionth time. I still see sparks fly when you smile, you're the common my storm, and the best things ever happened to me. I love you, and here's to hoping to many more decades together. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. It's a good day. It's a good day. We have lots of good things to celebrate. And I'm sure you'll never have a fight. That he's won. Happy anniversary. That completes our afternoon orders. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions?

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

The House-regulated Industries Committee today in lieu of normal committee meeting will be holding a lottery oversight meeting today at 2 o'clock until and in 506 and as always any members will welcome to come to the Regulated Industries and this might be for the newer members that won't learn about surpluses and we hear a lot of misinformation about different surpluses accounts and money and all and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to see the financial success of the lottery and you'll be more than welcome or ten in. Thank you so much. 5.06 L.O.B. Chairman Hawkins, take your time. Be careful. You'll recognize for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Prior to that meeting, the Committee on Public Health will be meeting in the same room at 1 o'clock and the Committee on Health is also invited to join the last section of their meeting on Dementia, a study on Dementia. We do have it. That completes our announcements. When we do have a birthday today, raise your hand if you have a birthday today. Representative Lehman Franklin, happy birthday. Bring it up, Representative. For what purpose is Representative Bruce Ries? Question. State your question. We have several of us serve on quite a few committees, as you know. Some of the chairs have indicated that if you're not in attendance, if you miss two meetings, they will throw you off the committee. All of these committees are meeting at the same time. It's difficult to be in more than one place at the same time. I would like to see some direction from leadership as to how to handle if you have conflicts. You can't be at all of these meetings. You don't want to get thrown off of them, but you want to know what to do. Thank you, Representative Bruce. Number one, I would say you need to communicate with the chair. Every meeting doesn't have the most urgent business that's dealing with, so communicate with the chair. The committee you can come off of if you miss those meetings is the rules committee. That does not apply to the other committees you're own. You will not be taken off of a committee. Thank you for the question. We do have a group of pages today, so I want the pages in the back that are served with us today to stand and be recognized. Thank you for being here. And if you have a page today, as soon as we adjourn, I would ask you to join your page down in the front and we will take page photos. Chair, now recognize the majority leader for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this house stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, February 1, 2023. From the motion of the majority leader that this house stand adjourned until 10 a.m. Wednesday, February 1, 2023. All those in favor will say aye. Those opposed will say no. It's very clear from this position where I'm in. The eyes have it. This house stands adjourned.
