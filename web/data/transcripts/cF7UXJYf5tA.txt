We'll begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge the allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 4th House District, Representative Carter. Carpenter. Super excited to be here this morning. I know you find it amazing that I actually know a pastor, so it's a big step for me here. This is actually not my pastor. This is the pastor at the local snake handling church down the road. He's a, in all seriousness, he's a great friend of mine. His love for God is primary, but is real close second is his love for Georgia football. I'm pleased to introduce my friend, Pastor Stan Lester. Representative, thank you for that unusual introduction. Thank you, Speaker Austin, Representative Carpenter for this amazing invitation to share with you for a few moments today. Dr. King said the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands in times of challenge and in times of controversy. Today I want to thank you for your leadership. I want to thank you for your willingness to serve, and I want to thank you for your desire to make Georgia a better place. There's no doubt about it, and I think everyone in this room would share, and those are outside that these are very unusual times. They're demanding times. They're challenging times. And challenging times throughout history have always called for one thing, and that's great leadership. There's a moment in Israel's history where Israel was headed toward what Scripture calls a promise land, a land that's a good land. They've overcome a great deal of challenges to get to where they are, and they have one more great challenge to overcome, and that's met at the banks of the Jordan River. And in Joshua chapter 3 records the amazing story about a people of God standing at the banks of a Jordan trying to get across. They need to cross the river, but they also need great leadership to understand how to navigate a very difficult situation. And what transpires for the next few moments is an amazing lesson in leadership. The first thing I would see is this, that God chooses great leaders for challenging moments. The people that led them in that moment was a group of people called the Levitical Priesthood. You're here by election. They were there by the appointment of God. They didn't sign up. They didn't choose. They were born for the moment. I guess you could argue that many of you, if not most of you, if not all of you, were born for this moment. Proverbs 16-9 says, a man plans his ways, but God directs his steps. No matter how we think we navigated the process and the path to get where we are, the reality is that God leads us. The second thing you see in terms of leadership is challenging moments to man courageous leadership. These priests thought it was going to be like the first time they came to a big sea called the Red Sea. On that particular occasion, one person stood up, raised a stick, and the water is parted. This was different. On this particular occasion, these Levitical Priesthood had to go into the water and just stand there and wait. It took courage. Joshua 3-3 says this, when you see the Levitical Priest carrying the ark of the covenant, and the larger God moved out before the position and followed them. And here's the interesting part of the story, because you've never been this way before. I don't know if you have felt that way over the last few days and weeks and months, that we've never been this way before. They're unusual times. They demand unusual leadership. It took great courage to be the first to wait into that to the Jordan, to be the first to do the right thing, to be the first to step out. In many ways, they function in the same manner that you do. You're often the first to lead. It takes courage to do that. The third lesson in leadership, I would see is this, great leadership creates a better tomorrow. My favorite part of the passage is in Joshua 3-5, where the scripture says, consecrate yourself for tomorrow. I'm going to do great things among you. Here's what I would tell you. Keep doing the right thing and good things happen. It often takes time to see the fruit of a decision, the fruit of a piece of legislation. Keep stepping in and know that while you're stepping in, good things are happening upstream. Sometimes we get weary and sometimes we get tired. The great apostle Paul said it this way, he said, don't grow tired doing the right thing because in due time you'll be rewarded. Don't get tired doing what you know is right, even though you meet resistance, even though you have frustration. Keep digging in. Don't get tired accepting your assignment and doing what I believe the Lord has called you to do. Several years ago, my last child, Emma, I have four children, my last one, Emma, was about in the first grade. Every time she would go to bed, she didn't want to go to bed and she would want to stay up late so she would try to get me to do things to keep her up late. On this particular night, I was sitting in a chair and Emma looked at me and said, Dad, can we pray? I said, Emma, go to bed. I knew what she was doing. She was trying to manipulate me and as a father, I was not going to be manipulated. I looked at her and I said, Emma, go to bed. She said, Dad, I just want to pray. I said, Emma, go to bed. She said, Dad, please, please pray with me. I pulled her close to me. I said, Lord, keep Emma safe tonight as she goes to bed in Jesus' name. My little first grader, she walked away, shook her head and while she was shaking her head, walking away, not even looking at me said, worst prayer I've ever heard in my life. She got to the edge of the stairs. She took a step up the stairs. She leaned her head back around the wall and looked at me and she said, and you call yourself a preacher. Joshua 315 says this, now the Jordan was at flood stage, the time of harvest and as soon as the priest who carried the ark reached their feet into the Jordan, here's what happened. The Jordan stopped flowing upstream. It didn't stop flowing where they were. It stopped flowing upstream. In other words, they didn't see the fruit of their effort immediately. It took time. I want to encourage you. I want to commend you and as a pastor in this state, I want to thank you for your leadership and all that you've done to make this a great place. Would you pray with me and stand, please? We assemble today as grateful citizens of a state that we're proud to call home. As humble people with faith, we sincerely confess in God we trust. We recognize today that as people created in God's image, we're blessed to have life and the beautiful freedom not so much to do whatever we want, but to do what we ought. Your Father, and you've taught us that in you were one, your log giver, and you've taught all those that will learn and listen the power of truth. You're a Savior that reminds us each and every day that we're only at our best when we're subject to your will and to your heart. For these distinguished legislators, we ask for godly wisdom. We ask for their hearts to be sensitive to the needs of others. We ask for a spirit of unity today that is committed to working to the common good of all peoples. When you call us on an assignment, you always supply us with the grace to accomplish it. May we all determine here today that you alone are credited with the honor of all that we are blessed to accomplish in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. We pledge. We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic, which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. And I do call you past. Let's get a picture. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the committee on information and audits. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Smiley Thomas AM Thomas E. Work Kaiser Wilkerson Yurda and the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bills on the local calendar. The eyes are 145 the nasors zero. These bills having received the requisite constitutional majority are therefore passed. All right we're going on now to morning orders. Morning orders. Ten minutes total. Ten minutes total. Chair recognizes the majority leader of this house for a morning order. Thank you miss speaker. This may be the most important time I've ever been to this well. On June 26th 1976 I married the love of my life. Barbara Dale Winkoff. Dale and I met at Georgia Southern a few years before that. She was my homecoming queen and my sweetheart of Sigma Chi. We've made a life together. She's made me a much better person. No doubt much more to than I am. We've raised up to wonderful young men. And they enrich my life with two beautiful daughter-in-laws and five wonderful grandchildren. Many of you in this room know Dale. She's continued her passion as an educator and as an elementary school principal by working and being with young people at the page desk over the last few years. That has been her passion in her life to work with young people. And it's certainly she has certainly enhanced many of those children's lives. There's no doubt that on this day on our 44th anniversary I certainly continue to be the luckiest man in the world. Thank you miss speaker. Thank you colleagues. And may I add pretty smart to do that today. Chair recognizes Chairman Warkhizer for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I actually had a very different morning order to present this morning. But Evans County lost one of its favorite heroes and best public servants. Felt and Bruton who knew died. And if I'd have said Felt and Bruton in Evans County I'd probably got a lot of blank stairs because he was only known as Duck. Because of this infectious laugh that sounded like a duck when he laughed. But Duck served for three decades in the Evans County Sheriff's Department. In fact he was on the ballot and had he won in November. He would have become the first black sheriff in Evans County. When the outgoing sheriff was asked yesterday the retiring sheriff to say something about Duck. The first thing that came to his mind he said, Duck knew about community policing before it became a buzzword. And everyone knew him. Black, white and everybody. And when there was a situation that was escalating they knew they could always call him and he could calm that person down. Amazingly he was also known for four decades of being at the direct department where he coached hundreds and probably thousands of kids in every sport imaginable. So not in addition to that he also owned a small business. So Deputy Sheriff, Small Business, Recreation Department. An amazing thing is he died of kidney failure. And if any of you have ever watched a family member or friends go through this I watched my mom go through this her last year of her life. And basically two days a year I mean two days a week you go in the hour you leave is your best hour. And as your body continues to build up toxins you wait for your next treatment. So think about that was his life for many many weeks and years. And serving as a deputy sheriff running as a candidate serving at the direct department and run a small business. No one want to blame to him to take a break but that was not him. So if you would join me in a moment of silence for Felton Duck Britain. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I recognize his chairman Beverly for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Big I'll be very brief. Representative Dexter Sharper is a modern day hero. If you have a chance I'm not going to get into the details but if you could Google Representative Dexter Sharper and what he did. And I know Dexter don't want me to do this but he literally stepped into harm's way about a year ago. When a peace officer was trying to arrest a young African American man and drew down on him Dexter stepped in. And it was something that was so heroic I couldn't believe it when I saw it but I wanted to say the Dexter shout out to you man. You're a good genuine hero. And we appreciate you but if you all get a chance to take a look at it it's controversial but I'm telling you you'll have a different respect for that young man. Thank you Dexter Sharper. I'm Senator Southerr Southerr. Chair recognizes Representative Vernon Jones for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of this chamber. I spoke earlier this week and I mentioned the fact that only love can conquer hate. I talked and think the police talked about and think the police on this campus. Those men and women protect us each and every day. I was disturbed by a Facebook post about one of our house members. Directed at our police. Those who are here, black and white who protect us each and every day coming in our facility. That post read clearly the Capitol pays the police to sit around outside the house chamber when we vote on HB838 which has been overnight. Stripped to protect those who kill us. Shame has tag shame has tag. Claim at the Capitol has tags stop killing us. Hashtag justice has tag we are done dying has tag justice has tag Rashad Brooks. I am still like many of you morning Rashad Brooks. But to use his name for these political purposes is just flat out wrong. Although that person has their right to their freedom of expression which I talked about in the hate bill. I disagree with her and I do think that that house member owes those men and women who come here each and every day who work hard for us. An apology. When the Democratic Party came out and said I need to resign, I was an embarrassment because of my choice in terms of who I wanted to support in this presidential campaign. The chair of our party put out a press release all the members who felt the same way. No, I was under attack. But not a single peep from the Democratic Party on this issue. Not a single peep from that person who put that press conference press release out condemning me for my personal choice. Not a single one of you. And Mr. Speaker I think is wrong what she did. And Mr. Speaker and the members of this house. I forgive her. I hope you forgive her. But since she hasn't apologized, I will apologize to the colonel and each and every one of those who are working here at this Capitol. I've had a command of police department. I've had to deal with police shootings. And I've had to go to those mothers and those young spouses when that man or that woman was lost in the line of duty. I've seen the tears I felt the pain. I've washed their bodies, be lured into the ground. What is it we've gotten to the place now we don't even like our police officers? What kind of place will we have? This is not anarchy. Try Dowling now one one and see who you want to come to your rescue. Thank you, members of this house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Kinnerd for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm excited that HB426 will be signed into law today. That's a victory lap for us. It's an order. The hate crimes bill makes a very important statement. But in reality, the real work is still ahead of us because 426 does nothing appreciable to address the racial construct of the white supremacist institution in our state and country. White supremacy, really? White supremacy? Yes. Jesus said that you know a tree by its fruit. I know that's an apple tree because I see the red delicious fruit on the limb. When you look on the limbs of the trees of the U.S. and Georgia, you see the fruit, the results, the outcomes, and the outcomes are disparate across every sector of our way of life, white people and white families succeed more far and above everyone else. Economically, white median household wealth is 10 times the wealth of black households. Home ownership rates for blacks is 43% compared to 72% for whites. Just yesterday it was reported that the wage gap between black men and white men is as large as it was in 1950. Health outcomes. Compared to whites, blacks live shorter lives and live fewer years free of illness. The infant mortality rate is more than double for black infants and whites. Education. 54% of African Americans graduate from high school compared to more than 75% of white students. Black students and grades K through 12 are nearly two and a half times more likely to be suspended from school as their white counterparts. Criminal justice. There are so many stats here, but let's focus on one. In Georgia, African Americans represent 30% of our general population but 61% of our prison population. You know a tree by its fruit and what we did undeniably have is a white supremacist power structure that is designed and supported by political power. It's at the level of policy and legislation that structural change has to be made. Dr. King said true compassion is more than flinging a coin at a beggar, but it comes to understand that an edifice that creates beggars needs restructuring. So for HB426 I say congratulations, but I look forward to the deeper and more substantial work of justice. I look forward to building with you a truly equitable Georgia in future sessions. We can't live and we can't, like in times past, just simply move on from this crisis moment and go back to the same old same old. We must see change. And representative Cannon, we love you and support you. Thank you and I yield the will. We're going on now to the rules calendar, the 10 minutes for morning orders having expired. Going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 336. Senate Bill 336 by Senator Gooch, the 51st, doogan to the 30th Thomas, the Thompson to the 14th Bill of the 49th, Kennedy the 18th and others. To be entitled to act to amend Article 3 of Chapter 2, a total 40 that fiscal go to Georgia, annotated relating to prestige license plates, special plates for certain persons and vehicles. So to expand eligibility for certain members of the military. This bill I'm going to refer to the committee. A motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I'll bring today a bill about specialty license plates in the two of them here and they run the gamut from one end of the spectrum to the other. Senator Gooch introduced the bill. He's from DeLonica, where at North Georgia college, the military college, the Georgia is. And with the US Army Rangers, train their mountaineering skills. He introduced one to get a specialty license plate for anyone who's ever served in US Army Rangers or graduated from the US Army Ranger School. In addition, many of you know that the general lady from Smirna had a bill that introduced the option to have a tennis license plate. It was a viscer rated over in the Senate and it was amended to be put back in here. So all this bill does is provide for two specialty license plates, one for US Army Rangers and one for tennis-officing not-os. I'll be glad to take any questions if not yield well. I do not see any questions. Gentlemen, as you'll do the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee and rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll. Jones J.

Senate Bill 289, Senator Mulles, 53rd to be titled, NAC to amend Chapter 5 and 48 to be called to the Georgia annotator, adding the law of taxation and property. So, as to remove the requirement that mobile homes procure permits and procure and display decals, this bill having referred to committee, and the committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Chairman of the House, the bill you have before you now, is not what it started out to be when the Senate sent it to us, but we're using it as a vehicle to send back to them something that shock of shock they failed to move on, but we sent it to them with close to a unanimous vote. It's simply a legal bill which says when the legislature passes a tax law that the tax tribunal, the quarter-nice state that deals with tax issues, will give deference to the legislative interpretation rather than the Department of Revenue. It's a wise bill. It says that we're the ones that set spolicy in this state, and you have to follow the law. I don't think five people hardly voted against it last time we sent it to them, and we're simply going to send it back to them again. In this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I'll be happy to answer any questions. You do not appear to have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Shall this bill now pass? I'm sorry.

Senate Bill 308 by Senate of the Capatric of the 32nd Alvers, 56th Robertson of the 29th Harper of the 7th, say of the 34th. To be entitled to a men article 3 of Chapter 7 on Title 52, the official go to Georgia annotator related abandoned vessels, so as to remove certain redundant processes regarding unattended vessels in public waters. This bill had referred to the committee of public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Bill Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Ms. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. This bill, Senate Bill 308 is very simple and it's very rational. What it does is in terms of abandoned vehicles and public waterways in this state, it requires that both the Department of Natural Resources and the GBI do investigations and do remedial work. All this bill does is eliminate the GBI and duplication of services so they can better utilize their time doing other things. And I'll stand for any questions if they are none. I'll amen in the well.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 402. Senate Bill 402. Senate Bill 402 by Senator Robertson. 29th Albers of 56 Miller to 49th, Unerman to 45th, Paine from 54th and others. Be a title of NAC to amend Article 16, Title 17, Part 3 of Article 6 of Chapter 11 of Title 15, Chapter 10 of Title 16, Article 4 of Chapter 3 of Title 42. In Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 52, the official quoted Georgia annotated relating to general provisions regarding bonds and court purposes. This bill haven't referred to the committee. Judiciary, non-civil committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to present the bill. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Today I bring to you Senate Bill 402. And Senate Bill 402 does one simple thing. He shines some light on the problem that we have in our criminal justice system. Ladies and gentlemen, anybody who gets in trouble and gets arrested has a right to a bond hearing. A right to get out of jail on bond and what the judge does, he evaluates the seriousness of the crime. He evaluates whether or not the person in front of them is a flight risk. And then he sets a reasonable bond. You all understand that you've heard it before. And for a long time in this state has been a particular kind of bond. We call it a signature bond where the judge actually does not make the arrested person put any skin in the game. In other words, they don't put up any money. They don't put up any property for a bond because the judge decides that they're not a flight risk. They're going to come back. Well, as you all know, the reason we come down here and meet every year is that we try to solve problems that are created with the legal system that we have. And right now a significant problem has arisen only in a few jurisdictions. But some judges are letting people go on signature bonds without giving it enough of a thought. And we're creating a revolving door. They get arrested. Don't choose to break it into someone's house. The judges let him out for nothing on Wednesday. And then they commit another crime on Thursday. Now, when this problem was brought to us, the decision was or the request was, let's just do away completely with the judge's ability to give a bond without requiring some property or some money behind it. And I said, no, that's not a good idea. And here's why judges have always had that discretion. And we need to leave that discretion with them. My judges where I'm from don't do this. Probably the chances are the judges where you're from don't misuse this either. So we don't need to punish the good judges for what's a few handful or misusing. So what we did instead, we just simply changed the name of a signature bond. When you get out on the signature bond right now, the judge can set it for $50,000. That looks like a lot of money. But you know what? It's not backed up by anything. And the judge is just hoping you show back up. We changed it from a signature bond to something called an unsecured judicial release. And that's what that bill does in front of you. It changes the word to an unsecured judicial release. Now why does that going to help solve the problem? Because now when you go look at a judge who let somebody out that recommitted a crime just after that, it's not going to look like he gave him a $50,000 bond when he really didn't. It's going to have the word unsecured judicial release. Rather than taking away the authority, we are simply shining light on a problem and letting it be aired out a little bit. And if they do that, they can own up to it. That's what this bill does. It is a wise, modest measure to attempt to address an area where we have a problem and I would appreciate your support and I'll be happy to answer any questions. Do you yield for questions? Absolutely, Ms. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Al Williams for a question to your left. Yes, sir. Our question is, in this state, with people being able to sign off on bonds, the size you're referring to, do we have any accounting of how many of these bonds are for $50,000? I think your question probably is going to this. How bad is this problem? How often is it happening? In the last year, a third of the people arrested that were given the signature of bonds in Fulton County did not show back up for court. And what makes happen is that the officers who need to be protecting the houses that are getting broken into now have to go out there and find folks that had no skin in the game and decided not to come back to court. Absolutely. Are you indicating that the problem only rests in Fulton County? No, there's another count out there too, named Clark. And it's happening in a few other places, but those are the worst offenders. You further, you? Yes, sir, Ms. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Welch for your left for a question. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dillman, you yield. Absolutely. This is a transparency bill, that's right. Sunshine. Yes. What does is direct the public's attention to what appears to be a financial bond when it's a signature bond. That is correct. But it truly is not. Is that not true? That is absolutely correct. I do not see any other questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to yield the well. And my guess is, somebody is going to follow me and tell you that this is not a good bill. When they do, I'm going to come right behind that person and explain to you again what it is. Thank you, and I would ask you a favourable consideration. You are a visionary. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When I was sitting in my seat, I was struggling to find the words for how I was going to introduce it. And the previous speaker, he set me up for that. This is not a good bill. Let me just say one thing. I mean, if this was as simple as changing the language of own recognizance to an unsecured judicial release, this bill would be a lot shorter. And if that was a solution to a problem that existed, just changing the name of something, we all know that wouldn't work. We're just going to call it something different. I mean, calling something different doesn't fix anything. But the core of this bill does a lot more than that. You know, it is about judicial discretion. And if you look at lines 64 through 67, you can see the strike where it's removing the discretion of judges to enter in order to the contrary if they make a determination in those bill restricted offenses, whether they should be released on their own recognizance. But I really fundamentally, when I was a young lawyer, one of my mentors at the law firm that I was working for, he used to be a young protégé of a lawyer, of great esteem in Georgia named Charlie Kerbo. Charlie Kerbo taught my mentor that every case had a moral and that the effective way to communicate what a case was really all about was to find the moral of that case and convey that to the jury. You know what the moral of this case is about money? This bill is about money. It's about who makes it when this bill becomes law. Now I want to talk about the, you know, prison conditions. In West Georgia, we are in the unfortunate situation at the moment of going through a COVID spike. Two places are feeling that very intensely. One is a nursing home and the other is the Troop County Jail. It's overcrowded. There are not enough beds already in there. There are people sleeping in little cots and in some cases an air mattress on the floor in the midst of a COVID outbreak. And it's hard not to think about that issue in the context of this bill because the reality is that a bill like this actually makes handling a situation like that more difficult. I'll be followed by a speaker who will tell you it's a good bill. Might be a speaker in between us that also tells you that it's a bad bill. Let's not monetize the criminal justice system. Let's not make it about money. Final thing and then I'm going to sit down. You know, in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty. And when someone is incarcerated, the whole principle of bail is that before your trial, you can get out so that you can prepare for your defense among other things. Because if you think that a defendant who is incarcerated has the same ability to prepare a defense for his or her liberty, then someone who is out of jail and out of custody, you are sadly mistaken. It's not the same thing. Money. Money is often the root of a lot of bad bills. And this one's sprouted right up from the base. Mr. Speaker, how you'll do well. You have questions if you care to you. It's up to you. I'll you, Mr. Speaker. You yield for questions. I will. Chair recognizes representative Wynn in the gallery to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the chair, does the leader yield? I will. How does this bill impact those who are being charged with misdemeanors? So I think that there will be a speaker who will talk about the impact on municipal court judges. This bill muddies the water with respect to the process that there is now. Just the leader further yield. I do. Isn't it true that this bill is being supported by bail fund industry and being opposed by the council on municipal court judges? I believe that to be true. Thank you. Do you further yield? I will. Chair recognizes representative dryer to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Leader, do you yield? I do. Isn't it true that this body believes in local control and looking to local folks for wisdom on how to govern their affairs? I believe that. I hope that to be true. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Isn't it true that I chair the Fulton House delegation? And I am adamantly opposed to this, along with most of the members of that delegation? I believe that to be true. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I would just. I would just say one more thing before I yield. I trust our judges. And you know, they're called judges for a reason because they judge. That's the action they take. And no circumstances are the same. And when we try to use sledgehammers like this to make people rich, we make a serious, serious mistake as a deliberative body. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, you wish the chairman's time. Chairman Fleming has recognized for the chairman's time, which under the rules of this house is limited to 20 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I won't take the 20 minutes. Because what I'm about to tell you is simple and where the heart of this bill goes to, this bill does not take one eye-oder of authority away from judges to give a bond if they think it's appropriate. They can let them out for free, basically, without putting up any property or any money. So what they have to do is own up to it and they have to allow you to look in the records after it's happened. And it will not be referred to as a $50,000 bond. And it looks like they put up a bond. It will be referred to as an unsecured judicial release. The best way for us to solve problems down here is to make a modest adjustment shine light on the situation in that the public decide next time that judge stands for election, whether or not he has done a good job or not. That's the way democracy works and that's what this bill helps happen. Now I'm going to tell you why this is not about the money. It was tempting to me to come down here to you and read you horrible cases of what people have done when they get out of jail and they come back. I didn't want to have to do that because I don't want to drag names into this. I don't want family members to have to hear about some terrible things that have happened again. But I'm going to give you one case what this is about. A man charged with rape and sexual attack on a woman in 2018 was let out on a signature bond. Guess what? He didn't come back to court. And there is example and example and example again of people doing horrible things to other people and a judge letting them go for nothing. And you know what? After you pass this bill, which I hope you will, they can still do that. It's just that they're going to have to own up to it when it happens because you're going to be able to know what they did in plain English language. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your favor of consideration of this bill. I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is known. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll. But before doing that, what purpose does Chairman Knight rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, would the chairman, who just, I didn't get a chance to ask him a question, but would it not be true that the chairman was also referring to what was an article that was written last year, I'm sorry, five months ago, that did a report that more than 2,000 felony charges were released from bond last year in Fulton County, including 35 charges of child molestation and 11 charges of enticing a child for...

Would that not be true? If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he believes that to be the truth. What purpose does representative Oliver rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true, sir, that I spend a good number of days and nights in the youth as a magistrate court judge not in both of them but in the cab issuing bonds? And the progress we have made on the low-effects bonds, misdemeanor bonds, particularly around domestic violence, condition bonds, provisional bonds, unusual circumstances, individual analysis bonds that is going to be slowed by this bill. Is it that true, sir? If the lady states that, I'm sure she believes that to be true. I am more concerned, isn't it true, Mr. Speaker, with the real implication on the low-offence of offenders and those that for the most part end up at the magistrate courts at night on family disputes, neighbor disputes, disputes that are not related to violent crimes, isn't that true, sir? I'm sure if the lady has stated that, she believes that to be true. What purpose does representative Hawley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that this bill casts dispersions against the judges of this state by judging all the 158 other counties besides just Fulton in placing this new definition of signature bond casting it in a negative light? Well, I'm sure the gentleman must believe that to be true, but I don't read the bill that way since you asked my opinion. Yes, sir, further inquiry. State your inquiry. It's not true that one of the fundamentals of this nation and this establishment was for people to be able to leave a system by which they paid for their freedom, being of early Americans having to be dead or stately. The fact that we are literally now as an independent nation, but we're not placing the poor in contempt simply because they cannot afford to get out of jail. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. Okay. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? No vote aye, those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll.

Clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 381, the eyes are 165, the nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 393.

Senate Bill 393 to be titled an act to amend part two of Article two, Chapter three, a title 20, and Chapter three, a title 35, the official to Georgia annotated relating the university system and the Georgia Bureau of investigation respectively. So as to revise the duties and powers of certain law enforcement officers and agencies, this bill I've referred to the committee on public safety and Homeland Security that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative reused to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this is a very simple bill. This is at the request of the Georgia Bureau of investigation. Currently they have three lawyers on staff and those lawyers travel across the state and assist other jurisdictions, typically smaller jurisdictions that do not have the adequate resources or expertise on some of these kinds of laws. And some of these complicated matters like child sex trafficking, things like that. What this bill does is that upon the request of the prosecutor, it would allow the GBI to instead of just assist, it would allow them to actually be sworn in on case by case basis and essentially help prosecute the case for those jurisdictions. Does it create any new positions? That's a matter of appropriations. This just simply allows the lawyers on their staff to be able to go a little bit further further than assisting in an investigation or assisting in a case, but actually be sworn in. I'll be happy to take any questions. Do you feel for questions? Chair recognizes Chairman Welch to your left for a question. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I do. What is the difference between the attorneys that the prosecuting attorneys counsel already provides to write DA assistance and special counsel litigate on obligation, but in prosecutions? What's the difference between those existing attorneys and the addition of these three or the use of these three in the prosecution of cases from the GBI? It would just be essentially allowing the GBI the same ability to assist like prosecuting attorneys counsel can. Since the GBI has some narrow focuses, there are some issues where they are tremendous experts in and potentially have more expertise than even other than prosecuting attorney counsel's resources may have. It just creates a synergy there. Chair recognizes Representative Al Williams to your left for a question. I do. I appreciate you not bringing the big book back today. I haven't done your homework. I did this for you. I did not do that for you. Lord, forgive him this time. I've been telling people for years that you can bring the power out. Now I'm really nervous. I believe the gentleman will yield again. Yeah, I will. Thank you, kind of. I appreciate you. I want to follow through a question for you. Isn't that so that what the chairman of the Prophetsians committee of some committee have said through at the point that we died real deep in the budget? And we reviewed the request of the GBI very, very closely in these times that we're cutting. That's you this time. I think every time we mention budget, we have a little trouble. Whoever that is whispering in this thing. Wow. I forgot my question. Good. Mr. Speaker. Let's take a thought. Just go to that. On that, I will yield this well. I've never seen anybody leave the well that quick before. I'm sorry. No gentleman has yielded the well. Representative Bowdie, you want to get up here and talk? Chair recognizes representative Bowdie to speak to the bill. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be very short because of our technical difficulties right now. First of all, I'd like to say that this speech that I'm going to give today, which is really not a speech, is going to be very short in regards to SB 393. It's not an anti law enforcement nor anti-GBI speech. This is just a simple speech about separation and keeping duty separate. Law enforcement investigators and prosecutors traditionally have separate duties. Law enforcement officers investigate and gather evidence. Prosecuse way the evidence that they gather. And the law in the law and prosecute those cases. This bill would potentially mother the waters because investigators would also be at the right prosecutors. And so this bill attempts to give three GBI lawyers in their legal division, the opportunity, I guess, in the right, to also prosecute cases. That will always be like your local law enforcement or sheriff's office also having prosecutors in their office prosecuting cases. So not only you're going to be investigating the case, you're also going to be prosecuting the case. And so I would say that's potentially a conflict of interest. Now I'm going to read you directly from the GBI whole page on their website, exactly the duties and vision statement of our GBI. It says welcome to the GBI. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, GBI, is an independent, remember, independent state agency that supports, supports the state's criminal justice system in areas of criminal investigation, for visit, laboratory services, and computerized criminal justice information. The key words, two key words, independent and supports. If we allow this bill to pass today, the GBI would no longer be just supporting and being independent, they will be a part of the case itself. Because at that point in time, they will be involved in investigation, potentially. So they will also be involved with testifying that trial, potentially. And they also will be involved in the day-to-day of that investigation. We have to keep both entities separate. The police force and GBI will collect evidence. And at that point in time, they will turn the evidence over to the DA to prosecute the case. It's just that simple. It's how we always done it. If you're going to have anyone that wants to be involved with taking over a case or assisting, we have what we call the Attorney General's Office. And they should be brought in because they're the law division of this state. And they need to have any other assistance for anyone. The Attorney General has that constitutional duty to do that. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm asking every member in this House to vote no to this bill. And I will yield for questions at this time. Do you have a question? Yes. Chair recognizes Representative Reeves to your left for a question. Yes, Mr. Speaker, just gentlemen yield. Yes, I do. Representative Bowdie, are you familiar with how the FBI operates and how they have operated for a very long time in that they have special investigators working directly with prosecutors side by side throughout the life of the case. And further, are you familiar with the current powers of any district attorney in this state to issue no arrest bench warrants? And that, as we just said, as I brought up a couple of days ago, I didn't think I'd get two chances to do this. What Paul Howard has currently done in Fulton County on the recent case here is exactly what you're arguing he should not be able to do. Aren't those things true? Well, I can't speak for the district attorney of Fulton County. And I can't speak for the FBI. But in the state of Georgia, traditionally, we have had a separation of both. And we need to continue to have that Mr. Representative. I'm not disputing what's happening in other areas as far as the federal government. But traditionally, as high as been done in the state of Georgia, we have the DA's office that prosecute cases. And we have law enforcement officers who investigate cases. It's just really that simple, Mr. Representative. Are you not familiar with the process and district attorneys of power they have called the no arrest bench warrants process? Are you not familiar with that? Well, I am familiar with it. And at that, when you speak of that, Mr. Representative, it still is the decision and discretion of the DA, even in itching those wars and not issuing those wars. And I know in this particular case, a lot of people may have a heartburn about DA Howard and how he proceeded with the case. And I'm not here to argue the validity of that because I'm not DA, Paul Howard. But I'm here just to state the facts of what we have currently in law today on how we prosecute cases and how cases are investigated. And I have not heard a good reason for not allowing the AG to take on these duties if these local law enforcement agencies and DA's office need supplemental assistance. Do you feel for one more question? Yes. Mr. Representative. Is it not true that I've been down here six years and I've never heard anybody in this body or the body across the hall talk about the need to remove the district attorney's ability to issue no arrest bench warrants and commit cases. Is it that true? Well, I would say, Mr. Rubbs, I don't know if you have had that opportunity here or not here that, but I would say this, that this bill did not go through the Committee of Judicial Nights Civil. So I would say that I did not get the opportunity to vet this bill because I would have brought all these casers up during the Committee hearing. No further questions. Would that Mr. Begum? No, sorry, you do have a question. Would that Mr. Begum, I'm going to hear the well at this time. Did you yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is not in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the Committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 393 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll. Alexander Hanoloowitz, Far, Barton, Belton, Bennett, Bentley, Benton, Beverly, Blackman, Bodie, Bruce.

On the passage of Senate Bill 393, the eyes are 99, the seats are 69, this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes representative Reeves for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 912. Representative Reeves has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 912, the Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 912 to be entitled to amend chapter 5 or Title 49 in the fiscal to Georgia and Tadya, relating the programs and protections for youth and children so as authorized foster parents to arrange for short term babysitting. Chair recognizes representative Reeves to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello again, everybody. And I'm pretty sure that this bill is not going to have anything to do with Paul Howard. So this is a defects foster care bill. House Bill 912 originally passed the House unanimously, which is the babysitter bill that allows for foster parents some flexibility in short term care for foster parents. And in the process, this bill has in order to consolidate some measures that are related to make our session more efficient. We've consolidated some of the defects bills. And so this bill now holds Senate Bill 335, which is a bill that creates some efficiencies in our defects and foster care system. It codifies and existing rules and reg that allow defects, the ability to set training hours based on the experience of the foster care parent or the respite volunteer. And it also, significantly, it adds in an attorney conflict provision. One of the biggest problems in parental termination hearings is that everybody is ready and good to go and everybody's in court. But because of the way the conflict proceedings go, the attorney that one of the attorneys is end up stuck in a courtroom in some other county on a different case and is just sitting there but cannot go and attend the hearing that is waiting on him or her. And a lot of times what that means is everybody is ready and good to go. And then the hearing has to end up getting rescheduled because of the way attorney conflicts work. And this will prioritize defects cases which will create a tremendous efficiency and is going to benefit everybody in the system. I'll be happy to yield for questions, Mr. Speaker. I do not see any questions. You'll well. Thank you. I'm sorry. You do have a question. I'll yield. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson in the gallery. Does the gentleman you? I do. Is the bill that requires or lowers the requirement for foster parent training hours? No, it's not. It codifies what is already in rules and regs which in rules and regulations right now defects is allowed to set the hours of training. So this just simply puts it in code. And as we discuss, I know this issue was raised in committee. And as we discussed, a foster parent or a respite worker has access in the ability to obtain as much training as they want. One of the things that we have experienced in that director Rawlings is advocating for this change particularly with respite workers is that no matter how many years they've been doing it, they're required by the rules and regs right now to do 15 hours and they want the goal is to reduce that if a person is well experienced and as they're doing, they don't need to take a whole weekend and do that. So that is going to be a change that's going to be made and this simply looks to codify it, but it does actually reduce anything. It just moves over the rules and regs into code. So can I go back to what you just said? The goal is to reduce foster parent training hours? No, actually I did not. I'm going to clarify what I said. Obviously the goal of this state and the goal of defects is for every foster parent and respite worker and any volunteer worker within the defects system to be adequately trained. So the goal is not to categorically reduce all training, but we are seeing, when I say turnover, I mean certain folks involved in the program that have been involved for a long time decide that they're not going to do it anymore because of some of the requirements that they have to go through. And that is a tragedy and that is something that we can't lose good people because we make them sit through 15 hours of training to be a respite worker when they've been doing it for years. And so if defects discretion, if they want to reduce that number, then I believe we need to equip with them with the ability to do what they think is best to do in order to retain the workers and the volunteers and the helpers. We need more people doing these services. And if working with that will help that, then I think that that's the greater good here. I do. Is it not true that I am a licensed social worker for the past 20 plus years? I believe that is true. Is there any, by the state, to reduce my required hours every year of training because I have 20 years of experience? Is there any effort to do what? Say that again. So reduce the amount of hours required for licensed individuals who have 20, 30, 40 plus years of experience. I don't know about as far as social workers go. I don't know the answer to that question, but if you feel that that is something that is appropriate, then I think that it would be this is this is the building to discuss that and to look at that issue and see if that would be appropriate moving forward. Do you further heal? I do. One more time. So I am required to do 30 hours of ongoing education every two years to require to keep my license. And with foster parents who take care of our most vulnerable, I am very concerned at any effort to reduce the amount of foster parent trainings because it's not me on the news when a child dies. I understand your position, but I will say that if we're going to improve our foster care system and if we're going to try to rebuild what is in some ways a broke down machine, we have to stop legislating to the point 1%. And we have got to build our foster care system around the 99.9%. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I will yield the well. On the gentleman's motion at this house agree to the Senate substitute house bill 912. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll. What purpose does representative Kelly rise? Stature inquiry. I believe that to be true. State it your inquiry. The gentleman makes a good point. Mr. Representative Hutchinson rise. Parliamentary interstature inquiry. Is it not true in the state of Georgia that we are lacking in social workers and mental health professionals in Georgia? If the lady so states, I'm sure she believes that to be true. All right, clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll. We're voting on the motion.

The nays are 31 and this house has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 912. Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we disagree to the amendment by the Senate on House Bill 914. When Heath Clark has moved that this house disagree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 914, the clerk will read the caption. House Bill 914 to be titled an act to amend Title 43, the Fisher go to Georgia, Annotated Relating Professions and Businesses to provide for military spouses licensed in other states to practice certain professions and occupations to obtain a license by endorsement to practice in this state. Chair recognizes Chairman Clark to explain his motion. Members, in the yesterday at the last minute in the Senate, a senator added an amendment to this bill without talking to me or the Senate sponsor of the bill, we believe that it's not germane to the bill. We're dealing with professional licenses for military spouses and the amendment was dealing with crematory practices. So we're moving to disagree and send it back to the Senate. So that's the motion. On the gentleman's motion that the House disagree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 914, is there any objection? Is there objection that Chair hears none in this house has disagreed? Chair recognizes on a point of personal privilege the chairman of the House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee, Chairman Tom McCall. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know Ron asked me yesterday if it was my last time in the well and I thought it might have been, but then the boss had other things in mind. I thought my last session was never going in. I didn't know if it was called y'all didn't want me to leave or didn't want to get rid of me or what, but anyway I'm glad to be back with y'all that I call friends. There's so many people that all of us need to think and I don't want to believe at a point because I know that I'm taking up time for dinner, but I am going to talk this for a second. The number one person that I need to thank is my wife Jane Shea. She almost sang a land of the race three kids and kept the animals on the right side of the fence. While I was off up here and all over the state doing stuff and then I only had five years old and Katie was about six months old when I got a leg. They have never known any other life than what this is. And there's bicester, Rachel and Bristol, but the best thing dealing with youngers is having grandjongers. And when it will, I love you, babies. And then most of you don't know our oldest son named Bud. Bud was confined to a wheelchair and we brought him up here and he had pictures made with different governors and a lot of the speakers and I appreciate everybody that took time to treat Bud just like he was a normal kid, which in my eyes he was. He just nobody can tell me what normal is. But the people back home that let me do this for 26 years, all of y'all that is now and has been on the ad committee. You know, we don't know, try to be the most non-partisan committee as far as arguing goes because what we talk about each and every citizen in the state of Georgia has to have and that's something to eat and something to wear and somewhere to live. And then all of y'all members that are here today and has been, I just appreciate you letting me be your friend. And helping us take care of our ag and in the future when an ag issue comes up, I want you to remember WWTD, what would Tom do? So y'all keep on taking care of what the biggest industry in the state and if folks out in the hall first off, I want to thank the troopers and the Capitol police for looking after us and taking care of us and protecting us all of these years that they have been doing that. And you know the lobbyist out there, I'm not going to try to name them all, but y'all are lifelong friends and special friends to my family. Especially that bunch it calls down in 228 that second home and hangs around down there. And I hope most of y'all won't be saying well we glad that guy's gone. But I want to tell you another little story about the custodians. If you're not nice to the people that come by and pick up your trash then there's something wrong with you. Pick your trash basket up, hand it out to them so they don't have to come behind you to get it. And they used to be old guy named John and everybody just thought John was the gentleman. Well he come to my office and we give him peanuts and co-colors and we call him internet because he knew more about what was going on in this place because while he was pushing the broom and picking up trash he was listening to everybody talking. And we were nice to him down there and he would tell us what was going on. He probably knew more than what to speak or do. And over the 26th year I have had as y'all do fantastic administrative assistance. Diana who was up in lead council was my first one. And by the way if y'all hadn't figured out how to deal with lead council as a little girl named Jennifer up there that if you're not friends with her you're going to get nothing out of lead council. So she can handle things when Rick came. Talmad's down in the floor leader's office Pat who John burned stole from me and she had retired and then I have Lee who looks after Tray and me and these people they keep you constituents happy which is a big deal when you come from the country like I do. But I tell you what has become clear to me is that the ladies in this capital kind of run this place. You're a you're Jan Holley. They don't want to take it that keep this house moving like it's supposed to. And when I first came up here we didn't have beepers we didn't have cell phones. There was phones out there and people like Adam Powell smoking cigars kept a fog in that any room out there where you had to go where you had to go use the phone. And then we got a beeper and we thought we were then heaven. But then I'd have to get off a trot and go to high off to the telephone to call my secretary whenever she beat me. And then we got him and she could leave a little message and then you got back phones and then you got cell phones. So that's how long I've been in this probably turned on to go home. I've been through five governors and five speakers and the two that we have rank at the top. Thank you Mr. Speaker for letting me be your head chair. And I've only said in two chairs the whole time I've been here. One of them is right there where Jodie likes it and the other one is where I sit now. And my seat mates, Alan Powell who you know how Alan is. And Jay Roberts was my seat mate and then Terry England who we were friends way before this life. And I like you and send it to Terry. And then Kevin Cook who don't know that if you don't put a gas cap back on the trot that will fill up with trash and stop to cut the engine off. And I got admit to all of y'all my fingerprints aren't the only one that's on my button for voting. Because sometimes if a fence was down or somebody was sick a lot of times especially with mud my seat mates would vote my machines. They knew how I thought so you know you can't you can fire me now I'm just a husband. But I'm just telling you the truth that was. In this place inside this room is like a big family. I have lost both parents both in the old and my oldest son since I've been here. And when you walk up the steps at the church to a funeral and ask some of you, let your lady buddy stand in there that lets you really know. It lets you really know what kind of place they see us. And I'm not going to get all preachy but I try to live by two Bible verses. One of them is Proverbs 22 that says a good name is worth more than riches and gold. And when you farm for eleven and do this for eleven the only thing you got to good name because you ain't going to have no riches and gold. And then the other one is Matthew 6 it basically says do you good deeds and don't try to take credit for it. And it doesn't matter who gets the credit. And I want you to know never ever, ever, never forget where you came from. And I hope I have never done that since I've been here. A way less you want in favor. When you get back home if you know you farm, be real people in your county. Tell them, tell them Jane is real good and I'm kind of half decent but would make a good state farm be real president. I miss y'all, I'm going to miss y'all, I love y'all. Good luck and no vim with all of you that's got to deal with that and I hope I'll see y'all better soon. Thank you. They don't make many like Tom McCall anymore. Chair recognizes Chairman Beverly for an announcement. Thank you, Speaker. The Georgia House Democratic caucus, when you go back to your room, you will have lunch in your room. We will not be having a meeting but there's lunch in your room. We will be adjourned for lunch. And you're in your legislative office. Chair recognizes Chairman Tanner for an announcement. We're going to have a joint transportation meeting during the lunch break. After the meeting lunch will be provided. It's going to be in CLOB 506. If you could come, this is for the purpose of considering the planning director for GDOT and to approve the joint 10-year plan. Thank you. Appears to be all of the announcements. I'm sorry we have, Chair recognizes Representative Bennett for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus meeting immediately upon lunch in German on the South Wing steps for a presentation. Thank you.
