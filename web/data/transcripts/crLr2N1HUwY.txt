TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for coming. I'm John Kennedy and I have the
honor of serving as the president of the Georgia Senate. On November 5th of last year,
the people of Georgia sent the majority caucus a mandate. They told us and told the rest
of you that they wanted competent, consistent, and effective leadership to bring conservative
principles to the Georgia legislature and to continue to make sure that we governed
like that.
I would tell you that in my years of serving in the Georgia Senate, our caucus has never
been more united than we are today.
We have brought forth a conservative agenda, and in a few minutes I'm going to pitch
it to our majority leader, Steve Gooch, who is going to give you some details of some
the legislation that we're going to propose. But I want to thank the members of my caucus
for their hard work, not only during this legislative session, but the work that we've
done before session to decide those priorities that we want it to bring forth, and also
the hard work that they're going to continue to do during the 40 days that we're going
to be working here. For those of you that are not here but are following along at home,
so to speak, if your senator is standing behind me, please know that they are dialed in
and laser focus to make sure that they're doing the good, hard work for you and the work
for Georgians that we need to continue to maintain good, conservative, and common sense
policies.
I want to touch just on three areas before I pitch it to our majority leader.
From Governor Kemp to our Speaker Burns to Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones, they have
We've been clear that we must provide certain things to the people of Georgia.
And three of those are one, we've got to provide relief to the parts of Georgia that have
suffered from Hurricane Helene.
The devastation, if you have not seen it, is significant.
And the communities that have suffered under that hurricane are simply not going to recover
if we don't provide the state resources that we can.
The families that have been devastated by Hurricane Helene have suffered generational losses
and they need help as well.
We're going to do all that we can and we're going to be creative.
I want to thank Governor Kemp for the proposals he has already placed in the budget and the
amended budget to help those folks that desperately need that help.
But the truth is, there are simply communities that are not going to recover if we don't
provide help.
Secondly, we have to balance our civil justice system.
We've got to do that to provide fair access to everyone that needs to go to court, regardless of what side of the V that you're on.
But we also have to make sure that we stabilize the cost of insurance for consumers across Georgia.
And we've also got to make sure that we keep a positive business environment to help those
job creators so that we continue to have a positive business environment.
And third, one of the things you're going to hear us talk a lot about this session.
And the legislation you're going to see come forth from this caucus is going to be protecting
children.
The stories that we've heard around the country of school shootings got visited on us
and our state last fall.
And as a father of two, it's devastating to think about the school environment that was
created that day.
We're going to make sure that we continue to do what we can and be creative so that children
that are going to school know that they're in a safe school environment, that parents
that are dropping their children off at school know they're dropping their children off
at a safe location, and finally to make sure that the administrators and the teachers that
go to work every day to teach our children are doing so in a safe environment.
I want to thank you for being here. I want to tell you that this caucus is going to continue
to work hard and bring common sense legislation forward. And at this point, I want to call
on our majority leader, majority leader Gooch, who's going to give you some details of
the things you're going to hear about as this session continues to unfold between now
and April the 4th.
Thank you, John.
Thank you, Mr. Pro Tem.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
It's my pleasure to be here.
Standing before these fine gentlemen and ladies behind me,
we have been working already for three weeks.
As you all know, this is legislative day 10 out of 40.
So we are well underway and anxious to get to work.
Many of our efforts and our priorities are already in motion.
You've been reading about them in the local and Atlanta news
and around the state.
But today, I want to talk about the agenda
that we've set for our caucus this session.
It's important for our priorities to reflect
those of the citizens who sent us here to do the people's work.
Coming off of a historic election last November,
when Donald J. Trump was elected president again,
president number 47, it should be easy to understand
that the message sent by the folks around Georgia
and across our great nation, their message can be summed up
in one simple word.
and that word is security.
Whether it's economic security by cutting the income tax
or returning billions of dollars of unspent surplus funds,
as we've seen through the leadership of Governor Camp,
and of course the leadership of the House and the Senate,
we continue to look for ways to cut waste,
and we'll continue to look for ways to cut waste
as we go forward in this session and next year as well.
Physical security, which includes stopping violence
and violent crimes from occurring in our state,
in our communities, and back home,
and the flow of drugs and criminals
coming across our borders,
or even what I would consider emotional security,
with a return to societal sanity
by ending the assault on common sense
by the overly weight-woke radical left in our nation.
I don't expect the corporate media,
or even the DC Washington establishment
to get the message that I'm delivering today,
but when two Democrat U.S. senators from Georgia
vote for the Lake and Rally Act just days ago,
at least some folks on the left understand
that they have strayed too far in a fantasy land.
And as a result, neglected the basic needs
of the people that are supposed to serve
every day Americans and right here in Georgia as well.
With that context as our guide,
the Senate majority will spend these 40 legislative days,
focus on issues that enhance security for families,
especially children, security for our neighbors in need
and security for the job creators
who help provide the economic opportunity
that ensures safe, stable, and healthy communities.
From Valdosta to Augusta, Hurricane Helene
cut a path of destruction across our state
like never seen before in our history.
Billions of dollars in losses.
People out of jobs, people out of school,
people with nowhere to sleep, people without water,
no sewer, no access to their community medical providers.
These are things that we think are key and critical
to providing a safe community in a safe state
for our families to live work and play.
As you have heard from Governor Camp,
Lieutenant Governor Jones and Speaker John Burns,
There will be a substantial aid package in our budget this year that will help
Georgians recover from the heartbreaking losses that was due to no fault of their own.
Over the years, Georgia Republicans have conservatively managed our resources and
built surpluses for preparation for days like today.
In addition to our mutual support for disaster aid, our caucus will be exploring potential legislative remedies to help
fellow Georgians who are hurting. Senator Russ Goodman, who stands behind me today,
is examining ways to temporarily relieve the heavy tax burden on the timber owners in
South Georgia, whose family legacies have suffered generational losses while they develop
plans to recover. Secondly, Senator Sam Watson, a proud farmer
himself, who also served as our lead on monitoring ongoing federal and state relief efforts for
our broader farm communities around our state.
Keeping up with what's going on in Washington
is a day-to-day responsibility.
Senator Watson's up for the task,
and he'll continue to work with our congressional delegations,
our U.S. Senators, and of course, our White House as well.
Finally, Senator Larry Walker would be evaluating
our consumer protections, including price gouging,
to understand how we can better protect everyday
Georgians in the aftermath of such disasters.
In the past, Senate Republicans have made various attempts at lawsuit reform with admittedly
limited success, and while some of our efforts came up short, it was simply due to disagreements
over how to achieve the correct balance point for the scales of justice.
What always remain true for our caucus and certainly hold true today is that we all
care about Georgian's litigation climate and how it adversely affects hard work in Georgians.
Governor Camp has made this a top priority for this session and I believe that he has adequately
articulated the need for such reform. He has highlighted a hospital in northeast Georgia
forced to close their labor and delivery unit due to workforce challenges and soaring insurance cost.
The South Georgia grocer that lost their insurance coverage completely because of frivolous
lawsuits were filed and the courts found in favor of the plaintiffs.
And countless other small businesses across the state that are just simply unable to afford
skyrocketing insurance cost which we've seen in excess of 25 to 50% in the last two to
three years.
As a small business owner himself, Governor Kemp noted, if you can't get insurance, you
can not run a business.
And if you can't pay your employees, and nobody can afford to spend years and millions
of dollars in the courtroom battling to keep the doors of their small businesses open.
As he said, we can't put a band-aid on this problem.
We've got to fix the root of the issue, and our caucus stands ready to be part of the
solution, we stand behind Governor Camp, Lieutenant Governor Jones and Speaker John Burns.
Most importantly, our caucus is prioritizing the security, whether it's physical, economic
and emotional of our state's greatest blessing, and that is our children.
We will protect them because they cannot protect themselves.
Their innocence must be guarded so their futures remain unlimited.
There will be another round of robust school safety grants this year.
In support of those grants, our caucus has prioritized two critical school safety measures.
Senator, end of the tard days, Ricky and Alisa's law would require all Georgia public schools to install mobile panic alarm systems directly linked to emergency responders and state and local law enforcement personnel.
The bill also mandates that each local school system procure local mapping data for each
public and private schools within its boundaries.
It should be noted that Ricky and Alessas Law is also deeply rooted in personal to three
of our senators here behind me.
Senator Clint Dixon, Senator Calzert, and Senator Frank Ginn, who serves the families of
Barrow County that was impacted last year by the tragic shooting at the Appalachian
high school in which coach Richard, Ricky William, Aspenwall, Aspenwall was killed just
last September. Additionally, Senator Dixon is invested in another caucus priority as
he and Senator Dolezal are working to ensure timely and accurate transfer of documents when
a troubled student changes schools from one jurisdiction to the other. Include, inside
those other safe schools, we want our students focused on the skills that set them up for
future success in the working world.
The number one skill which is foundational for all learning is the ability to read and
comprehend.
That is why Senate Republicans have made literacy a multi-year priority.
In past sessions, we have laid the groundwork for improving literacy, but our work has only
just begun.
With the leadership of our new Senate education chairman, Billy Hickman, who stands behind
today we will continue to build on this solid foundation. Finally our caucus
believes that safety for our children extends beyond the schoolhouse doors and
out onto the fields of competition. Security should be a filling not just
reserved for the classroom but also for the locker room. As mentioned before
Senator Greg Dolezal's fair and safe athletic opportunities act is a
priority for this caucus.
While I understand that there will be similar bills
introduced this session in the other chamber,
as well as the Senate, this comprehensive legislation
bans biological males from participating in women's sports
across Georgia, middle school, high school, and college.
The time of half-measures, exceptions, and workarounds
on this issue is over.
In closing, our caucus is doing what is hard to do.
The primary and essential things, things that are hard to see,
amidst the distractions of daily life,
things that we all take too often for granted,
and we will improve them wherever we can.
That's how we will get it done.
That's how we're ensuring that we restore a sense of security,
and a renewed optimism for our neighbors and our children,
the teacher and the farmer,
job creators and hardworking Georgians.
Thank you for coming today.
We're turning it over to you guys now
Let's take a few questions.
I think we're already putting funding in the budget if you look at the last three years
I think we've added millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars each year for that
and we'll continue to fund that,
I believe, into the foreseeable future,
which gives the local districts full of flexibility
in how they use those funds.
And that'll all be subject to appropriations
as we go forward this session.
That's right.
School safety. That is a bigger umbrella. Those are three categories with multiple pieces
of legislation under those three umbrellas.
I believe you'll see more efforts being put forth on what the governor announced two weeks
ago on the Pathways program.
I think the Senate is fully supportive of his efforts on that.
We do not support a full expansion of Medicaid at this time.
Thank y'all very much for giving us a great day.
Thank y'all very much.
