well good morning
let's have a good day today what do
y'all say
legislative day 37
before we have our devotion i would like
to
ask that you again remember
alicia johnson in the speaker's office
and her husband carl he
begins the next phase of his healing
today at emory
and uh
i know they
so appreciate the thoughts and prayers
that have
been offered up and i'd ask you to
continue to hold them close in your
hearts and
lift them up in prayer
we will begin our day with scripture
reading and prayer by the chaplain after
which we will pledge allegiance to the
flag
of our country
our chaplain this morning will be
introduced by the lady from the 153rd
house district
representative hopson representative
hopson
thank you mr speaker good morning
colleagues
um as you all know in this new world
we're living in right now um we are
facing a lot of different changes
one of the things that has changed
dramatically is um
sports um i'm missing espn like many of
you are i'm sure
i'm a
football mom i have a son who's about to
start football at duke
and two other sons that are playing so
football is very important but it's also
changed because of covet 19. and um you
know we're not certain how the you know
the new world of sports is going to play
out as we continue to um you know figure
out how we navigate through this new
world but for now i'm excited to at
least bring you something that's
football related um so today it gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you one
of albany's very own
former nfl player derek moore who is a
motivational speaker and he is also the
chaplain of the georgia tech football
team
derek is a graduate of northeastern
state university where he was first team
all-american in football and he went on
to play pro football with the atlanta
falcons in 1992 he also played for the
detroit lions and the carolina panthers
so
um you know just wanna
just you know give you guys something
that's football related but anyway um
one of the quotes that i found in
researching um mr moore
is
derek is very
is the very best at taking insights of
his experiences as a professional
football player and athlete and
translating those experiences into
corporate business leadership and team
building environments to motivate and
inspire audiences so i pray it is my
prayer today that he he inspires us as
we go through the business of today's um
today's activities and orders so
colleagues to
present to you today the chaplain of the
day my homeboy from albany georgia derek
moore
well good morning
it gives me
great pleasure
to serve as chaplain of the day and
address the georgia house of
representatives
it's a real honor i'm humbled by it
i want to thank you so tremendously for
tolerating me for just
three to five minutes
thank you the great state of georgia i
want to
thank you for all the things you do on
behalf of our great state
and representing us incredibly well
i will say
that i enjoy bringing
positive and good news
even in what sometimes appear to be a
bad news world
that there's still good news
in a bad news world
if you look hard enough and you look
close enough
typically it's
several inches from our noses
but there is good news in a bad news
world
i'm a georgia boy now
inside and out
i was born and raised down in albany
georgia
and i even currently have a daughter
who just graduated from the university
of georgia
and she'll actually be attending
graduate school
at the university of georgia god willing
this fall
now everywhere i go and make
presentations people ask me as a tech
man where i've worked georgia tech for
more than two decades
they often ask me how in the world did i
allow my daughter
to go to georgia
how did
my lovely wife of now 27 years and i
allow our daughter to go to athens
for undergraduate studies and now
graduate studies and i often respond to
that answer
with that is a classic example of what
we call bad parenting
well
she is uh
most proud of her experiences enjoy in
athens at the university of georgia and
kiddingly and jokingly i say that but i
have so many outstanding friends and uh
and good pals over at the university of
georgia
and we've enjoyed her experiences these
last couple of minutes i want to give
you a south georgia phrase to take away
and it's a phrase or a saying we've we
say quite a bit down in south georgia
and it's probably very prominent in
other places and it's usually it's when
you find yourself
in a tough spot
i don't know about you if you've ever
found yourself to be in a tough spot
or in difficult circumstances some
people would classify it as being
between a rock and a hard place where
it's difficult and as you look into our
culture currently we have a pandemic
on one hand and we've got social unrest
on another hand
and then you look around and you've got
every other issue and circumstance under
the sun
to still deal with on an ongoing basis
and it appears to be what we call a
perfect storm
a pandemic
social unrest
and all the other issues that's not only
facing our state but also
our nation and world
but i'll tell you the good news
if there was a way in it
there's a way out of it
if there was a way in this mess or this
pickle
that we're in and down in south georgia
we call that
being in a pickle
you wake up in the morning and read the
news and you turn on the television and
you see all of the the current reports
about this this pandemic and you look at
the social unrest issues and social
justice issues taking place all around
the country and world
and you say my god what a perfect storm
and we stand there and i say
if there was a way in this pickle
there is a way out of it
the bible talks about a way in these
last couple of minutes in john 14 and
six
the great bible man jesus according to
christian dome the christian faith and
one in which i still firmly hang my hat
jesus said to doubting thomas as he said
many things to him
he said to him as they reported then how
should we and how can we know the way
out of this
this mess this pickle we find ourselves
in how can we know
jesus said to him he says i am the way
i am the way
if there was a way in it there's a way
out of it and in the grand scheme of
things
he says
the only way out of this mess is through
me
because he can take an ugly mess and
turn it into a beautiful mess
so here we are this morning
dealing with this pickle we find
ourselves in
but the good news of the morning is that
we're going to get out of it
and that isn't a single day that i wake
up not believing it
and if we're going to get out of it i
want to
recommend two things that we consider
because those two things will serve as
our exit
out of this pickle i say that we're in
and they'll prompt us to solve it
we've got to use our two ears to listen
and our one brain to learn
and if we listen and learn
it provides a pathway out of
even a pandemic even
social unrest even every other
challenging item on your desk
if we become people who use both of our
ears to hear
and use our brains to learn
we can then find the right application
in action steps necessary
to go forward not only as a great state
but as a great people
and i firmly believe that we are always
better together than we can ever be a
part
when we come together as people
reasonable sensible
human beings
we then have the possibility of
discovering
where the exit out of this troubling
inexperience that we are all dealing
with and are going through so i leave
that with you
to listen and to learn and i close with
my tough person quote of the morning
that i tell my children
we raise them to be built for tough
times and tough moments
and we say tough
times don't last but tough people do
that we will outlast
even these dire circumstances that we
all face
and are quite honestly frightening
experiences
and i challenge them with those quotes
each morning i want to read the great
navy creed
they say that
for the navy diver that diving is the
most
dangerous job
in the navy
the navy diver is not a fighting
individual
but they are salvage expert
if it's lost on the water
they find it
if it's sunk
they bring it up
if it's in the way they move it
i don't know why anybody wants to be a
navy diver
i
i look at this pandemic and all of these
troubles
i i don't know why anybody wants to be a
representative
but that's what we do
that's who we are we welcome the
challenge we welcome the difficulty
because we are built for it and if
you're built for it we'll outlast it
we'll find a way out of it if there was
an entrance there's an exit and i pray
and hope that we keep
listening with both ears
and we keep learning with our minds
and we keep coming together as
reasonable and sensible people and i
assure you soon and very soon
unpredictably we'll find ourselves on
the other side of these extreme
situations and then i'll give you one
more piece only to wake up the next day
with a few more
if you will stand
and let us pray father in heaven thank
you for this great morning
we've declared it to be great
it starts with us it starts with
leadership
exemplary leadership
thank you for this great speaker
of this place thank you for these
representatives their families and all
of the people in the great state of
georgia
they represent
thank you oh great god for
giving us hope
we can live without a lot of things for
a long time but we can't live without
hope for one second and every morning we
awaken we have hope we pray for all of
those who are in even further difficult
circumstances all around our state and
world but oh god the bible says this is
the day the lord has made
let us
rejoice
in this day and let nothing remove take
away our ability to serve and love and
encourage each other in spite of even
tough business decisions that we all
have to undertake may you be glorified
in it in your great name amen
let us turn and
pledge allegiance i pledge
and to the allegiance
which is
one nation
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all
doorkeepers will unlock the
i got you to keep me doors
it's a full-time job i know
what an amazing message to begin today
with
i told him he was an amazing man
anybody that could be the chaplain of
the georgia tech football team knew
about tough challenges and tough times

thank you mr speaker

of a business leader who passed away in
sandersville georgia
on june 9th
mr benjamin james tarbutton jr
passed away at the age of 90.
sandersville
washington county
and the state of georgia
lost a businessman and a civic leader
with vision
kindness
generosity and integrity
ladies and gentlemen i ask that you
stand with me for a moment of silence
for mr ben tarbutton jr
thank you mr speaker i yield a well
chair recognizes the chair of the
house economic development and tourism
committee
chairman stevens for a morning order
thank you mr speaker ladies and
gentlemen house i'm here to tell you
today that jim crow laws are alive and
well
and i apologize if i'm just a little bit
emotional today but yesterday we had a
radio talk show just get up and flat out
live
let me tell you what happened yesterday
we had a bill
that went through the committee over
here of the regulated industries
committee and before the the bill was
even voted out we had the radio talk
show host just coming up and saying
something that's not true and he even
tweeted it let me read it to you
republicans in the georgia legislature
got democrats to support a casino in
exchange for gutting
the hope scholarship
which will exchange a portion from the
being based on the academics of the
student to how much money the parent
makes there is nothing further from the
truth let me tell you really quick what
passed out of the regulated industries
yesterday
sports betting 100
of the sports betting revenues 50 to 60
million dollars goes to exactly the way
that goes today right through the
lottery
and ladies and gentlemen is distributed
exactly the way that it's done
the new portion of the bill also created
destination resorts if and only if the
state of georgia puts it in the
constitution and if and only if your
local district votes for it period
what does it do
for the first time in our state's
history it creates a lock box an
emergency powers fund to be used only
for emergency number two it creates for
families that are 50 or below on their
income on new money from these
destination resorts and horse racing
for those median income folks those
folks that are foster kids that never
could afford even if they had a a
scholarship from hope they couldn't
afford to go to to go to school because
of the difference in tuition and their
in their hope or they couldn't afford
housing or books and fees or the mob
that's working two jobs by god they may
able to get in the in pre-k because she
didn't get picked from the lottery
ladies and gentlemen that's the truth of
what's happening yesterday shame on you
and it's about time that we allow folks
to vote because that's the core
of jim crow is keep the people from
voting i yield well
so let me see if i understand what you
said mr chairman a radio
talk show host
told a lie
is this the same one that's going to
seminary
told a lie
i don't i'm usually shelling peas at
that time of day and don't listen to
things like this
but
i'm shocked
i am truly shocked
chair recognizes for a morning order
chairman alan powell
thank you mr speaker and ladies and
gentlemen
you know i appreciate chairman stevens
coming down here and uh making
making his commentary but i'm down here
for the generally the same reason i
probably won't be near as uh
near as uh
verbal about some of this but i'm here
on behalf of the committee
uh
i don't know who this radio talk show
host is
but you know these these liberal uh
personalities
they get up and say anything
and i don't know if this is a guy i
don't know anything about him
but he's apparently very liberal in his
persuasion
and
i'm concerned about this
because he's impugned the character the
the
this house and the regulated industries
committee by
plane spokenly passing out a lie
i would in concern i'm more concerned
that these folks in the media
and especially those of the more
religious that hide behind the religious
cloak they need to read the eighth of
the ninth commandment depending on which
version that you're reading about
about basically misinformation lying
bearing false witness
chairman stevens talked about what was
in the bill he was pretty well right he
was a little bit off on the figures
but we put money we designated in that
if it's the will of the legislature to
put it on the ballot for the people of
georgia to vote for
we have constructed it as such
that all the sports betting money
can go to the lottery immediately
that's about 150 million
dollars guesstimated
and that would go a long way of helping
the lottery because we know how how they
can go through it like grist
and then yes there was a
and the other part of it where we put
the money
we created an emergency powers fund you
know a lot of us has been around we've
always been proud of the fact that we
had a shortfall reserve a rainy day fund
but folks that's not created
constitutionally or even statute
we just do it in the budget
this would create the emergency powers
fund
that if the people of georgia
choose to allow
destination casinos
sports betting horse racing
and that's if they do it then that money
within 10 percent of the previous year's
revenue would go to that lock box
basically
to preserve the future of this state in
case we have another
catastrophic event like the pandemic
and then the once filled up
then the bulk of that other money would
go to the opportunity fund that would be
based on the legislature creating those
folks under the 58 percentile range of
income
for pre-k or needs-based
scholarships or even better needs-based
loans but you know that's what will
happen in the bulk goes into the general
fund
now that being said ladies and gentlemen
i understand and the reason i'm here
this morning a lot of y'all have gotten
emails
so i would say to all those educated
folks in suburbia
that's concerned that he rang a bail on
the hope
in fear-mongering
learn how to read legislation
tune into the legislative website hear
the debate and don't rely on liberal

chair recognizes representative
hutchinson
for a morning order
representative you've got a minute and
40 seconds
thank you mr speaker i'll try to make
this
quick
when we left when we were dismissed from
the legislature i started charting the
day over day averages for new cases and
do new deaths
in georgia over for covid i stand before
you today because i want to show you my
chart from saturday
this saturday we had 800 new cases of
covet in georgia this is an all-time
high
i didn't put this chart up here for you
to look at the numbers because it's too
small i want you to see the trend lines
we are not going down
we have never gone down
and i am deeply disturbed at the
dismissive nature that is the narrative
over these coveted numbers
i'm being told that the governor met
with the hospital association and asked
them to prepare for the second wave
we're still on the first wave
this has not gone down not ever
it's been told that we test more and
that's why the numbers are up if we test
more
but the percentage of positives
remains the same
we still have a problem
we still have a problem but what we're
telling people is that everything is
okay
i'm a small business owner things can't
be closed forever but i think it's
irresponsible of us
to tell the people of georgia that the
that this crisis is either diminished or
going away and that they should take
less measures to keep themselves safe
the hospital beds are going up the
deaths are going up we lose an average
of 33 lives in georgia every single day
but
we
are in the summer
we have pool parties and beaches and i
am terrified that these numbers are
going to continue to go up we are not
going to have a second wave we'll
continue the wave we've been going on
thank you mr speaker and i yield well
that is all of our time today for
morning orders representative scott do
you want to be signed up tomorrow
okay we're going on to the rules
calendar
we are going on to the rules calendar
senate bill 442
was postponed yesterday until the next
legislative day and it is called at this
time
the clerk will read the caption to
senate bill 442.
senate bill 442 by senator ligand iii
kennedy the 18th hillary the 19th of
council of the 46th
he titled an act to amend title 44 the
official george annotated relating to
property
chose to prohibit amendments to property
owners association instruments and
covenants that restrict rental of
residential lots and plots
this bill had been referred to the
committee
this this hadn't been referred to the
committee on judiciary that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
chair recognizes representative washburn
to present the bill
thank you mr speaker
ladies and gentlemen the house i'm here
to present senate bill 442 and there is
a judiciary committee substitute
this bill has to do with property owners
association
changing rules
relative to the leasing
of real estate that is owned
when you or anyone buys a piece of real
estate
you certainly buy the property and you
buy the rights and privileges to go with
that
two basic rights are the right to sell
it
and also the right to convey it with a
leasehold interest or to lease it out
this bill is simple
it simply
requires that the rules can't be changed
in the middle of the game
property owners association can change
their rules with a two-thirds majority
this bill prohibits them from being able
to change those rules
on someone who owns real estate within
that property owner association's
jurisdiction
it does not pertain to any
short-term rentals
and it does allow that if the property
is sold that the new owner would be
bound by those rules that prohibit the
leasing of it
this has to do with private property
rights and it has to do with fairness
if you
or maybe one of your children happen to
own a piece of real estate
controlled by a property owners
association let's say your son or
daughter lives down in savannah and
they've bought that first home
and so then they get an offer of a good
job in atlanta
and so they move
well maybe the housing sale market is
not so good right now
and so they have a big old mortgage
payment to make they got to pay taxes
and insurance they got to maintain the
property
and if if they were allowed to if it was
allowed that they could be prohibited
from leasing that property
they would not be able to lease it
this is a fair bill
i do understand that there are concerns
in some communities i've had some emails
about things where people have some
neighbors who are causing problems and
happen to be tenants
well in my experience for a long time as
a real estate broker
and a property owner
you can have trouble some neighbors
but they might be property owners and
not necessarily just not necessarily
tenants
and so this bill is good for property
owners because it protects their right
to lease property it is also good for
tenants
most every one of us unless we're born
into great wealth
have been tenant at some time i have and
most of you have
and so to
charge that all tenants are bad or
troublesome
is not fair
this is a good bill
and i urge you a favorable consideration
of it mr speaker i'll be glad to take
any questions
i don't think you have any questions
thank you mr speaker i yield well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair hears
none
the committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair here's none the report of the
committee
is agreed to shall this bill now pass
all those in favor of the passage of
senate bill
442 will vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock

what purpose does representative
basemore arise
parliamentary incorrect state your
inquiry
is it not true that i've been
the president of my homeowners
association since o5
if the lady so states
and in that time
is it not true that i have seen an
increase
of purchases by out of state
agencies and companies
of homes
i'm sure the lady believes that to be
true
thank you mr speaker
okay members will look at the board and
make sure
that it is consistent
with your intention to vote
representative henson
up in the gallery
okay any other members
any other members
if not the clerk will lock the machines
on the passage of senate bill 442 the
eyes are 123.
the nays are 27.
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority
is therefore passed
what purpose does the chairman of the
rules committee rise
[Music]
state your inquiry mr speaker isn't it
true that last night i received a phone
call
and by the way it's a phone call from my
family down at the beach for this week
that i'm not at
um
but isn't it true the reason for that
phone call
they told me i was going to have my
first great grandchild
born this december
i would say that is
wonderful news yes sir and i think if
you take a look at our kids our
grandkids and our great-grandkids
they're a special gift from god to us
thank you sir amen
and i notice how you got in the fact
that where they were and where you are
so
clerk will read the caption to house
bill
1148
1148 house bill 1148
a representative housed in the 170th to
be told knack to amend the next change
provisions relating to the magistrate
court of berrien county approved march
18 1985 this bill hadn't referred to the
committee on intergovernmental
coordination
the committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes chairman houston to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker house bill 11
48 is basically in two parts
i uh represent berrien county and live
in bering county and the magistrate
court in berrien county has been
appointed for years by the superior
court judge there are very few counties
left that have appointed judges
and the people in my district
in my county wanted to change the
appointment of a magic court judge to to
be elected by the people
and
uh
so this elects the pro the master court
judge by the people instead of
appointing him the next phase part of
the bill
makes this a non-partisan race
we feel that
judges should be nonpartisan the best
person for the job
should be elected regardless of what
party they're in and we feel like that
everybody that comes to any court should
be treated the same
to emphasize that this is not a
not a partisan bill and i'm trying to
pull anything over on you
and keep a democrat from winning
i just want to tell you that we went 85
percent for kemp in the election so i
promise you i'm not trying to to to pull
anything on you i want it fair for
everybody
do i have any questions
thank you
does anybody really want to ask a
question after that
the lady has yielded the well we have a
minority report on the bill
under the rules of the house the
minority has
20 minutes to present their report
chair recognizes for the minority report
the minority leader of the house leader
trammell
thank you mr speaker i'm going to try to
make 20 minutes 20 seconds
because we all know how we feel about
judgeships and whether they should be
partisan or nonpartisan the only point i
want to make is we should do them all
the same way and we should have one bill
that decides permanently that magistrate
judges in the case of magistrate judges
probate judges in the case of probate
judges should all be nonpartisan we
shouldn't do it in accounting at a time
rule 50 provides that
issues affecting political partisanship
or general bills for the consideration
of the general assembly so let's do it
all or nothing that's the basis for the
minority report mr speaker i yield well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none
the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute
the chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill the chair here's
done the report of the committee is
agreed to
shall this bill now pass all those in
favor of the passage of house bill 1148
will vote i
those opposed will vote no

okay members will look at the board and
be sure that it is accurate
representative todd jones is in the uh
just come in
votes yes yes
they got her
members will look at the board and make
sure that it's accurate
and the clerk will lock the machine on
the passage of house bill 1148 the eyes
are 100 the nays are 57.
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority
is therefore passed
clerk will read the caption to
house bill 1190
house bill 1195 by representative
houston 170th to be told an act to
provide that future elections for the
office probate judge of barren county
shall be nonpartisan elections this bill
have referred to the committee on
intergovernmental coordination local
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
chair recognizes chairman houston to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker i presented you
another bill making the probate judge
in court in berrien county nonpartisan
and i am so glad to see that our dean
of this house had a tag on that said
justice for all because by making it
nonpartisan it means justice for all and
so i know that's what the dean means
[Laughter]
so
i tell you uh
this is not a
par i'm not trying to steer this to be
to any party we just want everybody to
pick the best judge they have
and uh
you know if you think you know what's
best for my county just uh somebody was
asking me today another member of the
concord said well we're afraid that your
population is going to increase so much
in the census that it's going to make a
difference well we wish that rural
georgia would grow that much but i hate
to tell you the census is not going to
make any difference
thank you and i'd appreciate a yes vote
and i don't think i need to remind you
how we went in the last two elections to
show you it's not partisan thank you do
you yield for questions be glad to
chair recognizes representative beth
moore in the gallery to your right for a
question is this a friendly question yes
thank you
[Laughter]
does the gentle lady yield
yes
isn't it true that
although you and i hail from different
parts of the state
and represent different parties
that you and i are actually cousins
related through marriage yes that is
true
and i do appreciate your vote the last
time and i hope you realize blood is
thicker than water yes sir
this is gentlely yield for one more
question yes
uh
yeah it is true i did vote yes on the
last one um but isn't it also true that
the reason i will vote no on this next
one is because we do have a bill
available that would make all judicial
elections nonpartisan which is a bill
that i'm very much favored but that i
otherwise appreciate you bringing these
bills is it not true that i told the
author of the bill that i hoped he would
let me sign it the next election on the
next session and i agree with you all
judges should be non-partisan but you
know right now we're just trying to
get what the people wanted in my
district and trying to have fair
elections and everybody in the court
should be treated equal thank you and i
yield the wealth
do you yield for any other questions
it's up to you i'll answer one more
chair recognizes representative mccloud
oh okay
up in the gallery in the middle
okay
does that generally later yield yes
okay
so does it is it not true that um
non-partisan
elections actually make it more
difficult for those attorneys running
for judges
is it not true that when we run
nonpartisan it actually makes it more
difficult for the candidate running to
actually get their message out in the
short period of time that they have
as a nonpartisan candidate
well i don't think a non-partisan maybe
i don't understand because i think when
the judges
somebody's judging a case they ought to
go by the law not whether they think
their political party thinks but is it
not true that they are running as
partisan they actually run the campaign
like any other candidate that's running
for election i don't think judges do
where i'm from
they have to market they have to send
out flyers
i i don't think i i don't think i don't
know any
judges on a probate court or a ministry
court that sends out flyers that's not
in my district they do in bernie county
well i hope when you go to court
everybody treats you fairly and doesn't
judge you about it
i would expect that no matter what the
party i would expect that from a judge
thank you thank you
lady has yielded the well
we have a minority report
and under the rules of the house the
minority report is entitled for up to 20
minutes
chair recognizes leader trammell to give
the minority report
thank you mr speaker i would refer the
house to the comments i gave a few
moments ago i yield the well
now that is a good example of brevity
thank you mr leader

is
all right members will look at the board
and make sure
that it is accurate
members will look at the board
the clerk will lock the machine on the
passage of house bill 1195.
the eyes are 98
the nays are 58.
59 i'm sorry
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
clerk will read the caption to senate
bill 435
senate bill 435 by senator strickland
the 17th tillery the 19th kirkpatrick
the 32nd albers the 56th and others be
titled act two men are going to chapter
10 of title 17 in article 2 chapter 3
title 35
the official georgia annotator relating
to procedure for sentencing and
impossession of punishment and the
georgia crime information center this
bill has referred to the committee on
judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
chair recognizes
chairman bonnie rich to present the bill
thank you mr speaker my colleagues i
bring to you today senate bill 435 also
known as the survivor's first act
and previously known as the debbie vance
act who
passed away unexpectedly last may
who was one of our courageous victim
survivors of human trafficking
part of our state's priority
is to give victims of human trafficking
and opportunity to move forward with
their lives after they have
escaped
victims of human trafficking often come
out with criminal arrests and
convictions for offenses ranging from
prostitution to drug-related offenses to
shoplifting
these convictions can prevent these
victims
from moving ahead with their lives it
can they can prevent them from getting a
job
housing and an education
this bill authorizes the vacating and
sometimes the lesser
of restricting of reporting of
convictions and sentencing for those who
have obtained them as a result of being
a victim of human trafficking for labor
or sexual servitude
two years ago
the street grace survivor advisory board
met to discuss human trafficking policy
changes that were needed in our state
and they identified this bill as their
priority policy
not only did these survivor leaders
identify this as their key policy
provide priority but they brought this
idea to first lady kemp
and then sat with attorneys in the
governor's office to help craft the key
details of this legislation
this legislation
is a great example of our legislature
listening to the human trafficking
survivors and overcomers who have
first-hand expertise in this area
and is being held up nationally as an
example of the good that can come
when survivors are not just invited to
the table
to exploit them for their moving stories
but are treated as the experts that they
truly are
i have a statement from
the street grace survivor advisor
board co-chair nikki burrell
she says as a trafficking survivor
myself
i understand the importance of having to
rebuild my life after severe complex
trauma
part of my trauma while i was trafficked
included an arrest and i am not alone in
this
many many trafficking survivors have
been arrested while being forced to
commit crimes during the duress of their
experience
just to survive their everyday life
consider if it were your son
daughter niece nephew granddaughter or
grandson who was caught in the arms of a
trafficker
and had no way to survive
but to do
what he or she was told to do
which was prostitution petty crimes etc
trafficking victims often feel there is
no choice involved other than the choice
to stay alive
once given the opportunity to escape
survivors are given the opportunity for
a brand new start some of them need help
rebuilding their lives which includes
getting a job a home a checking account
things that most of us take for granted
often after years of restorative care
our victims have trouble getting any of
these things because of their criminal
records
but ladies and gentlemen the survivors
first act will allow these victims to
break past their barriers that stop them
from living their everyday life
it's our civic duty
and our moral responsibility one we must
consider as we fight against the
horrific trafficking that happens in our
state
to give
these victims the opportunity that they
deserve
mr speaker i will yield for any
questions
you have a question if you care to yield
i do chair recognizes chairman silcox to
your right for a
question i do
isn't it true representative rich that
this bill will allow
judges to completely vacate convictions
and sentences of defendants you've been
victims of sex trafficking
yes that is true
isn't it also true represent rich that
this will greatly further the work of
the grace commission and first lady
marty kemp's work yes it will thank you
for the question thank you for bringing
the bill and it's important to note that
it does allow judges that option and if
necessary there will be a full
evidentiary hearing
so as to prevent any abuse we've made
sure that everything is locked down very
carefully in this thank you for your
question mr speaker i yield the well
lady has yielded the well is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered the chair hears none
the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair hears none the report
of the committee is agreed to shall this
bill now pass
all those in favor of the passage of the
bill will vote i
those opposed to vote no and the clerk

no you need to you need to
pull that down
okay
bennett
okay they have you
did he vote
yes
okay
members
one final look at the board
the clerk will lock the machine on the
passage of senate bill 435
the eyes are 161 the nays are zero
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
clerk will read the caption to senate
bill 123.
senate bill 123
by senator ligand iii watson the first
kirkpatrick the 13th oracle 36 jones the
25th and others will be titled enact two
men chapter 8 of title 12 the official
george annotator relating to waste
management so as to eliminate the coal
ash surcharge this bill had referred to
the committee on natural resources
environment that committee recommends
that this bill do pass
by committee
substitute ladies and gentlemen of the
house for the final time
chair recognizes
representative terry rogers to present a
bill in this case it's senate bill 123.
thank you mr speaker um yeah this is
kind of tough final bill
but uh it uh it's a very aptly name bill
it's uh senate bill 123 that's sb123 and
it's a simple bill
and it's as easy as one two three
so there you go
um three parts to this bill i'm gonna
address uh two of them you know fairly
much in depth and then i think that
we're going to have another member
that's going to speak to the second part
part one it's a natural resources bill
and it deals with hazard's waste solid
waste things of that nature part one is
landfills most of you who live in rural
counties know how important landfills
are
a couple of years ago a long time ago
matter of fact in 1997 the house uh
passed a bill and said it's going to
come back to haunt us but we're going to
do it anyway
they moved the
they moved to where you could not
expand the landfill more than two miles
or or you had to be two miles away from
a uh
military installation and um that had
bombing ranges
and as you guys know things have changed
and what this bill does it's if if you
are an improved landfill as of 1997
and going forward you can now expand uh
your limits right there this is
especially important to a lot of
counties rural counties because we all
know how important
lands are land is right now and so what
that does it does that
it just goes ahead and expands that
takes care of that problem that was
created 30 years ago
second thing
it deals with is coal ash
and
basically what we're doing on the coal
ash is right now it's a dollar per ton
it fluctuates
uh what this will do is make coal ash
two dollars and fifty cents a ton
and then twenty percent of that will go
back uh to um
to the counties for remediation for some
really good programs such as
recycling things of that nature
education cleanup and i think
representative meeks is going to speak
to that
and then the third thing is a bill that
uh hb 926 that passed out of natural
resources unanimously
uh
and then somehow another got caught up
during all the covet stuff and did not
get on the floor so
hb 926 is put on there it is the solid
waste fund and the hazardous waste fund
trust fund
and basically what it does is it makes
solid waste
75 cents a ton and then um and then
tires
uh a dollar per tire
these funds will be used to maintain um
cleanups things of that nature and i
want to give a special
shout out when it went through the
committee it was very much of a
nonpartisan sort of thing
democrats on the committee as well as
republicans looked and said hey there
needs to be better transparency on this
thing and so what we're doing is we
already had a report coming from epd to
the natural resources committee that
talked about where the money was being
spent
and
for
for uh hazardous waste but it didn't
have it for solid waste so we've
put that into the bill to where now
solid waste will report back and give a
full thing give a full accounting so
that's the bill in a nutshell uh it's a
pretty simple bill
it's a good bill it generates a lot of
money that does a lot of good things i'm
very excited about the fact that 20 are
going back
to education programs things of that
nature and mr speaker that's pretty much
it
i do not yeah you have a question do you
yield yes sir
chair recognizes representative jasmine
clark up in the gallery to your right
yes ma'am
yes ma'am
lc um you're reading from
what lc number yes
you know
it is lc411518s
i do not have a copy of that
in our notebook so that's the reason i
was asking okay yes ma'am this was a
substitute that we did because there was
a glitch in the thing and i will add
also that what this does is it sunsets
on the solid waveness and the hazardous
waste in 2025 and that was what the uh
that's probably what the real substitute
was
okay
thank you thank you ma'am
do you further yield
yes sir chair recognizes representative
kirby
in room 341.
do i have to take that
the the 341 caucus objects to that
representative rogers so
will you yield yes sir
just a simple question if i understand
right without the passages of this bill
is this the one that's going to leave us
a big hole in the budget that we
this bill is going to fill uh it would
leave about a 20 billion dollar hole in
the budget that is correct
okay so passing this bill will close
that 20 million hole for us uh it will
go a long way yes it's my understanding
i'm not certain of the exact number
that's the last number that i saw on it
thank you sir thank you
you have one more question if you care
to yield yes sir i yield for one more
chair recognizes representative carter
up in the gallery
just to the right of the middle yes
yes ma'am would you please repeat the
lc number i believe we have the wrong
one
uh the lc number that i have in front of
me is lc441518s
yes ma'am
would it be possible if you would allow
us to receive the bill table this is
something or is that a question
i think i think the
the reality of the situation is if there
is a little bit of confusion there right
there the only thing might be with it
with a date change on it i really don't
think it has a
a um
we had some we had some language in here
that went from 2019 to 2020 that had not
been updated that would have been the
only thing would have been updated
language quite frankly ma'am i just
don't believe it would have an impact on
the bill
further yes ma'am
isn't that true that there is an
excessive amount of landfills that are
in black communities
ma'am i could not answer that
further yes ma'am for one more
and
in my area alone we're seeing an excess
of
recycling and landfills that directly
affects the health of our community so
could you help me understand what's the
benefit of passing this legislation
you're talking about the legislation
regarding the landfills yes ma'am one of
the things that is
is a good thing about this if you're
talking about the expansion of the
landfills
it's because of the fact that
otherwise people would be forced to go
out and to buy more expensive properties
somewhere else this is just a complete
total thing i think what you'll see is a
benefit there of reduced taxes and
probably if they're expanding more jobs
created i do not believe it will have a
health impact because of because the uh
landfills are already there
so mr speaker
you have another question but to the
representatives
that
were concerned about not having the
proper
lc number there's a table outside the
gallery
with the
copies of legislation on it so uh
you might want to check that
you have another question if you yield
if you care to you
i'll yell for one more chair recognizes
representative al williams to your left
for a question
i knew that i could not get out of here
without hearing from my good friend
yes sir i miss saying this but
i do know that there is
a landfill bill
that directly impacts macintosh county
that is attached to it it's part of
mcintosh county that i used to represent
but is it not true
that this landfill is 10 miles from the
closest house
and sits next to the bombing range from
the beaufort air station and there will
be no impact on the african-american
community in macintosh county i will
yield to the wisdom of my friend from
liberty county
who knows a thing or two about macintosh
county too i tell you what
mr speaker with that
i
would ask for your favorable
consideration this bill it's a good bill
closes a tremendous gap in the budget it
does some good things i love the fact
that there was non-po there was partisan
nonpartisan participation throughout the
whole bill it benefits all of georgia
and i would
like to end by asking for your vote
and your favorable consideration of sb
123 and i think at this time i will
yield the well and turn it over to
representative mix
that's my job
your job is just to yield a well mr
speaker at this time i think i'm just
going to yield the boil and let you do
your job
chair recognizes representative meeks to
speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker ladies and
gentlemen i appreciate the opportunity
to come before you today to offer a few
words on senate bill 123
senate bill 123 also includes the
language of house bill 959
which was voted on this body earlier
this year by a vote of 162-1
this portion of the bill deals with the
tipping fees of coal ash which is a very
important issue and my district at home
and very important to the the people of
wayne county and surrounding counties it
simply does nothing more than raise the
tipping fee to 2.50 per ton which was a
delay in implementation of legislation
that was passed by this body more than
two years ago
given that
there are other facilities around the
country that bearing mandated to be
excavated and cleaned up we certainly
don't want the out-of-state coal ash to
come to our state so i would urge a
favorable consideration on house bill or
senate bill 123 and mr speaker unless we
have a question are you at the well
you have a question if you care to yield
yes sir mr speaker
chair recognizes the majority leader of
the house
leader burns for a question
yes sir
can you tell me who was the author of
the bill
that left this house uh myself
representative stephen makes we uh we
appreciate that with the gentleman yield
for
further questions yes sir
is it not true that you've been one of
the leaders in this house
as far as being considerate
and being proactive isn't protecting our
environment and protecting our citizens
and dealing with this uh with the issue
of coal ash in the state of georgia yes
sir as a farmer i understand the
importance of our natural resources and
you know what you speak
the first of our members thank you thank
you
thank you mr speaker all you other well
gentlemen has yielded the well
okay here's what we're going to do um
have copies i understand copies uh mr
clerk are
there or will be
in seconds
is that accurate
additional copies are being sent
the chair
rather than table the bill
after this debate is going to
ask members to be at ease for about five
minutes
go out and get a copy
take we're going to take about five
minutes and let you review that and then
we're going to vote
okay we're going to
we're going to vote now

members will
look at the board and make sure that it
is consistent with your intention
clerk will lock the machines on the
passage of senate bill 123.
the eyes are 142 the nays are
15.
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed
clerk will read the caption to senate
resolution 19.
senate resolution 19 by senator beech
the 21st scooch the 51st watson the
first mill of the 49th and douglas 30th
a resolution creating the georgia
commission on freight and logistics this
this resolution ever for the committee
on rules that committee recommends that
this
resolution be adopted
by rule substitute
chair recognizes the majority leader of
the house to present the resolution
thank you mr speaker mr clerk to make
sure we're on the right one is this lc
28
9836
it is
thank you mr clerk
colleagues uh good afternoon now
uh last week we considered a change to
the rules of this house
by adapting those changes in our rules
it allowed us some flexibility in how
we pursue the business of this house for
the benefit of the people of georgia
today
the substitute to sr19
is a constitutional amendment
that codifies those rules in our
constitution
this resolution provides
proposes a constitutional amendment to
the georgia constitution
and puts a referendum on the ballot for
the voters of georgia to consider the
language to provide for alternative
meetings locations and our alternative
meeting means in certain emergency
situations i'll go through the bill
the substitute
section one
this language has been added to clarify
language already in the constitution
that the houses need the consent of both
chambers both chambers before they can
meet somewhere other than this capital
or
adjourn for more than three days without
the consent of the other chamber that's
just clarifying language
now the language in section one that's
been added
when it is difficult or impossible
to meet in the capital because of an
emergency affecting the state due to
enemy attack
natural or man-made disaster or pandemic
the general assembly can meet through
electronic means or at another location
subject to general assembly rules or as
provided by law
for the house
the new rules that we passed leaked last
week and the rules that we abide by in
this chamber would control
if the general assembly does meet
electronically the following
requirements will be in place along with
the rules of the general assembly in our
case the rules of the house
members must be able to observe and hear
meetings discussions to be a part of
meetings discussions debate make
statements and see votes of the other
members the general public
this must be a transparent process the
general public must be able to observe
and hear meetings discussion debate
statements and votes of the members
members must be able to see our see the
contents of legislation
being considered by either the house or
a committee
members can submit legislation
amendments
documents electronically in accordance
with the rules of this house of course
the senate
in section two
we're amending a section that certainly
that already exists in our constitution
currently the general assembly is able
to suspend the rules that apply
to it in in the georgia constitution
only when a disaster is caused by an
enemy attack
this section is being amended to allow
for the general assembly to suspend the
legislative rules in the georgia
constitution when there is an enemy
attack
natural or man-made disaster or pandemic
and certainly when the general assembly
deems it necessary to do these to do to
these circumstances
this
section is this is this language is
similar to the emergency powers
that the governor can be granted and
ensures that we the general assembly can
continue its function and carry out its
responsibilities in the same way the
governor can under his emergency powers
this simply helps us to maintain the
balance of power in the system of checks
and balances between the branches of
government especially important to times
due in emergency situations
the last section section 3 simply states
the language that would be on the ballot
shall the constitution of georgia be
amended so as to provide that the
general assembly may meet in places
other than the state capitol or by
electronic means in the event of an
emergency situation
ladies and gentlemen this is a
continuation
of this body
to make sure we can conduct the people
people's business of this state in any
circumstances that may arise in our
future we certainly understand now in
the environment that we are operating in
that we're exposed to
that we cannot predict the future
if we do i'm wrong when i predict the
future
but um this will allow us the tools to
make sure we take care of the people's
business in an open and transparent
manner just as we're doing business here
today but in different forms that are
will be available to us as we move on
continue through the 21st century
and into the future that make sure we
employ the tools that allow us to do the
people's business and open transparent
and respectful matter mr speaker that's
what this um
this resolution
this constitutional amendment would do
for the for this chamber for the general
assembly and for the people of georgia i
would take any questions if there are
any if not mr speaker i'd be glad to
yield the well
you do have a question if you yield
yes sir i'll take a question
chair recognizes representative jasmine
clark up in the gallery in the middle
yes i yield to the lady in the balcony
first thank you for this i think it's
really important that we do think ahead
and be better equipped and better
prepared for something like what we are
experiencing now especially knowing that
there are still
possible cases even in this building as
we speak
the question i have is about electronic
signatures
for
legislation i didn't see anything
specific
to that is there anything that might
preclude
electronic signatures or is there
something that might need to be added to
make sure that we
can
sign things electronically such as
legislation and things of that nature
i believe that
the the rules of this house certainly on
any on any specific matter would control
as well as the um
the the letter of the
the constitution but no we will employ
electronic means that comply with the
open transparent
means that we function in and i think as
long as they comply with our rules
electronic signatures and any other
developments and technology that are
currently in place now or could be in
the future would certainly be a part of
how we do business here so i don't think
that would be an issue
thank you very much you're welcome
i do not see any other questions thank
you mr speaker
thank you ladies and gentlemen this is
important for for us as we move into the
future i would ask for your favorite
favorable consideration so we may be may
be prepared as we do the people's
business today tomorrow and in the
future thank you now you are the will
gentleman has yielded the well

question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered

the committee substitute the chair
here's known the committee substitute is

members will
check the board and make sure that it is
accurate
and the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of senate bill 474
the eyes are
156 the nays are zero
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority
is therefore passed
the next item of business will be
taking up a motion
on a senate sub
[Music]
and i'm going to take ask you to take
two or three minutes just a minute mr
chairman
the
senate sub is outside the door
on the tables
senate sub to house bill 838
it's also on the tables
outside the gallery and outside room
341.
get those and come back in because the
senate is taking up a
an important measure that i
am hopeful they will pass and
immediately transmit to us
okay i'm going to assume
that everybody has
a copy of senate sub of the senate
substitute house bill 838
this house will come to order
house will be in order
the chair recognizes chairman
bill hitchens for a motion
thank you mr speaker i make a motion to
agree to the senate substitute to house
bill 838
chairman hitchens has moved that the
house agree
to the senate substitute to house bill
838 the clerk will read the caption
house bill 838 by
representative hitchens 161st lot of the
122nd jaspers the 11th and others to be
entitled enact to amend code section 24
5 510 in article 8 of chapter 2 of title
35 the official georgia entertainer
relating to privileged communications
between law enforcement officers and
peer counselors
the chair recognizes
the chair of the public safety and
homeland security committee chairman
hitchins
to carefully and thoroughly explain
the senate substitute to house bill 838
thank you mr speaker
i know that you just got a copy of this
and i'll
be very honest with you i got a copy of
it about five minutes ago and uh it's uh
it's a very very detailed bill
if you look at the first part of it up
to section four it's the original bill
that passed this house before we
went on break
before crossover
and what it was was a bill some of you
probably remember three or four years
ago i had a bill that was passed here
called the
peace officer the public safety officer
support bill and what it did was it
provided services for
personnel law enforcement officers
firemen emt 911 operators
who were involved in number one in
traumatic incidents somebody was killed
they were in a shooting they
had to remove some
dead child from a
home that had been burnt
and and we had a lot of a lot of people
come forward with some
with some first-person stories in our
committee hearings and
we ended up getting that passed
and uh
i think it's been very effective for the
last couple years the the organization
now routinely goes out to these
events when they occur and if they
aren't successful
i started it in the department of public
safety in 2005.
and we had a guy there that was very
fortunate that had a master's degree in
clinical psychology and was a licensed
clinical psychologist so we put him in
charge of that and he's done a great job
with it
i was notified this year
that by legislative council
that they thought there was some errors
in this bill
and if you'll notice on page one and a
little bit on page two
in several places you see public safety
officer support
and officers deleted
what they said was that if there was any
controversy in the future
that
perhaps firemen
emts
and 9-1-1 operators wouldn't be eligible
for this service
because it said officer and that
typically means a law enforcement
officer
so i introduced a bill i think it passed
here
with very few negative comments or or
votes
and then uh
today i get this amendment
which begins in section five
and i'm gonna read the verbatim since
you just got it but it says a peace
officer should have the right to bring a
civil suit against any person
group of persons organization or
corporation
or the head of a corporate organization
or corporation for damages either
concunary or otherwise suffer during the
officer's performance of official duties
for abridgement of the officer's civil
rights arising under the officer's
performance of official duties or for
filing a complaint against the officer
which the person knew was false when it
was filed
now i think all of you know i spent 43
years in public safety in a very variety
of different capacities from the state
patrol to
the governor's criminal justice
coordinating council and as georgia's
first homeland security director
prior to the mid 80s
these types of complaints were he said
she said
we had somehow
interviewed people investigate the facts
as we knew them
and make a subjective decision about who
was right and who was wrong
in
1985 i was the post commander of the
state patrol office in savannah
and they wanted to try out cameras
and vehicles
and i volunteered to be
one of the posts where we did it on
experimental basis
i had a trooper down there who probably
made more
drug arrests on i-95 you know it was the
main through fair it used to be that
most of the drugs coming out of south
america would come through miami and
then they would be distributed by 95 all
the way to new york and
maine
he
he caught a load of drugs about every
every third night
and uh
so we put the camera in his car because
i wanted to see number one how he was
doing it
uh to make sure that he wouldn't violate
anybody's rights or saying anything that
he shouldn't say and
and he didn't have it about four nights
and he shot a guy
and uh
you know
the attorney for the other fellow and
the media were all on us about uh
unjustifiable shooting
well there was a camera in the car and
nobody knew anything about him at that
time
we pulled the video and watched it and
the commissioner came down at that time
and we watched it
and it was the passenger wasn't a driver
and it was loaded with dope
but what happened was the passenger fell
out with his right leg had a gun in his
hand
and the trooper told him 21 times on
tape to drop the gun
and when he didn't drop the gun
he started a forward movement and the
trooper shot him
fortunately the guy survived but
you know i have no idea what would have
happened with that case if we hadn't had
a camera shortly thereafter
we put cameras in all our cars and uh
you know
it uh it's been it's been a very
positive thing from two perspectives
primarily that we actually see what what
transpires but it protects the officer
when he does the right thing
and it allows us to take action against
him when he's done the wrong thing
and uh
i've found several cases on both sides
where we probably wouldn't come to that
decision that we not had the camera
i had a
fella to work for me
and most of you in here know him and i'm
not going to mention any names
al williams
no no but
he worked up in blue ridge a place many
of you have probably heard of through
the years here but he wrote a lady a
citation
and
when he went to court the trooper
outlined the case and asked the lady
what she had to say
and she said basically she may have been
speeding she wasn't sure
but the trooper made some improper
suggestions to her that she was offended
by
and they had a lady judge
and she questioned the trooper and said
what in the world were you doing
he said i wasn't doing anything
and if you'll give me 45 minutes till i
can go get an nco to get the tape
out of storage in our evidence locker
i'll bring it back and you can watch it
and that occurred and when the judge
watched it in her chambers and came back
out
she sends the lady for to two weeks in
jail for for lying about what happened
because none of that ever occurred
and i had another case and i know i'm
going on and on here but
that occurred in emanuel county
and a
a preacher that i knew very well
called me
and accused a
trooper who had stopped his friend from
speeding he was following along in
another car but he said he got out and
he listened to it and the trooper was
very obviously racist
and i knew him i knew the trooper and i
didn't believe it to be the case and
so he said what are you going to do
about it i said we're going to
investigate it he said what do you mean
investigate how are you going to do that
i said the first thing we're going to do
is pull the tape recording
of what actually
occurred
he said what do you mean a tape
recording i said oh our cars are
equipped with tapes
and whatever occurred there will be
pretty obvious to us when we look at it
so i had him pull the tape
and
nothing happened
the preacher and his acquaintance were
very unhappy about getting a citation
but he hadn't done a thing
and
and i say that to say we had one more
and i could go on all day
my wife take your time now
john burns knows it but my wife once
said i can talk the longest and say the
least of anybody she knows but
and as we go further into this you'll
see what i'm talking about but we had
another one down in cordeal
where they uh they arrested a
an individual for drunk driving
about five years previous we had had a
similar incident down there where the
guy had pulled a gun and shot and killed
the chief of police down there
and uh and one of our troopers and
injured injured the sheriff in the jail
and
[Music]
although he uh
he got the death penalty out of it i uh
in the second case
well after he was already arrested for
dui and they were escorting him to the
jail cell the guy sucker punched the
trooper broke his nose and jaw
and uh we were prohibited
by rule from suing and i just thought it
was uh it was dastardly uh
certainly he deserved to be sued and
luckily workman's comp paid for it but i
thought he ought to get some damages
from something that
should have never occurred
now section five
is a little
a little more stringent
section six i'm sorry
no it's the end of section five it's
section six
i just got this
as usual in this code section it refers
to first responder
which means any firefighter municipal
county or volunteer fire department a
peace officer is defined in code section
and an emergency medical technician
a person commits the offense
of bias motivated intimidation when such
person maliciously and with a specific
intent to intimidate harass or terrorize
another person
because of that person's actual or
perceived employment as a first
responder
causes death or serious bodily harm to
another person or causes damage to or
destroys any real or personal property
of a person because of actual perceived
employment as a first responder without
permission and the amount of the damage
exceeds 500 of the value of the property
destroyed exceeds 500
any person violates subsection b of this
code should be guilty of the offense of
biased motive intimidation upon
conviction thereof should be punished by
imprisonment i'm not less than one or
more than five
a fine of not more than five thousand or
both
so you could say it becomes a
felony
but it's a serious thing and it occurs
all the time to law enforcement officers
and much less infrequently to
firemen
but i've had people come to my house on
several occasions because i've had some
dealings with them and
in the law enforcement capacity
and i'm pretty proud of my record in 43
years i had one complaint and it
occurred on the first day i was on the
road by myself
and the complaint the complainant said
he didn't like getting a ticket
so uh you know i've dealt with thousands
and thousands of people and
in a lot of variety of different uh
instances and many very emotional
and i've always thought i was fairly
good at verbal judo and
being able to minimize what was going on
now some people you just can't do it
with
but
a lot of our law enforcement personnel
across the state are
are subjected to
a lot of uh
uh
what would be criminal activity if this
passes
just because they're they do what they
do
and i can go on i had one up in
up in madison just before i retired
and they they got into a chase and had a
shootout
and uh the guy was shooting at them and
the covington police asked to ask for
the troopers to come help
and uh the trooper ended up shooting and
killing the guy
well his brother was in prison
uh and this guy had been in prison
before
and the gbi told us that through the
prison system they got word that he put
out a contract on the trooper
they live in the same little town about
two miles apart and they see each other
at walmart around the shopping centers
all the time
and every time he saw him he made
threatening gestures or remarks
and my understanding is if this passes
something like that can be dealt with i
don't know that you get one to five but
certainly they ought to be circumvented
from
from being able to threaten or
intimidate based on a job
i'm looking at the minority leader and i
know i was involved in a case over in
statesboro
i'm going to tell you a lot after we get
done here today
but
he had he'd represented a fellow who got
five years in prison
and after the guy came back got out he
came to his office
uh pulled a pistol on him and we spent
three days negotiating before we got him
released
uh
and he really thought that he was gonna
take care of him but uh
you probably see his ads on tv all the
time if you live in the savannah area
he's got an add-on about every 30
minutes now
but
and i say that to say
these are routine issues
i know some people don't uh
don't think that
and i've heard many people say it
that's part of their job
i really don't think it's part of their
job to be subjected to that kind of
treatment on a regular basis
uh we're going to leave it up to you
here today to decide whether it is or
not and
i just asked for your favorable
consideration i think it's
a lot of things going on in our society
today and
i've often said here really that
the pillars that uh uphold our society
have some serious cracks in them and i i
worry about
what's going to transpire in the coming
years and
but i offered up for you
i asked for your favorable consideration
and i'd be glad to take any questions
do yield for questions
mr chairman yes i yield
do you need a bottle of water no i'm
i'm good to go all right
chair recognizes
the minority leader leader trammell to
your left for a question
thank you mr speaker will the gentleman
yield sure
isn't it true that the law already
provides
specific penalty enhancements or crimes
in in the case when those crimes are
against police officers and first
responders
uh
i think they're very limited
in certain cases
will the gentleman further you know sure
isn't it true that the list of crimes
already in statute include aggravated
assault upon a public safety officer
about discharge of a firearm aggravated
assault upon a public safety office
without discharge a firearm and does not
involve only the use of a person's body
aggravated assault upon a public safety
officer only involving the use of a
person's body aggravated assault by
strangulation of law enforcement simple
battery against police officer
aggravated battery upon a public safety
officer obstructing of an officer felony
obstruction of an officer fell in the
obstruction of an officer by throwing
human or animal bodily waste removal or
attempted removal of a weapon from a
peace officer user of laser devices
against the law enforcement officer and
similar crimes against first responders
and firemen
that's correct but it's it's uh
the specific charge is already there but
it's much like another bill that we're
going to
look at here probably in the next day or
two that the charge is already in place
but uh they're trying to add some some
additional charges based on
sex race culture
[Music]
religion
do you further you i do
chair recognizes representative wolinski
up in the gallery in the middle
thank you speaker does the gentleman
yield sure
uh i first like to let you know that i
am a
civil attorney so i knew that new civil
claims i would be very excited about but
i'm concerned
about one thing on page two
as i read lines 15-53
it reads a peace officer shall have the
right to bring a civil suit against any
person yada yada listed more
suffer during the officer's performance
of official duties
what does that mean
well
i would think that it would mean that
there are many things said that are
captured on tape that are very
derogatory and
pretty explicit from time to time and
i think if if that occurs
i think right now they have the
capability the problem is many law
enforcement agencies and and ours was
one of them has a policy manual and it's
that thick about additional rule and
regulations that you have
with regard to how you carry out your
duties and they prohibit
this type of activity does it generally
yield sure sure
just as i read again right to bring a
suitable suit against any perfect
suffered during the officer's
performance
what is suffered what is the claim there
well i think it's uh
deflamatory
on in many cases when
i've been called a lot of names other
people been called names
and it
uh i certainly wasn't in the performance
of a law enforcement duty but i got uh
i was
had somebody say in a
fish in an article here in
atlanta uh last week that i was a card
carrying member of a terrorist
organization
and i took great offense at that
i've worked my whole life and i was an
intelligence officer in the military for
many years working against terrorism and
i thought that was pretty deflammatory
thank you
chair recognizes representative mclaren
to
your left up in the gallery well
gentlemen yield
sure
speaking to this civil cause of action
that we've been discussing
i'm concerned a little bit about
what might be some vagueness in this
language
which you know over the last couple
years i've been a little concerned about
how easy it is to get some lawsuits in
situations where we might not want them
so i guess my question is
first
what is what are an officer's civil
rights is there a definition for that
anywhere because
could that mean any insult to an officer
they could sue for
i don't think it would mean any insult
but i think it goes to a certain degree
and
to be very honest you know this i didn't
write this
this was an amendment that came over
from the senate i'm trying to defend my
part of the bill that
that
deals with a lot of other issues that i
thought were very beneficial
jim and yield for one final question
sure just regarding the other part of
this civil action that i was trying to
draw attention to it says any person
group of persons organization or
corporation
but i don't see any language regarding
causality trying to connect those groups
to the injury and so i guess my concern
is
if an employer gives a group of people
day off from work to go participate in a
protest and somebody does something dumb
can you just file a lawsuit against
every group that that person is
affiliated with
i wouldn't think so but you're the
lawyer
i guess it's an open question thank you
chair recognizes um representative
stovall
in room 341.
that's the gentleman yield
are you
uh is it not true that the legislators
should have been included in this bill
for
for the votes that we might take at the
legislative
general assembly
that may be offensive to others
uh just as i said a minute ago i didn't
write this bill i'm dealing with what uh
with what i was handed
my i certainly understand your concern
but i don't have the ability
to deal with that
thank you
chair recognizes
i think i've had enough mr speaker
okay one more
one more
yes sir okay
i'm glad you said one more because
the chair recognizes the majority leader
of the house leader burns to your right
for a question
gentlemen yield
mr chairman it's always amazing to me
when you uh and i've heard it several
times and to be quite frank and honest
about it it's always amazing to me for
your life experiences that you've been
through
in your career as a public servant
in public safety in the situations that
you um have encountered
and is it not true
mr chairman that you've always treated
everyone that you've encountered
on the road or in this in this body
wherever the situation may be in
leadership roles with respect and that's
what you've demanded of the public
safety officers that you've
commanded over the years i like to think
that you know i had great hesitation
when i was asked to run for this slot
because uh i worked 20 years on the road
in in my hometown area and uh
i run into people every day who i gave
citations to uh 50 years ago and
nobody likes it nobody likes to get a
citation of any type i mean i've talked
to psychologists i've got a grandson
that's a psychiatrist and
it's just inherent that
you know you don't like to be accused of
something and when it's open for
discussion like many of the things law
enforcement officers do
uh they tell me they weren't guilty but
i gave them a ticket anyway and and uh
our philosophy has always been if
there's any doubt
let them go
uh
gentlemen yield for another question
sure
you've been
you've been thoroughly cross-examined
from the legal perspective of what about
civil causes of action
but but i would um ask you have you have
you ever
in your home on the property that you
and your wife your wife occupy and that
your children your grandchildren call
home
has your
safety there
ever been threatened because of your
public
service within this house and from your
public safety perspective i've been
threatened both
and i think some of the people in
leadership here know
i had some uh anonymous phone calls last
year about my life with regard to bill
that was in our committee that
didn't come out and then uh several
times during my career had people come
to my house and uh
some of them had firearms and some of
them were slightly intoxicated and
you know it's not it's not an unusual
circumstance for law enforcement
officers to have that occur particularly
if you work in the local area
where you reside and they know who you
are
one more question certainly
mr chairman isn't it true
and i use this catchphrase sometimes at
home
that um
my public safety
my first responders run to danger while
i run away
i think that's a very true statement in
every sense of the word
but mr chairman isn't it true
that these people that work put their
lives on the line to protect us protect
our safety every day
that they deserve the protections
and the appreciation this body can offer
to them but this legislation simply
offers them protections
to help prevent them from being harassed
and intimidated as they do the jobs that
they signed up for
and many times a very low risk return
for their investment in us
protecting we as individuals
and acumen our communities as they're
not tremendous i think that's well
stated and and to be honest uh
uh during my tenure on the state patrol
we had 15 people killed in the line of
duty i i knew every one of them
there were probably 40 or 50 more who
were shot or stabbed one was they tried
to drown him in a ditch if a soldier
hadn't come by and knocked him off
probably would have killed him
uh it's a dangerous job you never know
when it's going to occur
and uh for the pay that they get it just
amazes me that and i think we're about
to see uh
see a real decline in people who want to
be law enforcement officers uh you know
all of us are very uh very aware of of
uh social standing and what goes on in
the communities and what people think of
you and
and certainly everybody enjoys a certain
amount of ego that
they like for the neighbors and their
friends to be appreciative of what they
do and when that stops i think we're
going to have a real difficult time
attracting qualified people and i've
said many times
and it not only occurs in law
enforcement you get what you pay for and
if you don't have high standards and pay
people
sufficiently
you get what's left
thank you for your service to this state
and the people of it mr chairman thank
you thank you
i'm going to abandon the will mr speaker
and
i uh
i appreciate uh
everybody who's sat here and listened to
this it's uh it's been a long
long endeavor for me but i
i hope you'll see fit to uh to vote
for this bill as i think it
is i think it's very positive for our
law enforcement community as well as the
firemen and the others that many people
don't think about many times so
thank you
okay we have some other members i think
had parliamentary inquiries uh
representative jasmine clark did you
wish to be recognized
what purpose do you rise
state your inquiry is it not true that
qualified immunity precludes individuals
or makes it more difficult for
individuals to sue police officers but
that this bill would give the ability
for police officers to sue those people
well that gets into a long legal
discussion i would refer you to
the leader of your caucus or to chairman
fleming or chairman illustration and i
think they could probably
share a lot of
insight with you
what purpose does representative
who's next i can't see with the mask
derrick jackson representative jackson
what purpose do you rise
state your inquiry
mr speaker is it not true after two
decades of serving in the military that
i support and defend
all citizens to include first responders
police peace
and fire department
i believe that to be true
one more inquiry
state your inquiry is it not further
true
that
this bill house bill 838
is not solving
the problems that we are experiencing
today with regards to
social
injustice is that not for the truth
i think that's something that will
address itself to each and every
member's
judgment
thank you for the inquiry
um
representative dreyer
what purpose do you rise
parliamentary state your inquiry
looking at lines um 69 through 72 of
this legislation is it not true that if
an 18 year old happens to key a car of
someone who is a first responder they
will the prosecutor can send them to
prosecutors in jail for five years and
that the data shows us that prosecution
is going to be
harder on african-american
citizens of georgia than on white people
and much more likely to get sent to jail
for a long time
again i think that's something that
addresses itself to the
judgment of each and every member
what purpose does representative
wolinsky rise
he waves off
what purpose does representative abel
mabel thomas rise
thank you mr speaker
is it not true
that in the current
social unrest
and
we are all in this together
where we are trying to find a balance
between
[Music]
not just police brutality or police
misconduct
but systemic
and structural racism in america
that this bill
has already been stated in terms of like
a double
uh qualified immunity
and it is very
um
punitive
and it will actually cause more
harm
than good is that not true mr speaker
i'm sure the lady believes that to be
true
all right thank you mr speaker what
purpose does representative wilkerson
rise
is it not true i speak as not an
attorney but as a father
a father who has seen his son interact
with police officers every day but had
to have a 30-minute conversation with
him because of the social arrest we're
dealing with
a father that is going to see a chamber
with not one african-american vote for
this bill and we are pitting
law enforcement against our citizens
i don't know what to say i love this
chamber i love this body but i have
never been so disappointed in my life
thank you mr speaker
what purpose does um
what purpose does representative reeves
rise
parliamentary inquiry state your inquiry
mr speaker isn't it true that the vast
majority of crimes that are accounted
for in title 16 and other titles
in our code section require just general
intent
but that this bill with the inclusion in
line 63 of the words maliciously
and the term specific intent
is created a much higher burden for the
state to prove intent and that from my
experience this higher burden will be
the difference in
some of the instances that have been
brought up such as
generally keying a car
would separate those things from being
what this bill is intended to cover with
the words malicious and specific intent
i'm sure the gentleman believes that to
be true
that appears to be all of the
parliamentary inquiries
we're going to be at ease for about for
a few minutes before we vote this bill
so i'm going to ask you to
stretch your legs take a restroom break
if you need to
stay close by we'll ring the bell but
before
these individuals i have an unrelated
matter i need to see up at the rostrum

the chair recognizes chairman chuck
estration for a motion
thank you mr speaker i move that the
house agreed to the senate substitute to
house bill 426
chairman illustration has moved that
this house
to the senate substitute to house bill
426
the clerk will read the caption house
bill 426 to be titled inactive men
article 1 chapter 10 is title 17 the
official go to georgia annotated
relating the procedure for sentencing
and imposition of punishment social
advice or criteria for imposition of
punishment for crimes involving bias or
prejudice
the chair recognizes chairman
illustration
to explain the senate substitute
to house bill 426
well thank you mr speaker it's a
wonderful day a historic day here in our
state capitol in the state of georgia as
you've heard me discuss before house
bill 426
is a momentous bill
that addresses a gap that we've had in
georgia law since 2004. georgia is one
of only four states without a hate
crimes law on the books
and as i go through the language that's
incorporated here in the senate bill i
think it's important to begin with the
fact that
georgia's existing law
was used as the framework for this bill
that the major issue
with the existing law was a lack of
specificity in the named protected
classes
that's something that this body did in
march of 2019 when we passed house bill
426 and sent it over to the senate
that bill has now come back and the only
addition to the classes is the class of
sex which you'll see here in the bill
that's one of the three changes that
i'll point out for you
the second major change
is in the applicability of the bill how
this works in the criminal court context
so someone who is charged with a crime
and that's important to note you must be
charged with an underlying criminal
offense for this enhanced sentence to be
available
that person must first be convicted of
the underlying offense and the senate
has specified
that if it is a felony offense or one of
five misdemeanors
that there is an enhanced penalty
available which you'll see here in the
language in the statute
now
this is important because there are
certain crimes that are particularly
heinous
and simply looking at the criminal
offense it doesn't reflect the true
nature of the crime which is not just an
offense against the victim
but it's it very well me may be an
offense against a whole group of victims
or an attack on all of society
and recognition of that within our law
is incredibly important
house bill 426
as amended does also include
a
an additional provision in section 2.
in section 2 there is a
data provision which was
added into the bill
which would allow for the state to
collect necessary data in order to
better determine
these of these types of offenses and the
frequency with which they occur they're
investigated the disposition and such
the
house bill that left this body and went
over to the senate also had a enhanced
penalty for a misdemeanor not a high and
aggravated misdemeanor and that is
removed from the senate version of the
bill
but if i just summarize for you the
three changes it's number one
designating five specific misdemeanors
which will allow for enhanced penalties
removing the
reduced
misdemeanor treatment for
one that isn't one of those fives adding
sex to the protected classes and the
data component in section two
now this wouldn't have been possible
without the great bipartisan cooperation
that we had here in this body the dean
of the house
who i was incredibly proud to work with
who's my friend and who
has been with me throughout this we've
been together throughout this process
the chair of the legislative black
caucus representative bennett
this incredible team that we've had
along with all of our co-sponsors
bipartisan bipartisan co-sponsors to see
this measure through has made this
possible today
but there's no doubt about it we would
not be here without
our speaker of the house
a great leader and a great man
who's dedicated to justice
and unity for the people of georgia so i
want to thank you mr speaker for this
[Music]
[Applause]
as a speaker said this bill just passed
the state senate with an overwhelming
support 47-6
it's time for this house to do again
what we did in march of 2019
and this time to send an overwhelming
vote a strong message that there's no
place for hate in georgia
i urge your support of house bill 426
thank you
what purpose does representative vernon
jones arise
parliamentary inquiries your inquiry mr
speaker isn't it true
that this piece of legislation does not
include in its protective class
people who are assaulted
as a result of a hate crime based on
their party affiliation or their
political ideology
you are absolutely correct it does not
include that isn't it further true mr
speaker that people are actually being
attacked
based on their party affiliation or
their political ideology
across this country
well i'm not aware of people being
attacked i know that we have of our
disagreements and debates from time to
time and and you know i think we've had
those for
well over two centuries now
representative
isn't it true mr speaker that people
have been assaulted
by wearing a political cap
in this country physically assaulted
i
i have not seen anybody be physically
assaulted but they could have been
final parliamentary speech sure
is there true mr speaker that i do have
an amendment that will address people
being attacked primarily because of
their political persuasion affiliation
or political ideology
and that myself
i've also received threats among other
things from people just based on my
freedom of expression
which is one of our constitution which
is a amendment to our constitution
freedom of expression
that if we don't address this now we're
going to come back to this body when
someone gets hurt
on the gentleman's motion at this house
uh i'm sorry
what purpose does representative holly
rise
follow me aren't we state your inquiry
it's not true mr speaker
that with the respect that i have from
my colleague who just spoke
that in light
of the deaths of people who were not
able to be here
that maybe this is not the time to
compare your tragedy because you are not
their martyr is this true sir i'm sure
the gentleman believes that to be true
thank you
on the gentleman's motion
what purpose does rep chairman setzler
rise
parliamentary increments state your
inquiry
isn't it true that when we passed this
bill
last session in march section two is not
a part of this bill mr speaker isn't
that true
what is that
that is correct
uh
isn't it further true mr speaker that
again i appreciate your the deliberation
with which this body has taken things
but section two
just to be clear
it creates a circumstance
where if it appears
that a defendant might have been
selected for one of these
one of these
alleged hate crimes
it requires law enforcement to create a
biased crime report
where
if there is evidence it doesn't mean
that they're convicted doesn't say
there's a preponderance of the evidence
but if evidence exists this biased crime
report
is logged and is maintained
in fact the only thing that requires
this to happen even if law enforcement
does not see it happen isn't it true
that
any offense that's counted
an offense shall be counted for each
incident reported to the police so that
under this bill this is not what we
passed before this bill says that any
incident reported to their police shall
be a separate incident
of a biased crime report this is not
isn't it true mr speaker debated in
committee in this chamber this was added
on by the senate and the posture to take
that out and to pass the clean hate
crimes bill we contemplated earlier is
to vote no on this
and vote on a version that that's more
consistent with what the house passed
before
well you know this is a a process mr
chairman it's a process that involves a
little compromise
and
[Music]
i've seen very few measures go through
here that were not the result of
compromise because everybody brings
different ideas to the table
what purpose does representative
gertler rise
momentary and cory state your inquiry is
not true
that we should not be lowering and
hiring the standard of justice based on
immutable factors such as race ethnicity
and gender
if the gentleman believes that i'm sure
he thinks it's accurate
what purpose does representative frazier
rise state your inquiry mr speaker isn't
it true that
ahmad aubrey's mother miss wonder cooper
jones is watching this session live as
we speak and she supports house bill 426
and i hope that she is watching it
representative
okay
on the gentleman's motion that this
house agree
to the senate substitute house bill 426
all those in favor of the motion will
vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machines and call the
role

while you're taking a moment to look at
the board and be sure it's accurate
you know it occurred to me
[Music]
a day or so ago that there are very few
times that
members of a legislative body
get called upon at a
defining moment in our history
but this is a defining moment for
georgia
it's a moment where in the midst of a
global pandemic and widespread civil
unrest
georgia has a
stood strong
for that which is right
i want to commend the senate for joining
with us in this effort
so many in this body have worked so hard
to see this day get here
two leaders deserve special tribute
chairman chuck f stration
dean calvin smiry
[Music]
i don't know that i've ever seen
the kind of courage and strong
leadership
in shepherding this bill
through the process for more
than 470 days
and gentlemen
your work will leave an enduring legacy
this is a historic moment and i am
beyond proud that this house is acted in
a bold
bipartisan manner
so that today we can all stand together
today we have said that we will not be
defined
by a senseless act of evil
and by the murder of a mod arberry
but that our georgia is better than this
