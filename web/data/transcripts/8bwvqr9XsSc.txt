I pledge to the Georgia flag to the principals for which it stands with the Justice, moderation, and courage. Well, good morning. I think you will. I'm excited. I have a friend for 30 years. It's been speaking and talking about our godly heritage. And I believe that he's going to share some things with you today that probably you didn't know about things I didn't know about. But David Martin is the founder of Wal-Builders Ministries, a national organization, highlighting America's true history and biblical foundation. Best selling author, nationally recognized speaker. He's widely sold after for his expertise in historical and constitutional issues. His extensive collection of original founding era documents and decades of research had made him a trusted resource to legislators, educators, and medias nationally. David and his wife Cheryl reside in Texas and enjoy their family with three grown children and six grandchildren. I encourage you if you get a chance. In the rotunda for today is their pop-up museum. And the items down there are personal items of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, some of the first Bibles printed in the nation, and actually a copy of one of the first drafts of the Constitution. So you may want to take a look at that. But with that, I'm honored to introduce to you David Martin. Thank you, Senator. Good morning, Senators. In opening with prayer this morning, I want to go back for a little bit to some of George's beginnings. And in doing so, I want to show you a document here. This is original. This is from 1732. This is your birth certificate. This is the act by King George II that authorized George. He gave 10,000 pounds to start the colony of George. So this is actually the beginning of where this colony starts. And you originally had three chaplains here. One was George Whitfield, one was Charles Wesley, and one was John Wesley. All three of those chaplains, indisputably, had a huge impact, not just on Georgia, but on the nation. George Whitfield, particularly founding fathers, pointed to George Whitfield and what he did is the reason that we have a nation. He's without Whitfield and what he did across the years being chaplain here, but also across America. He's the guy who laid the foundation for the nation. So I brought with me two works, original by George Whitfield. This is a sermon he preached his chaplain. We here arrived here in Georgia. This is the first sermon preached in America. And then after he had been here for a few years, he went back to talk to the king about what was going in Georgia. And this is a sermon that he preached when he got back to England to say, hey, here's what's going in Georgia. So it's kind of early history of Georgia in some ways. In addition to that, there's works by other chaplains. These are works by Charles Wesley, one of your other first three original chaplains. In addition to these works by Charles Wesley, there's John Wesley right here. Other items that you may find of interest related to your history and heritage is your three signers in the Declaration of Independence, Fudden Gwinnett, Lime and Hall, and George Walton. We have documents from all of them. I brought some of George Walton's documents here when he was serving as governor of Georgia. These are early documents from your history here. And in addition to that, you started your first constitution. This is the Georgia Constitution, 1777 written by Button Gwinnett. So this is your original first constitution. It's quite amazing. It's interesting, even the motto that was for the state back then, is God has bestowed all these blessings upon us. So that was your original motto in 1777. A few decades later, we get into the signers of the constitution. And of course, you have with that William Fue and Abraham Baldwin. We have documents up here from both Fue and Baldwin, if you're interested in seeing those afterwards. So let me open with prayer. And I want to open the prayer by choosing three prayers that were prayed by the previous chaplains here, your original chaplains. So let me begin with the prayer from Charles Wesley. This prayer is spirit of Heavenly Council come, teach our senators thy will. Father, let us that ask receive. To us that ask in Jesus' name thou shalt thy spirit give. O send us now the promised comforter. Father, everyone that asks receives, receives the gift and the giver too, and witnesses that thou art true. So shall we pray and never cease. So shall we thankfully confess thy wisdom, truth, power and love. And here's a prayer from your chaplain John Wesley. Does God command us to pray without ceasing? Prayer is lifting up of the heart to God. Prayer thou attempt us to pray, see that it be thou one design to commune with God, to lift up thy heart to him, to pour out thy soul before him. We pray that we may do the whole will of God as he willeth and the man that pleases him. And may we do it because it is his will. Let this be the whole and the only motive of whatsoever we think or whatsoever we speak or whatsoever we do. And finally, a prayer from George Woodfield. He says in a glect of prayer, his frequently been an inlet to many spiritual diseases and has always been attended with fatal consequences. Praying always says the apostle with all manner of supplication. Watching praise as our Lord that you enter not into temptation. He intends that our souls should be kept in praying frame. Prayer brings and keeps God and man together. No believers pray, pray without ceasing. When you're about the common business of life, be much in prayer. Prayer will reach the very heart of God and return to you again loaded with spiritual blessings. And I'll close by adding in my prayer, Lord, we thank you for all the blessings you've bestowed hereupon Georgia and its leaders. May the prayers prayed over this state for the past three centuries be heard today, Lord. We ask this in your name, amen. Thank you. No, you're not. Yes. Today, I always like to recognize our doctors of the day and our doctor of the day is from making Georgia. Lizzie and for Cy thanks, Jason Bacon. And I'll have the proteam introduce her to this body and probably need to turn this down just a little bit here. I recognize the senator from the 20th. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. President. It's my pleasure to date, introduce Dr. Ranna Manna, who is our doctor of the day. She began medical school at the age of 45 at Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon and completed her internal medicine residency at the Atlanta Medical Center. Then began private practice in Macon, Georgia. She specializes in health, wellness and fitness, encouraging her patients to lose weight and get fit in order to control hypertension and adult onset diabetes instead of prescribing medication when possible. She's been very active in the Macon community with a series of health seminars called a Better You. She was president of the Bibb County Medical Society in 2013 and continues to serve on that board. She's an annual delegate to the Medical Association of Georgia House of Delegates and she is on the faculty at Mercer University School of Medicine and mentors medical students. We're proud to have her as our doctor for the day. She does this annually for us and we appreciate her dedicating her time to do that.

One of her proudest accomplishments is her son Christian who is now retired from the United States Marine Force. Her husband Joseph Eglow is a cattle farmer who operates Rocking Chair Ranch cattle providing grass fed beef to several Georgia restaurants and stores. He also operates Mid-South Packers, a beef processing facility in Monroe County and I appreciate her being with us today. Introduce Dr. Mona. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me today. I love this day more than any other because never in our doctor's lives do we get thanked for our service like we do when we come here. So it is my joy and honor to serve you today to help you with your health and wellness to answer any medical questions that you might have. And I let them tell my story about medical school starting late in life at age 45 simply because there's always somebody in the audience who thinks it's too late to do something. Trust me if it's important do it. Thank you. Good job, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Does any Senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege? No one today. Senator from the 14th.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. My distinguished colleagues, I rise today to recognize Black History Month. Black History Month is about recognizing and celebrating the people and stories that help shape the state of Georgia and this nation. Let me be clear. Black History is not separate from Georgia history. It runs alongside it. It's woven into its foundation. Georgia has been home to leaders who challenged America to live up to its highest ideals. Martin Luther King, Jr. raised in Atlanta, showed the world a power of courage, face, and nonviolence. John Lewis reminded us that democracy is never guaranteed. Andrew Young, also the ambassador, let us know that it is attainable only with ordinary people. People show extraordinary participation and courage. But Black History is also made up of countless names that never appear in textbooks. Teachers, laborers, parents, small business owners, men and women who showed up for one another and worked every day to build communities, strengthen families, and help create a nation that could endure. African Americans in Georgia played a fundamental role in building communities, institutions, and movements that shaped this state. Schools, churches, businesses, and civic organizations rose because of their vision, sacrifice, and determination. The work that did not just benefit one community, it strengthened Georgia as a whole, this nation as a whole. And that legacy still matters today. Black History is not only about the past. It's about the responsibility we carry in the present. It's about continuing that legacy, shaping leadership, expanding opportunities, and the future. Building opportunities where everyone has a chance to thrive. As a Black Senator, as a Senator kissed by the sun serving in this Georgia legislature, I carry that legacy with me every day. Representation is more than a title. It's an obligation. It's an obligation to listen carefully and obligation to pass thoughtful legislation and obligation to open doors and expand opportunities for all people we serve. And that's how we are, those who came before us, not only with words, but with action. And as we celebrate, heart day to day, American heart. I think it ironic, and I will bring up one other person. When I visited Howard University, I lived in a place called Drew Hall. And I asked the question, where did this name come from? Drew Hall came from this guy, a great African American physician, who lived from 1904 to 1950. He was the one that developed this thing called plasma that allows all of us to live, to store a blood. He was the one that developed ways to process and store blood plasma and blood banks. He directed the blood plasma program of the United States and Great Britain in World War II. And he was the one who resigned from that position after a ruling that the blood of African Americans would be segregated from those of other persons. He died in April 1st, 1950. And tragically because of an alchemy accident, because of a lack of blood. The man that we celebrate because he allowed us to give blood for life, but he left this world without having the very thing that he died to help develop. That is the story. The story even goes further to say that he was denied admission at a white hospital, but that's controversial. But the bottom line is, we celebrate Black History because it is the American story. It is a story that we've learned to live together because we refuse to die as fools. God bless you. Let's celebrate Black History. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. I recognize the Senator from the 43rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues.

Day is Black Women in Film Day at the Georgia State Capitol. And I will highlight that the first black woman to start in a major motion picture is Josephine Baker, who is widely known for playing the lead role in the 1927 French silent film, Siren of the Tropics. While she holds this distinction in international cinema, other pioneers in the 1920s include actresses, Evelyn Preer, and race films, and filmmakers like Maria P. Williams. Maria P. Williams is widely recognized as the first black woman to write, produce, and act in her own film, The Flames of Wrath in 1923. As a pioneer in early cinema, she established the Western film producing company in Kansas City. Iconic Black Women movie characters include pioneers like Dorothy Dandridge, and Gone with the Wind, groundbreaking figures like Wobby Goldberg in the Color Purple, action heroes such as Pam Greer and Foxy Brown, powerful portrayals by Angela Bassett and what's love got to do with it. And our modern iconic icons like L'Obita, Young Goh, Black Panther, and Octavia Spencer in Hidden Figures, showcasing strength, resilience, and diversity across genres and eras. Thank you to the generations of Black women who came before us to lead the way and blazed trails for many others to pursue their dreams in film. Again, today we recognize what every day we celebrate Black women in film. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the will. I pose for my picture too. Senator from the 33rd for a purpose you rise. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 28th for business outside the Capitol. Well, objection to the senator from 28th is excused. Recognize the senator from 29th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, colleagues. You know, a lot of times we make light of when we get ready to come down here, people will say, what are you doing at L'Anna this year? And you say, well, we'll go down there and do God's work. And we like to talk about God and a lot of other things. But I want to talk about somebody named Cornelius Taylor. Little over a year ago, Cornelius Taylor was living here in Atlanta, if you want to call it that, in an alley, within the shadows of, without a doubt, the most iconic church in the United States of America. And probably the second most iconic house of worship in the world. And he was killed accidentally while the city of Atlanta was clearing the homeless encampment. And the city and the mayor and everybody called a whole lot of grief about it. And everybody was coming out of the woodwork looking for somebody to blame. That a man who was homeless living within the shadows of a house of worship had died. And I'm not casting dispersions upon that particular house of worship. I'm challenging every house of worship, every congregation. The men and women of faith who come down to this building and ask us for state funds to help them solve problems that they're not even asking their own congregation to take care of. My faith in the Bible that I read out of tells me it is the church's responsibility. Not the bricks and mortar in the stained glass windows, but the congregation inside those. Whether you're in a church, whether you're in a mosque, whether you're in a temple, whether you're in any other faith, it is your responsibility to stand up and go out and take care of those less fortunate. Those that find themselves trapped in a place that they cannot get out of, whether it's because of poverty, whether it's because of addiction or no matter the cause. So where was the church that day? Where was the church when he started struggling? Where was the church when he ended up where he ended up? We know where they were afterwards. Churches have focused on themselves for too long. Congregations within those churches have focused on themselves for too long. We see all of it on television. We see all of it on live stream. Churches are a place where we go to pick up the weapons we need to go out and fight the battle that we are called to fight. And that is the battle to go out there and take care of the widows and the orphans and those trapped in poverty. Those who struggle with demons that we do not understand. Atlanta has always been known as the city too busy to hate. And I'm not casting dispersions on the city of Atlanta. I'm challenging every city in the state of Georgia. Do not become the city that depends on the government to do your job. And do not become the city that becomes too busy to care. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. I recognize Senator from the 44th for a point in personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Healthcare access is on the line here in Georgia and across America. The government and the government are trying to find insurance. While Republicans in Washington play politics, refusing to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. 200,000 have already lost health insurance in the last month. A million and a half, either lose insurance or see their premiums double or triple in light of Congress throwing Americans under the bus. Here in Georgia, our hospitals can lose 1.6 billion in revenue deepening the dire financial situation that many are already in. With all of the chaos coming from Washington, it's more important than ever for our state government and leaders to step in to defend Georgians. Senate Democrats have proposed solutions to this crisis. SB 379 would create a state-based health insurance affordability program. This program would lower costs for those up to 400% of the federal poverty line and provide free health care for those up to 200%. Georgia Democrats have been fighting for years to expand Medicaid. SB 380 is still the best path forward to ensuring that millions of people can afford to see a doctor. We have got the third highest number of unentered people in the nation and it's getting worse. Here are just a couple recent stories. Teresa Acosta, a single mom of three, saw her premium jump from $80 in December to $520 a month in January. Her son has type 1 diabetes, requires regular care and she's tied in knots and kept up at night wondering how she will be able to continue to get him the health care he needs. A small business owner in D'Lanagha reported that her monthly premium was $97 before the subsidies were removed and now it is instead of $97 a month, it is a whopping $100, $1,100 a month. The solutions are there but Republicans are sitting on their hands trying to pretend that the crisis doesn't exist. This is not a crisis that you can ignore. People understand what is going on when their premiums go up thousands of percent a month. We might hear, wait, we have expanded Medicaid for those who can jump through the hoops that have been laid out. The thing is that the pathways program from the jump has been so purposely contorted with endless paperwork and other requirements that only 6% of those who could have gotten insured have managed to cut through the thicket and get the insurance. Meanwhile that program has wasted tens of millions of dollars to ensure a tiny fraction of people. Only 30% of the money has actually gone to patient care or to doctors. 70% has gone to administrative expenses. So essentially it became, it has become, a jobs program for paper pushers and what is the point in that. We should have expanded Medicaid a dozen years ago where we could have insured a whole lot more people at a lot lower cost. There are Republicans in Washington just added a work requirement and they still pay 90%. So what is the objection now? I suggest that Georgia Republicans are not yet willing to admit that pathways has been a failure. We have been told that access has been a great success and we don't clean up Washington's messes. This is left, Georgians asking if it is not the responsibility of Republicans in Washington to fix this crisis and it is not the responsibility of Republicans in Georgia to fix it, then who? Who? Who is going to lead on this problem and fix it and lower costs for Georgians? I would suggest to you that it is going to have to be Democrats. Democrats have always led on healthcare, Democrats created Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. It is clear to Georgians that Democratic leadership is needed on this issue once again. Thank you. I yield the vote. We are going to add as a senator from the 35th point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, everyone. I am going to read an excerpt from a book of a hero of mine and I want to see if you will be able to guess who this person is. Hint, this person is deeply connected to Martin Luther King, Jr. I am going to read this portion of the introduction. As I read this, I want you to imagine if somebody had to write a book about your life, what kind of words, what kind of phrases would they use? But I want you to just listen into what somebody had to say. I unabashedly revere this person for his genuine contributions, his strength of character, his courage of mind, vision, and ability to grow and courage to change. Creative relentlessness and restlessness exist for life. His stubborn moral courage, prophetic imagination, and deep commitment to social justice, boundless energy, and eagerness to tackle new tasks, devotion to academic excellence, capacity for independence of thought, and critical judgment. Single-minded commitment to the most precious and enduring values of the human enterprise, and a lifelong romance with the world of higher possibilities. He is a wise man. His spirit is indomitable. His will is inexhaustible. This is about Benjamin Elijah Mays. I happen to be a graduate of Benjamin Elijah Mays High School, class of 99 in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia, a revered educator, led Morehouse College for many decades, and a famous preacher's kid was bent on not going into the ministry because didn't have the vision of what ministry can look like for his life. And Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays took of Martin Luther King Jr. and said, imagine ministry looking a little different than what your daddy did. His black history month, and it feels appropriate to highlight some heroes that walked these same streets as we do. And I just hope that we also could have a lifelong romance with the world of higher possibilities. Walk into the capital. We have a homelessness problem. We know it's easy to point fingers on who should be doing what and when. But imagine a romance with the world of higher possibilities says, well, what can I do? Many of us in here are in here with the pure heart. At least we hope we have a pure heart. But I want us to really think about what's our lifelong romance consist of? Do we imagine a world of possibilities? Or are we stuck in this is just the way it's been? Thank God for those men and women over the centuries who've decided to think about what our world could be. I yield the will. I yield the will. I yield the will. I yield the will. Thank you, Mr. President. My friends, it was a blessing this morning to have David Barton here and explain history. But as he was talking, I thought how fitting that he would mention Joseph Whitefield, one of Georgia's founders. See, that's where I'm from, is Whitfield County, named after Joseph Whitefield. I love the history. Yes, there was a change in the spelling from Whitfield to Whitfield. But I've always been proud to be from North Georgia. See, we are unique in the fact that we are the, you hear often here, the rust belt and the other states. We are the manufacturing district of Georgia. And I'm just very proud of what we do, whether you be from Whitfield County or Murray County or Gordon County. We are the four covering capital of the world. And I'm very proud to stay in here before you. Each year we have Dalton has their Dalton day. And today I come to the well. Because proudly to tell you today is Dalton day. And we invite each and every one of you to come down the freight depot at four o'clock this afternoon so that because you know, as I say every year and you get a rug and you get a rug and you get a rug. But being that this is the 250th anniversary of our state and of our nation, I am proud to display this year's Dalton day rug. And it's... And so everybody is welcome to come down and four o'clock this afternoon we'd love to have you and meet and understand why Northwest Georgia is such a great part of our state. It would be my honor, Mr. President, to give you the first round of the day. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that senator. We do appreciate good folks at Dalton. Dalton George always provides us with these rugs and then we appreciate the industry and what it provides for us for the state economy as well. So thank you senator. I appreciate that very much and I know everybody be happy to see you coming today. So I reckon I'll send it from 36. Thank you Mr. President, colleagues. I rise today. We've done our red many of us this morning to wear to the Capitol to signal our support for the American Heart Association and for heart health and we're wearing red today because of that. We can do a little bit more. That's the good news. And a lot more needs to be done. You know, unfortunately over there at the CDC that tobacco cessation programs were shut down that were accomplishing something and making a difference. Programs were shuttered and staff were let go and that remains an issue before us is to be sure that they're back in business doing tobacco cessation. There's a bill that we can support, House Bill 506 to help people quit tobacco. Now I'm not speaking in the abstract. I'm a former smoker. My daddy was a lifetime smoker and the smoking damage is heart and we lost him when he was still in his late 60s. Just had retired and wanted to enjoy a nice retirement but that was not to be thanks to lifelong use of tobacco. I was smoking when I came to the legislature. I went through the battles of smoking. We started smoking behind the bleachers in high school at cheerleading practice. And that's where the habit gets built is in very young people who make a lot of less than smart decisions. And the next thing you know, they're hooked on tobacco. Smokeenders was the riveting for me. But one year in the legislature and that was my last cigarette April of 1987. Right now we can provide a great assist to people in Georgia who need help to quit smoking. And the good news is it's not only a life saver, it's a money saver at the same time. The Medicaid population is more than twice as likely to be smokers than those that are on private insurance. Georgia spends $699 million annually on Medicaid costs related to tobacco use. If 1% of the Medicaid population quit smoking, it would save Georgia $38 million the very next fiscal year. These are compelling numbers, aren't they? Right now we've got barriers for tobacco cessation programs for those who need it most. And that's what House Bill 506 would do. House Bill 506 would remove barriers, create a level access to smoking cessation, no matter what your coverage is, whether it's Georgia Medicaid, fee for service or managed care. We need to bring parity between all of these programs. And with the primary goal of getting more people access to smoking cessation, it works. And smoking was my pathway. There are many programs. But right now, increasingly there are meds that you can take as well. But counseling is an individual group counseling. Very valuable. The point is, we have a structure right now that's not working to maximize the benefits of smoking cessation. And I would dare say most of us are unaware of that fact. House Bill 506 gives us an opportunity to do the smart thing, save money, save lives, and really give a second life to those who have been caught up in the dreadful addiction to smoking and tobacco use. Thank you for your attention to this. I say while we wear our red today, let us then stand together, party considerations aside, and pass HB506 to remove the barriers to tobacco cessation that are there currently in our system. Thank you very much for your attention. I yield the will. We're going to ask the senator from first. Thank you, Mr. President. Just a clear point, so clarification. So the chaplain was talking about Reverend Whitfield in Savannah, Georgia, and the senator from the 54th was talking about Whitfield County. I'm not sure they're the same, but Whitfield in Savannah is spelled W-H-I-T-E-F-I-E-L-D. And we pronounce it as he pronounced it, Whitfield, and he was the clergy from the church that I go to, Christ Church. Other points of clarification have to do with the state of health care in the state of Georgia. So, let's just talk about the very successful waiver that we did that's called Access. We did that under Governor Kim's first two bills carried by the senator from the 19th, I believe, and appropriations chair at the time he was the governor's floor leader, and that's called Access. And that's 100% up to 400% of the federal poverty line. So basically, just over $17,000 for a single person and up to $70,000 for a single person in the 400% federal poverty level line. A great success over 700,000 people, states the Abrams estimated there were 400,000, and it was 700,000 actually. A great number covered under Obamacare. And Obamacare is what we're at right now. Under the emergency health orders under President Biden, folks were paying zero. And I just think that's wrong. Personally I think even a person with at 101% of federal poverty levels should pay something. I think we all should have skin in the game because health care is not free. Hospitals pay mortgages, hospitals pay bonds. Health care workers have mortgages. The point I was making is that the max under Obamacare that anyone could pay for their premium in access was 8.1%. And yes, it has gone up to 8.2% the max. So 8.2% make Ms. President, 8.2% of your salary, of your income. So basically the $70,000 person at the 400% level would pay $478 a month. I think it's important to have health care. I think that is important to carry. Within the last I will just discuss real quickly 100% on down, which is called pathways, hopefully out of poverty because you should not want to earn $16,000 a year and stay in poverty. But you are afforded Medicaid and that is what is done. Of course, the Ms. Nomear of Work is what the press uses and the other side of the aisle uses relating to the work requirements. Let's talk about that. Work requirements, 20 hours a week of work or 20 hours of volunteer work, go to the YMCA and cut the grass or go to vocational technical school or go to college. And we just put in a waiver that if you have a six year old child, then you would be eligible also. But what was done in the one big beautiful bill took that up to 13 years old and that's what we'll be going to also. Again, we are an example for the nation. Those that did do Medicaid explosion, I mean expansion, that's what they'll be doing also. Thank you very much. I yield the well. We're going to have Senator from the 41st. As for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 22nd. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Madam Jackson, Senator from 22nd is excused. Does any other senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? Do you have a consent calendar or privilege resolutions? Does any senator wish to remove?

of a resolution from the consent calendar. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair, here's none. The resolution's only consent calendar are adopted. Are there any motions to withdraw or commit? All right. All right. We are going in a different order today. We have time to consider the confirmation of the government's appointment to the judicial qualifications commission. The Honorable Richard Hines, Secretary Reed DeCampson. Mr. President, does any committee on assignments have had under consideration the following appointment to the judicial qualifications commission? Mr. Richard Hines, the committee on assignments has had under the commission, Mr. Richard Hines, appointed by the governor. And has instructed me to report the same back to the Senate with the following recommendation that the appointments be confirmed as submitted, respectfully submitted, the Honorable Bert Jones, Chairman. Mr. President, that completes the order. I recognize the majority leader. Mr. President, I move that the appointment of the Honorable Richard Hines to the judicial qualifications commission be confirmed as submitted. The majority of the leader has moved that the confirmation of the Honorable Richard Hines to the judicial qualifications commission. The Honorable Richard Hines to the judicial qualifications commission be confirmed as submitted. The Honorable Richard Hines to the judicial qualifications commission be accepted without objection. Is there objection? Senator, would you like to speak to your motion? Senator Ways, is there objection to the motion? All those in favor of the majority leader's motion will vote the yay switch. All those opposed? No. Secretary? I hope you did. Thank you. All the confirmation of the jqc appointment, the yay's are 48, the nay's are zero, and this motion has prevailed. Mr. President, I ask you to consent that the following bills be in gross. That's B403 and HB414. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 403 by senators, Kurt Patrick of the 32nd and others. A bill to be entitled to an act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44 of the OCGA relating to disposition of unclaimed property so as to provide for exceptions to when property is presumed abandoned, to provide for abandonment and liquidation of virtual currency to authorize to lay a publication of notice on the Georgia unclaimed property list, under certain circumstances, to provide for methods of payment of claims, to waive the requirement of appropriate court order for claims of errors under circumstances and for other purposes. House Bill 414 by Representative Jones of the 25th and others. A bill to be entitled to an act to amend Chapter 5 of Title 21 of the official code of Georgia annotated, relating to government transparency and campaign finance so as to revise the definition of person to include certain non-residents of the state to provide the state ethics commission with supplementary, investigatory powers related persons documents or information located outside the state to revise venue provisions to address out of state persons to provide for related matters to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. The majority later has moved is the objection. We got an objection from the senator from the second and the senator from the 41st. I thought we were all going to get along today. All right. Would you like to speak to your motion, senator? Senator Ways, may my light speak in opposition? All right. We'll just put it on the board. All those in favor of the motion will vote, yay, all opposed nay. Secretary in line to the machine. Thank you. All in motion of engrossment, the yeas are 29 and the nays are 20 and this motion has prevailed. All in motion. Thank you. All in motion. All in motion. The committee of the senate on rules recommend that this do pass by substitute senator brass of the 6th chairman. The senate committee on rules offers the following substitute to SB 239. A bill to be entitled to enact to amend article 1 of chapter 18 of title 43 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to funeral directors and establishment and bombers and to remove the requirement that funeral directors be licensed and bombers to revise definitions to revise and for other purposes. Mr. President, that could be zero. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, gentlemen, I ask for your favorable consideration for a senate bill here. This splits a license of funeral directors and embombers. It does not dilute requirements for licensure or need the part. It just splits a license. This would allow an out of state couple that would move to Georgia and one of the spouses happens to be a licensed funeral director in another state. Thank you, Mr. President. This allows people moving into our state to be productive and go to work as a funeral director here in Georgia. Right now, every state that touches Georgia has split license. This is this way in 26 states. For instance, if a couple move to Georgia and one of the people happens to be a licensed funeral director in a neighboring state, they would not be able to get licensed in Georgia because of Georgia in order to be a funeral director. This is kind of outdated, especially when more people are being cremated today and less embombing taking place. So this is just a very simple bill. It will allow people to be productive and get a job, go to work here in the great state of Georgia. Big land, take any questions, Mr. President. You do have a few questions, Senator. Recognize, Senator, from the 13th. You? I do. Senator, are you an expert on embombing and funerals? I would think so after 54 years. I'm glad you said 54 years. Just strengthening into my question. I read your bill and I've voted for your bill and I support your bill, but I'm a little concerned about confused about your bill. It says no less than 15 times in your bill, dead human bodies. Now, do you all work on live humans? No, sir, we're done. Is there a reason it takes 300 and 3,120 hours and 18 months to figure out that they got to be dead human bodies? No, it just figures out what to do with them. There we go. So the situation is this simple. You teach them you can only work on dead human bodies. That is correct. Senator, I yield. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Mr. President, there's no other questions I'll yield the oil. I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. The senator has yielded. Would any other senator wish to speak forward against the measure? Senator from the 33rd? Yes, Senator. Is the senator yielded? Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. Is the previous question is ordered? The question is on the adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Here you're none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the report of committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor? We'll vote ye. I'll oppose nay. Secretary, I'll not the machine. Thank you. Thank you. On the pass of the bill, the a's are 50 and the a's are zero. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there for pass by substitute? All right. Senate bill 403. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 403 by senator Kirkpatrick of the 32nd and others. A bill to be entitled and act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44 of the OCGA, related to disposition of unclaimed property so as to provide for exceptions to when property is presumed abandoned. To provide for abandonment and liquidation of virtual currency to authorize delay of publication of notice on the Georgia unclaimed property list under circumstances. To provide for methods of payment of claims to waive the requirement of appropriate court order for claims of a's under certain circumstances. To provide for circumstances under which a claim is void. To provide for definitions to amend Title 48 of the OCGA, related to revenue and taxation so as to waive confidentiality of certain tax records. To provide for related matters to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President. The Senate Committee on Finance recommends that this bill do pass by substitute by senator Huffstettler of the 52nd Chairman. Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee offers the following substitute to SB403. A bill to be entitled and act to amend Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44 of the official code of Georgia annotated, related to disposition of unclaimed property so as to provide for exceptions to when property is presumed abandoned. To provide for abandonment and liquidation of virtual currency and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I'll break it down to the Senate for a 30 second. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill deals with unclaimed property held by our State Department of Revenue. This is an agency bill that I've been working on for several months after I sort of accidentally found out that I had a small amount of unclaimed property. Subsequent to that, I found out that there's currently $3.3 billion in the custody of the State that's unclaimed property. And these properties end up there for different reasons. Maybe an inheritance issue, it could be an insurance policy or a forgotten bank account. Many Georgians are not aware that they have unclaimed property and the current process for getting it from the Department is cumbersome. I'm guessing each of you has constituents who have unclaimed property who don't even know to ask. Since I presented this bill in committee, a number of people have told me that they found unclaimed property in varying amounts on the DOR website, and I expect that website to get very busy. The goal of this bill is to return more money to Georgians faster with fewer forms, less costs, and fewer administrative barriers. This bill does the following. It establishes an exact match program to automatically return small amounts of unclaimed property to owners using tax records, no claim form required. It allows virtual currency to be legally reported and remitted as unclaimed property. It streamlines air claims by allowing smallest states to be paid using a smallest state affidavit instead of probate. It requires stronger holder outreach before properties turn over to DOR helping to return the money before it ever becomes unclaimed property. It allows the state to permanently take ownership of very small or long abandoned unclaimed property and we're talking about 25 years. Improves timing and accuracy of the Georgia unclaimed property list by allowing delayed publication until the property is actually received by the state. I will help get money back to Georgia citizens and I appreciate the cooperation of the Department of Revenue and the Governor's Office on this agency bill to help our constituents. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions and want to ask for your favorable consideration. You have no question, Senator. Thank you, are you? Does any other senator which speak for against a measure? Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none of the previous questions ordered. The question is only adopted another committee substitute is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Here, you're not on the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the report committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here's none of the board of committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered. Chair here's none in the main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of the bill vote. Yay, I'll pose nay, Secretary, and lock the machine. You You You Strongly Thank you. Own the passes of the bill. Yays are 50, the Nays are 0, and this bill has seen reexit constitutional majority is therefore pass by substitute. Secretary, please read House bill 414. House Bill 414 by Representative Jones at the 25th and others a bill to be entitled an act to amend chapter 5 of Title 21 of the official code of Georgia and of Title 21 of the official Code of Georgia annotated, relating to government transparency and campaign finance. So as to revise the definition of person to include to certain non-residents of the state to provide the state ethics commission with supplementary investigatory powers related to persons, documents, or information located outside the state to revise venue provisions to address out of state persons to revive related matters to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. The committee of the House on Information. The committee of the Senate on ethics recommends that this bill do pass by substitute Senator Watson of the first chairman. Mr. President, the Senate committee on ethics offers the following substitute to House Bill 414. It will be entitled an act to amend Chapter 5 of Title 21 of the official Code of Georgia annotated. Related to government transparency and campaign finance. So as to revise the definition of person to include certain non-residents of the state to provide time periods for responding to civil actions brought by the Attorney General, pursuing to this chapter to revive for a ward of default judgments in such actions and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Break it down, Senator from 25. I apologize as the Senate from the 29th. They wrote the 25th on my paper, Senator. This is a simple mistake. Our hair is exact same color. Colleagues, HB414, very simple piece of legislation crafted by Representative Jones Mover in the House. All it does, if you heard the reading of the preamble, is it holds those out of state to the same rules and regulations when it comes to elections as we're held to. And colleagues, I hope you all know what Monday is. Monday is the last day to get your disclosure in. It'll be looked at to make sure it's transparent. It'll be reviewed to make sure everything is right. And if it's not, there'll be sanctions and ramifications because of our failures. All we are attempting to do in HB414 is to hold those outside of the state of Georgia who choose to participate in our elections through campaign contributions to the same standard. It gives our friends and state ethics the opportunity to subpoena someone outside of the state. It gives them 30 days to respond and the jurisdiction of that case will be here in Fulton County. It is what we refer to many times as the long arm of the law. It gives them the opportunity to go outside of our state and address individuals who choose to come into our state with their money or their influence. The bill went through committee senate ethics committee with a lot of friendly conversation, suggestions, and passed out bipartisan. And with that Mr. President, I'll yield for any questions. You do have a couple questions Senator. I'll recognize them from 26. Thank you Mr. President, for the gentleman here. I absolutely will yield for my friend from Macon. To explanation of the bill does not seem to be what the bill is asking, what are you looking for? If you do campaign disclosure you got put where the money comes from and the address where you got it from. And if you do not have the money you got, you have to give money to state senator Randy Robertson. And they do not provide all the information or I do not provide all the information about the individuals that I receive those contributions from. And if it raises the intent or the concerns of the Georgia Department of Ethics, then they have the opportunity to send us a pina outside of the state. And if you say that money comes from Florida, they are able to send us a pina down to this contributor in Florida and ask them, I wish it was about water, it's just about me. And ask them to come to Fulton County and give an explanation of who they are if they are allowed to participate in this. What it is, there's a lot of people giving a very little bit of information about campaign contributions who want to come into Georgia and influence our elections. We've seen it happen year after year after year after year and all we are attempting to do is hold those out of state actors to the exact standard that we are held to within the state of Georgia. Gentlemen, further you? Absolutely. It seems as though you kind of contradict in yourself, I mean, we get money like from publics. That's how the leak, leak through Florida. They absolutely are. And when you put down the domination of the amount of money you got, you also have to put the address where it came from. That's right. So what is the rationale for this build when on your campaign disclosure, when you put the money in that you receive, you also had to put the address of what had money came from. Senator, I've explained the rationale twice. Well, I'll explain to you once again, is there a bad actress who choose to influence Georgia elections? And they do it through nefarious ways. And it gives the ethics should concern rise to that standard, the opportunity to subpoena those individuals and to come in here. Because I'm sure as you know, there are people that will use other avenues. Now the contributor that you're discussing out of Lake, Florida, I believe in the past, they have actually contributed to my campaign. And what I have provided in my disclosure is every bit of the details of that individual, not just an address in some cases, other things along with copies of the checks and to make sure they have copies of my W9s or whatever else they need. So we're just holding people outside of the state to the same standards because the example you gave is a good actor. This is to go after those who choose not to be good actors. That is why we refer to it as the long arm of the law so that we're able to reach out and prevent people outside of the state of Georgia from having undue influence in the state of Georgia while attempting to hide their identities. We're going to have a senator from the 20th. Thank you, Mr. President, Senator Yill. Yes, sir, I yield to the President Pro Temp. So when we file our campaign disclosure reports by midnight on Monday, we're held to a standard, a high standard of transparency and compliance with the State Ethics Commission. Is that correct? The gentleman knows of which he speaks. And this simply gives the State Ethics Commission the tools to hold out of state entities that are participating in Georgia elections to the same standard that we are held.

in the citizens of Georgia are held to. It gives them a tool to hopefully do that rather than having to rely on the goodwill, I guess, of a attorney general or a DA or something in another state. It gives them a legal tool to file a subpoena here in the state of Georgia on an out of state entity and then turn that subpoena over to that state, you know, like state of Florida, for example, have a subpoena issued in another state as my understanding. Is that correct? It absolutely does that. We have had many of our colleagues in the house and over in the Senate at times run a foul of ethics because of unintended mistakes on disclosures. And our friends correct the mistake, pay the fine and move forward. And all we are doing is making sure that those who are outside the state of Georgia are held to the exact same standard as we are. Myself, so concerned about my disclosure every time, I've hired someone who's an expert to do all of my deposits and do all of my disclosures because I appreciate the ethical hammer that is above all of our heads that hold us to the standard that the citizens who elect us expect us to adhere to. And all we're asking is that others be held to that same standard who are not residences of this state. And in many cases, what we are exactly doing is telling them that they must meet that same standard as a contributor here in Georgia wants to give a Georgia state senate candidate a contribution. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate you bringing this good bill. Thank you, Mr. President. We're going to have Senator from the 41st wave. With that? You have no more questions, Senator. With that, Mr. President, I ask everyone to let's hold everybody to the same standard the 56 of us are held to. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. We're going to have Senator from 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to make sure we're clear this bill is not as exciting as some people want to make it. This bill has nothing to do with any campaigns going on right now. This bill was followed over a year ago. This bill simply says that if we're going to have outside groups like a super PAC, there's poor money in doing, politicking in our state for a candidate, if they'll play by the same rules the rest of us play by. If you vote against this bill, then what you're saying is that folks inside our state have to play by the rules. But folks on the outside are not held accountable. Without passing this, our ethics commission can't go and even investigate these outside groups. We have to have this tool for our ethics commission to go and make certain that groups that poor money into our state want to influence our elections, can't for a particular candidate have to play by the same rules everybody else plays by. That's all this bill is doing. I just want to make sure we're clear for the record. This is something that will make everybody play by the same set of rules in our campaigns. So happy to take any questions. Do you have one question, Senator? Thank you. I recognize what? Yes, Senator's yielded. You do have one question, Senator. Recognize Senator from the mic. Thank you, Mr. President. So I'm a little unclear how we're determining what a bad actor is. You all keep saying it, but under what conditions are you saying as a bad actor and how is that verified and you see them on there? So can you elaborate on that? Yes, a great question. So we don't know the bad actors are without the ability to investigate. So right now without this bill, our ethics commission can't even determine whether or not someone technically is a bad actor. They can't go in subpoena records. They can't go and do what complaints. So someone's not following our rules. We have certain disclosure rules. We have certain things you have to put on notices when you do ads of course. If a group is not complying with that without this ability, if they're outside of our state without this bill, we can't even figure out whether or not they are a bad actor. We're not changing the rules. This bill does not determine who's good or bad or who can influence our elections, who can play an election. All this bill is saying that we will not have the tools to hold the people outside of our state accountable to so that people inside our state are. The senator further you? Yes. Yes, I got that and I understand that this piece of legislation would allow you to be able to go after a bad actor, but it still has not answered my question. How are you determining what a bad actor is even if we pass this bill? Are you going to look at a name and say, oh, hey, that looks kind of in the areas that looks like a bad actor. So I am trying to establish where in this bill that puts guardrails and kind of some rules on what you are establishing as a bad actor. Well, it's a whole different topic. This bill does not establish who a good or bad actor is. All this bill is doing is saying our ethics commission can go and do their job. The same way the groups inside Georgia, outside of our state. So the topic you bring up is a whole different topic. If you want to change the current rules, that will be a whole different bill, different part of the code. This just says now we will have the tools to know what is happening with these outside groups that come in. So the bill has nothing to do with that. Okay. I am sorry, Senator. I am still a little confused about what we are considering a bad actor. I think that is still not quite defined for me and maybe I am missing something but. You are not missing something. It is not in the bill. That is not this bill. So if you want to decide what a bad actor is, you could go to the code section that defines that and we give the jobs, our ethics commission to regulate this and oversee this. This bill is just again making certain that those from outside of our state that are coming in and pour money into elections, play by the same rules. This doesn't change the rules themselves. So if we don't pass this and that means those groups outside of our state, let's say you have a primary that you have, someone running against you, you could have a group from outside of our state come in and directly violate the current rules or do things that deserve an investigation. If you don't pass this, we can't investigate that. You couldn't hold that group accountable versus someone in Georgia who has to play by the rules. Okay. Is Senator Fredo you? Yes. Okay. I know we passed the bill somewhere around my first year, 2021 to allow the establishment of PACs. I think the governor uses one, these leadership PACs. How would that impact, this bill impact because that particular bill does allow anyone to feed money into those PACs and we're not investigating who they are or considering them bad actors. So again, it's a whole different topic. How those PACs work, whether or not a PAC qualifies as someone that has the same rules for a campaign for a candidate, that's completely separate. And I understand the argument, but that's a whole separate issue. If you want to change that, you have to bring a different bill. The bill for us today is just about the enforcement and making sure everybody plays by the same rules. But you shouldn't oppose this because you don't like the rules. If there's a rule you don't like now, you should follow the bill and change that rule versus saying, well, people inside state have to abide by the rules. But I'm going to vote against this because outside groups shouldn't be held accountable. Thank you, Senator. I recognize Senator on the 55th. Well, the gentleman here, yes, sir, from my great hometown area, Griffin Georgia. That's right. I'm a little concerned that the previous senator stating about what is a bad actor and I in this atmosphere of politically charged going after each other in retribution. Is there a provision, for example, that there must be probable calls to investigate? Quote unquote, these particular bad actors, how does that come about? Well, that's, again, not an expert on election law. We're both attorneys in our areas. We practice and not expert on that. But that's not part of this bill. So there's a whole process set up as to someone that has an allegation made against them. There's ethics complaint filed and there's an investigation of that complaint. There's due process and administrative procedures act where someone could be heard. There's also a way to take that to a superior court to enforce those orders as well. There's a whole process and code that's set up. This doesn't change any of that. This just says groups outside of our state abide by the same rules that the groups inside of our state play by. We're gentlemen for the year. Yes, sir. I am a little concerned that this not be used as a political pawn to publicize that your court and court are investigating some group because you don't like their political views. Is there any, are there any safeguards that we can have so that someone does not abuse their power to publicize and put on the front page of the newspaper that they're investigating some group simply because they do not agree with their particular political views. Again, Senator, that's a different topic, but I would say instead this protects everybody because right now, look, we operate in the world of extremes a lot of times. Let's use an extreme example. If we do have a real bad actor, someone that we both would agree is a bad actor who doesn't want to play by our rules is very simple without this bill. If you vote against this bill, that bad actor could go one county over. Let's go to West Georgia instead of saying in Carroll County, they could go over and cross the state line and they could then not have to play by our rules. We have no way to even investigate that. What I found is someone who's had a lot of elections over the years, people throw things out and the best thing that could happen is to have an actual complaint filed so it can be investigated. Due process can be heard without this bill, you can't even have that due process. You only have a way to investigate someone that's being accused of doing something wrong outside of our state. I think this actually brings more due process and makes certain that everybody plays by the same rules. Thank you, sir. I think you're helping me out. So basically this would be initiated with someone making a complaint and then the body would then investigate those persons. Is that the way it would work? I think that the commission has the ability to also initiate their own investigations in addition to complaints. That doesn't change any of this, but yes, there still has to be an investigation first. The first step you're doing with this bill is making sure that investigation could happen. Okay, I agree we should investigate, put on quote, bad actors if we can agree that they are bad actors. But are these complaints under verified? Are they verified so that if you are lying on me that I can come back and have some recourse? If the person is doing a false affidavit against my organization? Yeah, again, it's not part of the bill. The minor standing is there is due process or the Ministry of Procedure's Act where someone has a hearing if they're accused of something. And we're both lawyers. We know the best thing you want when you're accused of something and you're innocent is to have your day in court and to let the investigation play out versus leaving an allegation out there for the public to make their own decisions on. So this bill again does not change the current rules. It doesn't identify who's bad or who's good. All this is saying is that our commission that we've tasked with making those terminations and investigating these issues for us can do their job outside of the state of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you very kindly, sir. Thank you. You get one more question, Senator. Rick, I'm Senator from 27th. Thank you, Mr. President. Chairman, do you yield? Yes, sir. I'm all right. This has to do with the State Ethics Commission, is that correct? That's correct. And is it not true that the State Ethics Commission, as you just said, either receives complaints and they can either administratively dismiss those complaints if there is no probable cause or they can bring them before the State Ethics Commission and or they can open ethics complaints on their own accord, is that not correct? That's correct. It is not true that this bill does not change any of that and that the term bad actors is nowhere in the bill, but that is your own description essentially of what we're talking about here. That's correct. The bill has nothing to do with who's good or who's bad. Even the current process that we have, this bill again just makes certain that someone can abuse our process. Abuse our system by moving across the state line. Do you for the yield? Yes. Isn't it true that it's not just a requirement to, that this bill is not trying to address even necessarily moving across state lines? But what this bill is trying to address hypothetically would be me hiring an out of state consultant to run negative ads against an opponent knowing that if there was illegal money used in such a way that the State Ethics Commission does not currently have the ability to go subpoena of the bank records of the out of state consultant. So what we are trying to do here is close a loophole that currently perhaps has been exploited. We don't really know if it's been exploited or not because we can't go do that, but this essentially will seek to stop the practice of using dark money to hire out of state consultants to prevent the State Ethics Commission from ever getting the sunlight into these matters. Is that not true? It's a great way of putting it. You make it personal for all of us. It's like the official rules all of us who have campaigns. If you vote against this bill, what you're doing is allowing yourself the ability to go and hire an outside consultant from a different state, a group from a different state, and they could then come and support your campaign, go against your opponent without playing by the same rules everybody else plays by. This makes certain that we all play by the same rules. I know further questions. Thank you. Right now, the Senate from the 14th. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I rise in support of the legislation brought by the Senate from the 29th. And Senate from the 42nd, you've got to promise not to clip this video, but basically everything that the Senate from the 42nd said on this bill I agree with, I think is correct. Not even remotely close, Mr. Leader. This is a jurisdictional bill and I want to speak briefly about the code section that follows 91090, which defines a non-resident, and that code section is 91091, which is Georgia's long-armed statute, which determines what rights in state citizens have vis-a-vis out of state residents. Now, this is a funny one. This is a funny story. Senator from Forsyth County, I don't know if you remember this, but you had a former colleague, Zara Kerenchek, I can say her name. She's not here. Wonderful person and helped connect me to some senators when I was serving in the state house. And I said, I'd love to work on this long-arm issue. And Zara was like, listen, buddy, I got just the guy for you. So she connects me with the Senator over here and we had a phone call. This is years and years ago and I was trying to pitch this guy on the long-arm statute that we need to expand it. There's two ways that Georgia's rights against people out of state in this state are constrained. Two ways. One is what's called the federal constitution due process. You can imagine why if we just want to sue some person in Alaska who's never been to Georgia and knows nobody from Georgia, why that might not be fair, to force them to come to Georgia courts to defend against some kind of lawsuit. So the federal constitution has a basic guarantee that it's got to be fair, but then the other thing is our own state laws. Georgia state laws limit the ability for Georgia residents to go after out of state businesses if they do something wrong. And that's actually a pretty significant area of Georgia's rights that we are curtailing for no reason except we've just decided to tie our own shoelaces together. This is the pitch I was given the good Senator a few years ago. And it's not like some kind of trial or your defense thing. It's about Georgians and our ability to protect our rights vis-a-vis people who are out of state. So a good example of that is if somebody from out of state says something defamatory or concocts some kind of business interference plan or fraud and they have very few contacts with Georgia but they target their harm into Georgia. There's not a guarantee that Georgia law allows Georgia citizens to sue them in Georgia court the way that the Georgia laws are currently written. So it's not just the ethics issue. It's actually a range of issues where Georgia law under protects Georgia citizens rights vis-a-vis people out of state. So I think this is a really good bill. It's a really good bill because it basically says if there's out of state problems, I mean it's again I don't want to, you guys harm too much today, but what you just heard from the Senator from Forsythe and the Senator from the 42nd about the ability for somebody to use an out of state entity to harm what's happening in state is absolutely correct and this doesn't change. The underlying ethics laws, again if you want to change the ethics laws you got to go into a different part of the code. So this is a good bill. It is in line with other reforms we also need to increase Georgians rights vis-a-vis people out of state who might do harm and I'll be voting yes on this legislation today. Happy to take any questions. You do have a couple questions, Senator. Regan, I'll send them from the 41st. Thank you Mr. President. This Senator you. I do. Just to help some of my colleagues with a timeline here, isn't it true that this bill was brought forward last session before certain activities that are on TV on a regular basis began? Yeah that's right and the other thing I'll say and I think the minority party finds ourselves in this situation a lot where look we're not always going to agree with the majority parties administration. If the executive, if the governor is from a different party, we're not always going to agree with the way that the laws are enforced but I think there's a basic fairness and conscience test by us if we were in charge would we like to have the authority to go out of state and regulate what somebody does out of state in our elections. I think the answer to that is yes. If the basic operation of governance requires that you have the authority that you need to go after people who are violating our laws and I do think there's a loophole right now where out of state actors are able to do that and the timing I think absolutely suggests that there is no specific intention in this bill to address anything we're seeing right now. Do you further you? I do. Isn't it true that this can impact legislators on either side of the aisle in both ways that all of us are vulnerable to this type of behavior regardless of party. Senator, I aim to earn my rule of law messaging. I aim to earn my annoying speeches about how the rule of law matters and so if I want to earn those talking points with my colleagues one good faith way to do that is to acknowledge that yes this is basic good government, meat and potatoes stuff and I would like for Georgians rights to be robust as to out of state actors that potentially do harm. Thank you Senator. Yeah no further questions. Thank you miss president. Look at us all getting along in here today. I'll tell you what. Overhouse bill nonetheless. A year old house bill.
