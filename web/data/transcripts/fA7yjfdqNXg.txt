TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
Senate, state and local government operations committee meeting, and we do have a
core, which is four members. So the first thing that we have on our agenda is a substitute
to House Bill 374. We can probably arrange for you to have one.
There's a real big question, excuse me, representative Thomas, there's a real big question
about, you know, your leaf blowing in the things there, but we're talking about the rest
of it.
We talked about leaf blowing already.
I love what things people on the way.
So, is this mic on?
So I apparently am here to present LC-55-0091, a substitution for my bill HB-374.
And it's a touch that actually addresses two issues.
One is the leafblower act.
So it sounds like you all have had those discussions.
I, in my committee, government affairs this morning, I can tell you that I was a big proponent
of this bill.
I actually, I've sat on the study committee for electrification and transportation with
you, Mr. Chair, and you know, one of the things that I think was fundamental coming out
of that committee is the belief that we should have good energy policy that's inclusive
of all forms of energy.
And we shouldn't discriminate against any one to particular form, be it gasoline or electric.
So that's why you and I worked hard in setting up the infrastructure to make sure that there's
things in place for consumer to make choices on electric vehicles.
And I think this, the converse of that also has to be true, which is why I've been a big
supporter of this leaf blower bill and beyond that I see that in section two.
We have specific language regarding gas appliances.
I think gas appliances are things that are necessary.
They're probably in, I would say, a majority of homes, some are electric, some have some
electric, some have some gas, or combination air of, or one or the other.
But I think at the end of the day, we need to make sure we're protecting the consumer.
And both of all the language that's in this bill does that.
So at that time, or at this time, I'd be happy to accept any questions, having a couple
more comments, but I can do that after questions.
Any question for representative Thomas Ones?
Senator Estabelle, are you number five?
Number one.
Number one.
Okay.
There's a weird place to put you.
I don't think it's going to work, but we'll give it a try.
I'm going to try four.
Try that one.
Four it is.
That changes its label.
Question about the section two, I know we had discussed leaf blowers in the past.
I don't think this was in any of the previous versions that I've gotten, no state, no governmental
of the state shall adopt any policy that restricts or prohibits, and then it goes on.
Can you talk more about the need for this, that restriction, on what governmental entities can restrict?
Well, sometimes we partition separate layers of government, local government, state government, federal government,
government but at the end of the day it's still government you know to me I
might my people back home it's government is government okay and what we
need to do is we need to protect the people at home this is about consumer
choice and protecting the consumer and making sure they have energy choices
that are available to them that make good free market sense to let's just be
honest I mean we have huge inflation we've got I mean every our people are
getting beat up every which way.
So taking away any option or forcing them to go
to an electric option that may be more expensive to them
isn't the right.
So this just makes sure that we have consumer protections
in place that people can pick what energy source is best
for them.
And go ahead.
Senator S. Mass, as you recall,
your correct section one was basically the leaf
little bill we heard earlier.
section 2 has been added to this bill, which I believe was represented by Anderson's bill
that allows a consumer choice on types of fuel that they use for cooking or heating
or whatever the case may be and we're just piling on as they say at what we do real well.
I know this is your first year, but we do this very well in the last few days of session.
I can attest that the last few days of session have been very exciting, it'll only get worse.
Did that answer your question?
That did, that did.
Question and I know that when this bill passed a Senate, it had a sunset 10 years, 12
years, ten years from now? Eight and a half years from now. I was wondering if we'd be open to that.
The I think Senator Steele has a little answer for you on that one. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
Senator Estevez. During the House presentation of SB 145 motion was made and accepted,
not at my urging, but they just felt that the free market would catch up to that, and they made the decision without consultation to do that.
And so because the guest appliance bill did not have the language on the sunset clause, they wanted it to neither of them to have the sunset.
on set so they voted to remove it even though we had added it as an amendment on the Senate
floor the House Governmental Affairs Committee voted to remove that on both sections and so
this morning when we presented SB 145 to House Government Affairs they reinforced that.
Representative Thomas, we're in a unique position right now.
I'm going to reach out to my legislative council over here to give me a little guidance.
If we take action on this and move, do pass, and it passes to the, it gets reported back
to the Secretary of the Senate.
If we wanted to do a substitute tomorrow on this bill, we would be not following proper
procedure to do that.
we can have a meeting tomorrow. And we're not positive whether we'll get the
ruling to have a committee meeting tomorrow. We're trying to make it a
Christmas tree. I would expect as such, I don't know if you're in the
governmental affairs over in the house, so I understand. And so that being the
case, we're at that point where a little divine intervention would be good to
to know whether we think we can get another committee meeting tomorrow to brighten our
tree. It is spring. Favorite time of year. Yeah. So we're on the right
I don't want to hold this fine piece of legislation up on the fact that it may be a Christmas
tree bill, so if your discretion said we can go one way or the other, but for me I think
it'd be best for our committee to move it forward and then we can kind of well to come
back. I'll have to present it on the House floor for a degree disagree. So if I may though
I would, in government affairs for the, it's SB 145.
We kept the author's language in the bill.
I have some language that's actually been approved
by GMA and ACCG.
We come to an agreement with the annexation language.
We happy to take a look at it and see if we can.
Have your book here, I think the test box of that.
Why don't we do that?
Why don't we allow our friends at ACCG and GMA
to talk to you a little bit of language substitution here.
I'll be over.
You might have to give him a give a chair.
How's the set?
I can see.
Okay, all right.
What is he?
All right, all right.
Have you seen this?
Yes.
Are they okay?
Yes, sir.
Yes, are you Rushi if you
Rushi if you tell general counsel GMA. Yes, we worked with representative Thomas and the members of the House
governmental affairs committee and leader of station on language for many many hours yesterday and
Have come to agreement on
I believe it's a ends at one two is that yeah, that's one to us. Yeah
What we're looking at is an amendment that's amendment 47 0 0 5 9 and I'm going to read
the amendment for you.
It's to amend chapter 36, title 36 of the physical code of Georgia annotated, relating to municipal
annexation of territory so as to provide for municipal de-annexation of property
by application of 100% of property owners to provide procedures, conditions, and limitations
to provide for admiral orm taxes so to prohibit de-annexations where there is
outstanding municipal bond obligations to authorize municipalities to continue to provide services
to de-annex property in certain circumstances. And basically this seems to be an agreed upon
on, I think ACCG, I could, it gets missed.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Again, Todd Edwards with the Association,
County Commissioners of Georgia,
we fully support the language in front of you.
I appreciate your consideration.
Thank you.
We'll get a copy of this back to our committee members
and we'll just add it to this language on this bill.
And then, Dana, we'll have a vote on the bill
as amended or by substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
you'll hold standby for a few minutes.
Unless you'll have some macabre's in your pocket.
Always, always have to wait on something.
I noticed that spring was sprung yesterday,
and you just got out today.
Yeah.
It just doesn't look good with my ties.
So you know, Representative Thomas
as an engineer wearing that kind of clothing,
I'm not sure that's, you know, I was going wild with stripes, I mean, you know, it was,
it was, it was, the, uh, engineers were supposed to just wear plain jeans, so, I'm emulating
my, uh, hero in the house with Alan Powell supporting my, uh, he, he is my state rep and
I'm fortunate to have him, so, uh, I see Miss Mitchell behind you from the city of Atlanta.
I don't know if you're familiar with this amendment.
They hear that one of the things,
we wanted to make sure that this didn't put life back
into a bill that has failed already.
So the center estimates, you have a question.
Yeah, while we're waiting, can you speak
to the genesis of this bill and the purpose behind it?
Oh, so that's this one, this is off.
When you say this bill, I'm assuming,
you mean in totality or just my amendment section.
Only I have been blown away by the end of the year.
I'm trying to have a little bit of humor.
I'd like to understand the annotations.
OK, so the deanxation piece has been a request
of the board commissioners,
or Cherokee County for at least 10 years.
It's been on legislative agenda.
We, I mean, I could start three years ago.
I mean, this has been a process.
But three years ago, several of us set,
we had a house committee on annexation and cityhood.
And during that process,
one of the things that came up continually
was about property rights.
and better city services or city provides better services.
But to me, it was always about the property rights issue.
I think that one of the things
that I actually I truly agree with the GMA on
is the fact that if someone wants to be in a city,
they should be able to be allowed to be in a city.
I don't think we should stop people.
This is so nuanced, it's hard to kind of get
to where I'm going here.
But now, if that's true, I believe his, I believe in parody and processes.
I believe that if one thing is good, then the converse should also be good.
However, in effect, that doesn't always work out that way.
So, we started off with a 20-page bill that had had concerns,
specifically, but using the 60% method.
So our first negotiation was, you know, we got rid of the 60% method.
And after that, we had, through our committee process,
we had I guess four hearings and committee in the house
before it went to the house four,
which obviously passed, I think it was 144 to,
so many against, 20 something against.
And through that process, we boiled that bill down
to 100%, it's very limited to just a couple of parcels
of time that it's allowed to do per application and there was some issues about which I think
has specifically been was brought up thanks to the city of Buckhead movement with regards
to geobonds.
So being that that was one of the major sticking points originally what we wanted to do
was set up a special tax district that if people wanted to leave there would be a special
tax district set up to pay for the geobonds out on the property. But then there was questions
with regards to requirement of having a result that we're not going to start.
Yeah, well, no, I'm doing really good here, man. Yeah, yeah. I've learned. I'm not a fast learner,
but if you give me enough time, I'll figure it out. So because of that, that called into question.
We said, okay, well, let's just take that off the table. So one of their final negotiations,
part of what happened last night is we said okay if you have a Geobahn or Revenue
Bond such then we wouldn't you know what you would just be exempted and and that
was kind of where we got and I feel like that's probably the best language that
we're going to be able to put forward so at least at this time
Just at the beginning of the end, okay.
So just to double check my understanding, the municipality would have to agree to the
Diannexation.
No, that's not the way that this works.
So what it does is it sets up a third process for Diannexation, okay.
So everything else is the same.
The Diannexation process in and of itself, the city would still be the ultimate on the
Diannexation, but they would be, I believe they would have to do it if it was approved
through the county, okay?
And go ahead Todd, you can tell you want to talk.
Under current law, if you're within a city, there's no process by which, if you want
to Diannex, you have to have the city's permission.
This bill removes the unilateral veto authority of the city but puts in certain safeguards
so the city can still object under what you'll see in front of you as health-safed
your welfare, which is relatively broad.
So if they can prove that it's not just a harm to welfare of the de-annexing parcels
or to the city itself, I believe that language, then they could object to it.
It does, you know, again, when you want to annex into a city, the county can't say no.
There's a process and objection that's a little lengthy.
But this kind of mirrors the process of annexation, but goes to the annexation with certain provisions
that you've tried to reach where work out with you.
And that's, I think that's the crux.
This bill is really tailored for somebody that's out on the periphery of a city.
I mean, obviously you can't create an un-acorporated island.
So it's somebody that, a couple parcels on the edge of the city that maybe don't feel
like they're getting the city services that they want or for whatever reason they'd like
to be the annexed out of the city.
This gives them an alternate application process and it's, if I can interrupt just a minute,
I think Senator Steele has a motion that he wants to make.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
