----------
the future generation. This is why I have been working on HVSV-2-2 and V-1-C-V-2, that is
established alcohol running by the river, beginning the disease in the corporate sector.
Schooling to develop and study alcohol running spaces in the government, and secondly school.
Syngenously, I've been calling the Department of Natural Resources, the Joint Global Integration
Coalition.
It is the 248th, which will establish the position of the Director of our Global Integration.
The Joint Global Integration Coalition consists of 24 different organizations working on the
is to build on our public life's heritage.
Georgia listeners, regardless of their race,
zip code, or economy status, are
likely to fail just because of environmental protection
that can shoot at the end of life and the safe outdoor
information.
Then, to the Georgia Coalition for Advancements
the foundation of justice, hosting this place even, bringing awareness to the foundation
of justice, issue-pacing, facing the leaders of the UN, and the UN.
We are continuing one of the most sensitively to the healthy and safe foundation of the UN.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Before we proceed, Representative Evans, I just wanted to recognize the coalition partners.
So if you don't mind when I call your name, because as we come with the police, we're going
to thank you for being here today.
Just please raise your hand and be recognized, okay?
Jordan Wan.
ECO passion, we have college here, and science for Georgia.
All right, just a couple of these organizations that we hear,
that's not wanted to make sure that I acknowledge you.
And thank you for your collaboration and all of your hard work.
Now let's take this in and come in.
All right.
Thank you so much, Emma.
and it's so great to be with you all of me today.
My partner just to say the handphone.
I'm saying that the same with Becky Evans,
and I just wanted to say that I'm so proud
to be here with all of you, all of the partners
in my fellow legislators
on this really important day.
And you can talk just a little bit about the rest
of your children, your childrens at the eighth harness.
in the end, I was a electricity bill,
press and emission, and my business owners
have been similar to my business owners,
and they're interested in purchasing
a free large share of the state in Purdue.
And so we need to address this,
and we need to work with our utilities to address this.
I have our position on the Georgia's first fund,
and with the provisions of the advocacy utilities,
We're naming excess products of property,
within a number of 2.5% profit,
they take a little bit of evidence for money,
and then put it into a run,
which I hope are living in Georgia's.
So it's going to give the portability
and consumations.
The General Veterans Services
are probably not a big stand-up company.
And it's not because this money is made
and it's not because it's on high,
there is a group of sick cutters.
I've never tried to produce electric bills
for customers living in these centers.
And perhaps, if you're in the first five final tests,
it's to dress the needs of blowing back
that risk and kind of let us be concerned
across the state of Georgia.
So I want to work with you with all of your
and all of your organizations and my colleagues
and me to bring about some legislation
working to enhance the health, the well-being
and over all the students of all Georgia's business,
especially those most important
to their sustainably environmentally-safe
and business.
And also, we need to do this with my harness and support
so that the needs of all the crowd of Georgia's
and our neighbors can be addressed in a timely manner,
but that we need to learn about truly making Georgia
a great place to work in business.
So I join you in these efforts.
Thank you so much.
There we go.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, and now all you know, represent the 160th House District, Coastal Georgia, Liberty County.
Let's, like Fred said a lot, and Fred's over 50 years, even though his brother was a man of Fred to be the few we see was a Jew.
That's it. I'm hearing some people about mental justice. I'm here because of the fight
with the court. But I'm not here just to observe it. I've been on the Liberty County
Development Authority for 24 years and I've been chairman. I turned this chair to start
in general. In this time, I've been involved in negotiations with all about
100 companies that we've looked at for the time I've spent for how do you
balloon what's your track record when is it you manufacture and what the science
they end up doing with Bob and the other side there needs a neat
families, they must be back, but I was in kind of both sides. They built the building
and they burned it away. The balance was me. It all joined the jobs I desperately need.
But don't get through desperate until you take here in here. I unfortunately don't want to
many years. The day that is brought, remain in communities of color. And it brings to mind
why you've worked for the crime and protection agency for many years. And watch the
Superfund be developed. And watch the largest Superfund area in the country. It's in
and no children taught it, hurt to me for years and years
about the product of the baby.
And unfortunately, I don't know why I didn't tell you.
We have houses occupied by citizens that there's no father
away from me, to the staircase.
The interest there are to me, the needs will care to me.
There could be years and years and years.
And there's a physical portion of the amount of cancer
In fact, community of color, it knows me.
There must never ever be a hurt to be incite in America.
Hi, nice to meet you.
And when you manage to, you must have jobs and move to it.
And there are a lot of companies out there
that should be bringing to the community
And not sell your health for the sake of your job.
Yeah!
I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you.
I love you.
You've got to be conscious of what a thing can most do.
Especially those of you that are active,
you have to be sure that you'll be able to develop
a little more in the meetings.
Because if you're not in the table,
you're going to be on the menu.
Yeah!
I love you.
I love you.
I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
But when you come and let your voices be heard, there is extremely important and the most important thing in the world is catch your back, right?
If you're going to raise heaven, have documented truth in your praise and heaven.
Don't come and make a promise when you don't know why you're lost.
Make sure that you leave the planet, that God created in seven days, that lasted for years.
And in the last 100 years, man has done all the good to destroy the professor of God's life.
Our mental justice is important.
And you've got to stay in the fight. I'm so glad and excited to see my colleagues and this
feel that it's moving that we must get behind and perhaps take a bit to find what's
getting behind is important. But let's do it. Let's do all we can, while we can, and
and please vote soon with this grand show,
with this great, great grand show.
A legacy of the people.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, Zaya.
Please support House Bill 12's good afternoon.
I'm sorry to start your speech about environmental justice.
They give it up to me to speak to them.
I am the theory of faith and I can make it happen.
To speak about the need for the environmental justice and the state of truth.
As we do, I have witnessed the devastation of climate change,
policies, rules and mechanisms that allow environmental racism to permeate our neighborhoods.
The policies of police have allowed for graces to instra initiatives that would use our air
and soil and water.
My thanks of the asthma.
Many of my family members have lung disease.
And many of them have never smoked.
Rural communities have covered poor, overburdened.
Decades have been in their chemical plants.
bio-mask ways, submit ways, recycle ways, and various international ways.
Every due to trends, serious conflicts, and harmful diesel useless,
adverse impact of the code.
Our medicines have the power to prevent any cancer out of it in Georgia.
We don't want to suffer as a people between maiden groups
that your needs are suffering with unprecedented rates of cancer or petrochemical
cancer. I, who are our legislators, to establish, get bipartisan, me. We're together in a
well-being of those who continue to suffer because of the profit over me.
All right, Billard!
Who are these people?
I ask you,
what is a world without environmental justice?
What is a world without justice?
Please pass half the bill to the city
we are debating on the bank.
I'm going to see it here for the Conservatives, the county, I come here for the deep south
Georgia.
I'm going to see it there and I'm here because House Bill 263, the Governor of Justice
Bill is very important because I realize that we can get this regarding when it comes
We were talking in the comments that they did not have considered the number of rapids in our area, and that was a subtle amount of bases.
And that's why we stand through the work in
with legacy of the national community,
cities in our community that has movement and traces.
This only based on the common novelty of that,
there was a plant next door.
So now we have some protection
where we live, where our children play
from the human, from the human to the impact industries.
This is it.
The next door.
Why do we have to be even trying to earn money
While in what I mean by that is what we see, our community members, our friends, and our loved ones disappear here and here, because they live near that land.
The one that was there since 1919, and we said, the one that left the grid so soaked into the soil and impacted the ground water, that land.
When we hear those stories, if you look for the smokes that's in town and in any place in
Georgia, just on the west side, on the south side, that leads to the one where we have
the stench and air that people come to commonly to be in the custody too.
And this is why today we act for House Code 263 of EPS, for annual Georgia, for leaving
I'm not in about that, but from all of those town,
so we may not see the face,
but we hear their cries and their concerns.
We want infants that build and have those that kill us.
We, there, are you talking about that?
Yeah!
What about harmony and hurting humans?
And we are sick and tired of being sick and tired,
and we're also very weird here today,
and we're asking you to consider us to see us
to protect us, to see our children,
and protect our nation by passing
how filled 12 to 163,
the environment for justice at the end,
because clean and water is a human right.
Absolutely.
Yes, we will say that.
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Hey, I'm 21.
Inside of this, I'm just going to
I'm not sure what I'm trying to add, except I would tell you, I've been a striker for 17 years, and that one thing I know is that we're re-keener is when nobody else is re-keener, people call re-keener, we class, we study bomb lists in the county, we all listen, so we end up working in the middle of a quantum environment of justice issues just out of our base, and there is absolutely no doubt that I have that here,
But you can see, I'm all remember, that the all side of the state is lit up in wood.
That means that we have designated communities.
We also have state riverside.
We also have vocals.
We also have dns of chemical.
We also have solid chemicals.
We also have acupuncture plants too.
Yes, but they're located.
They certainly not located in places where people work in those companies.
They're located in a quarter of the units.
and actually, you know what, we take that back,
they're not going to be for communities.
They're located in Black communities,
but then you take this advantage.
There's a few issues.
There's a few issues.
There's a few issues.
Well, again, welcome to our first meeting.
And yes, we're here at the same house.
But one, the feds are trying to pour money,
as fast as they can into environmental justice communities.
Georgia needs to be in the forefront.
We need to be in the forefront.
I'm working at that point in here to make a difference.
The other thing I'm going to argue is,
we're not telling the story.
So I'm in Augusta, we have a thing called
Healthy Augusta.
We started because we have fought for years
to keep people from companies from continuing
their determination.
A bunch of them left and then within six months
they dropped about four of them back again.
It's not the least it goes.
So we've worked out the emphasis, but that's enough.
Like, we've got to tie environment in public health.
There is a time, there is absolutely a time,
but we don't recognize it.
But when somebody says environment,
that that means that there's a child
who's got a few points and just goes down
and doesn't necessarily have a map.
And yeah, so what I want to urge you today
is to go back and tell the story that's not
in the history books.
Go back and figure out how you're new to music.
What are the stories that have been told?
Where are the twenty-five men that died in ladder cage
and have a cup of coke?
Right?
Those stories have to be told
because you have to clean up what's there now
and prepare the YouTube stuff.
You guys are incredible.
Here, this is awesome.
Keep it going.
Thank you.
For the 50 marks in the Latinos nationwide, live in regions around the world with severe droughts,
on-personnelting areas, and rising sea levels.
Latinos will also make up the majority of the workforce into six impacted by climate change
such as lack of culture, manufacturing and construction.
or seeing the impact that we know that we do this so much more.
No social medicine will be gone.
That is why I'm standing together with nine of them.
There's nothing in the process that I'm doing to advocate our HD1263.
A bill that would prioritize a fair enforcement of the environment
from substance law.
It's your damage and transparency of the whole of the animal.
Corporation that are destroying our land and our community.
And most importantly,
We are here and we will continue to occupy this space, but we don't want it to be a moment.
We ask you to stand in line with us and ask each one to sit free
for the so-called maximum reward.
And as all of us know,
those little students, how much they are very serious.
Thank you.
It's a young woman, Alabama, on an angle of high-tech work, I think we should take
Because we were standing on our shoulders, and we did a lot of work, we put in the work of the last piece of work we put in.
was a union, and that unity was by the American House, aimed at one of the places that
and represented in the Alpeners, talked about him
around his country.
Unfortunately, it ain't yet perfectly.
With the most of the units in the room in the state
of New York, most of us don't know their expertise.
that 27.5% of the superfund sites in the state of Illinois is in Glen County.
Most people don't know that 17 recall sites,
which is super fun sites meant by the state of Georgia.
We are here because the state of Georgia is not down.
But we haven't been introduced to the action that should come from the Bible.
The first amendment that God did to us is to take care of the creation of the creation of the Him,
putting it place.
But what has happened to us is our preachers have lost their minds.
And all that is interested in Him is the great change we can give Him
to put free the trust of those of us, who work, give, have no resources to do it with,
but we have made it clear, as we did with that illusion that we did have her name.
We still have difficulties with our role from the church, that we don't wear much because
our religion has turned a rage, it's turned a rage because people pretend that they're
they want to do something about the nasty earth, filthy, bad, war, sorry, dish, they pretend
I might want to do something, but we didn't come down to the very idea of playing in the world.
You take time.
Oh, right!
You saw what we are.
And we have great faith that we have been given those faiths to meet George along.
We have created that we were given enough space today to be within your action, who has come
on many a month against the dirty, nasty community we live in to shape up.
12, 6, and 3 is holding the piece that a great value in your heart.
If you think that what's going to happen is the snake of Georgia,
is going to branch the piece that you want to have.
From heaven, clean water, clean air, and clean soil.
Especially, I am 85 years old and children.
I have been working in this government for four years now.
And I've seen for who could speak well, I've seen them.
And they've come from all over the world.
I know them from the places that we have called.
Cancer, Alec.
But they don't know from who Jordan is, Cancer Lane.
We got to get serious here.
Take that call, please, we've got the spirit.
We have a good call, and he has a name.
He's working with us in a group of groups we call great force.
And it is how to act in a group, how to defense,
the outcomes of defense and justice.
We do not know that our business will be destroyed
a next minute, right, without right here.
We couldn't get some that much of that here.
We know for the moment that we were all,
we know what we need for you.
We don't have resources, we can't hear all of them.
I'll put those in your brain and let me talk to somebody
who ran without a thing.
Just like the community is asleep right now, we are going back with Trent System 3 and
tell the preacher, we are going to run you on the church, if you don't make us a lobby,
we have to be a lobby.
That's all I need to explain today.
We'll have to know for all of us.
Got it, I'm just a big police.
That's why I don't speak in Georgia.
Ain't going to work that hard.
Well, if you didn't get that for a call to ask, then I'm going to work with you, too.
I would have first recognized my colleague, Y'all, but I'm going to get more of you to live here today.
I'll say you're going to need to help you.
And to my colleagues, to my friends, the play of play, the activists,
to all that stands together to champion House Bill 1263.
Thank you.
The time has come and our time has come.
But Georgia, environmental justice has been first in
how it's been going for years now.
It is four years over here.
That's my friend who has said,
this is not just a human problem.
This is a simple one.
This meal is not just a meal.
It is a bill of hope for communities, it's a world bill, it's a suburban bill, it's an urban bill, we have the rights to have clean water, soil, air, we have the rights to have toxins for food, this is a emergency of public health prices.
And we stand to hold those accountable.
So this bill is going to require stand agencies
to consider the impacts of environmental happens
on not just people of color, but all on earth now.
This bill encounters all the rights
and the wrongs of the past
and ensures that every joy and every child going forward is healthy at home.
And what really gets to me is that my colleagues refuse to want what's in the best interest of going home and going home.
So, this bill is young just about addressing the injustices, but it's about building a brighter
or sustainable future for generations to come by bending, loosening prevention methods
and community helps us.
We're safeguarding that help,
and we'll be meeting our citizens,
and laying on top of this,
to prepare for our more prosperous New Year.
So let's not just standing together,
we're gonna take action together.
All right.
All right.
We're gonna come back in.
Now, we get this done now.
We don't just need, we need not need
for this bill to be heard in committee.
We need to be voted out for the day of May
to help explore. So we can quote, and this is your call to action, to make sure you're
calling the chair of the passport there in the head of our office.
We want to go to the office.
We will find way where we are. We will pay. We will simply require that this is the
right thing to do in this year's season.
We went on the time six, three times,
half a year.
So as Georgia thrives and survives,
we're gonna make sure we're at the table,
declaring that this is going to be a healthy Georgia.
This will be in modern environments
where we sound Georgia,
where everybody has rights
and we treat freedom with dignity,
respect, and we will be environmental stewards. Thank you for being here today. You have your
watching orders. Listen, you have the voice. We have a minute. When we come together, I'm glad to have
I want you to get things done.
I am saying, but we will go out and get it done.
That's true.
Thank you all so much, Jeremy.
I really appreciate it.
Everyone has come through.
Everywhere in our store,
my voices are squished,
even working so hard.
Look at what we have here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We will have all of that.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We want to go to the floor and we want to sit at the heck of a bill.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
