TRANSCRIPT
----------
to order, we are going into standing committee where you have your agenda here and on the
agenda's SR465, Senator Dozall, we've got the summaries being passed out as we speak.
And Senator Dozall, I'm going to let you walk us through your fine piece of legislation.
You can go up there, that's fine.
That's where we do all our grandstanding in this committee room.
Hopefully no grandstanding today, Mr. Chairman, I'll walk you through this resolution.
We're with Legislative Council on the Secretary of the Senate's office in developing this.
And we are forming this one relatively familiar to the way we form study committees in the Senate.
And essentially what this resolution does is it forms the special committee on investigations.
it empowers that committee of nine members,
six from the majority party, three from the minority party,
to investigate the allegations that have been in the media
relative to the Fulton County prosecution,
I think we're all familiar with.
As we know, the state funds about $30 million
to the prosecuting attorney's council,
about $3 million of that goes to Fulton County.
And so what a lot of my constituents have been asking
is how has that money been spent?
Is there anything that needs to happen with state law?
Was there a conflict of interest here?
There's a lot of questions.
Mr. Chairman that are out there in the public
and we are merely going to empower this committee
to have those questions answered.
And then the committee will be able to,
as you see in the final whereas,
is we'll be able to make recommendations
as it relates to legislation that we may need to take
as a body to ensure that cases are prosecuted
in the state of Georgia as they should be.
So with that, I'm happy to take any questions, Mr. Chairman.
I got a question from Senator Beatch.
Yeah.
Chairman Dolezal, could you talk about lines 50 to 54
with subpoena power under oath?
Yes, so we have inherent subpoena power in the Senate.
That's codified in law and the code sections
that are mentioned there.
And obviously, due to the sensitive nature of this topic,
And what this resolution does is it confirms the powers of subpoena and taking testimony under oath to this special committee very similarly to the way that the senate does that in the senate rules to the ethics committee.
So the ethics committee in the case of ethics complaints being filed has that same authority.
So this committee for similar reasons will have the same power that we confer in our rules to the senate ethics committee.
Anderson has a question.
Senator, how soon would this committee be created?
It would be created upon passage on the floor of the Senate.
So from here, we'll go from standing rules to regular rules.
If it makes out of regular rules, it goes to the floor.
And then it goes to the floor.
You'll see language in here that gives the committee
on assignments the authority to make the appointments
of the nine members that I mentioned before.
So should this all move through the process,
the committee on assignments would take that up.
who has sent letters to those on the committee,
then the chairperson would have the ability
at any time to begin to have meetings of that committee.
Thank you.
I got a quick question on the subpoena.
Who enforces that subpoena?
Fulton County Court in a similar way
that the ethics subpoenas would be enforced.
And we've seen in the past where they have chosen
not to enforce the subpoena,
what measures could be taken at that point?
I would leave that to what I think will probably
legal experts on the committee to help us cross that bridge, should we come to it, certainly
hope it doesn't come to that. Fair enough.
Senator Watts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Dullesall. I appreciate you
bringing this. Just a question. This is a committee that is made and is there a time frame
on this, time limit, or is this in perpetuity? This would be an effect through this biennium.
this committee would exist as it's formed by this particular Senate chamber it would go
through the end of the year and that it would be we would need to form a new committee should
the Senate choose to do so at the start of next session.
You know what goes through the same process again.
Correct.
Got you.
There will always of course be the option for the Senate to adopt different rules at the
start of the next by any if they wish to have a committee that was a standing committee
similar way there are existing standing committees. Any further questions. All right. Thank
you, Senator Dulles off for that fine presentation. All right. What's the will of the committee?
Mr. Chairman, I'll move the pass on SR 465. Sorry. All right. I got a motion from Senator
Beach on the passing of SR 465 LC number 472726. I've got a second from
Senator Anderson. Is there any other further discussion? All in favor raise
your right hand. I can't vote. I'm showing you what to do. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I've got ten
all the polls same sign one two three okay motion passes that will go on to
the floor and up back to rules all right I think by having any other actions
I'd like to do and standing while we're here none all right standing is a
adjourned. I'm going to call our rules committee into order. Got your yellow sheet
here on bills that are available for consideration. So let's start with SB338.
Senator Setsler. The stand is yours. Mr. Chairman, members of the rules committee,
bring before you, Senate Bill 338. As you may know, the Northern District of Federal
Court struck down the 2022 reapportionment plan for the Cobb County Board of Education
on December 14th and issued an order that the General Assembly should redraw maps following
some prescriptions by the judge that meet consistent
reapportionment principles.
The initial order said that it should be done by the,
and enacted into law by the 10th of January.
That's not achievable, of course.
A subsequent order was given that that would be enacted
by the 22nd of January through both chambers
and some other governor.
We also know that's not procedurally possible.
That order was to achieve the 22nd of January
struck down by the in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals last week. Now there's
actually two motions in the 11th that affect the case. But in spite of all of
that, we as a legislature have an obligation to enact reapportionment
plans that comply with court orders that comply with the Federal Voting Rights
Act meet consistent reapportionment principles and that's exactly what you have
before you hear.
Senate Bill 338 is not the map passed by Representative Erhart in 2022.
It's not the map passed by any other partisan actor.
It is a map that is squarely committed to doing one thing and acting a map that follows
Judge Ross's order and puts in place a map in time for the Cobb County Board of Education
to have it be put in place in Cobb by the Board of Elections so that our primary can happen
and we can proceed.
So I'm asking a federal consideration of this committee.
We've taken the time we needed to do this.
A lot of work's gone into it.
I met for over three hours with a bipartisan group
of our delegation members.
The first week of session, over two separate days.
This had two hearings in committee
and I offered to the committee.
Be glad to take questions.
Any questions from the committee?
Thank you, Senator Setswar.
Okay, next up we've got SR 158, Senator Annert of the Tarte, in fact you got a couple
here if you want to cover both, that would be appropriate.
7-1, just remember that.
Your mic is hot.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, SR 158, this committee voted on last session, basically created a
logistics corridor in West Georgia from Hurd County up to Walker County and then I'm
Senator Dickson is actually going to present Senate resolution 344 on the floor if this bill ever gets called up
So I'm gonna let our expert of dogs here
present it
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
SR344 would recognize May 1st, 2024 as pure bread dog day
Thank you
Really
Seriously been working hard this all season huh
Proud of you. Thank you proud of you. Do you run that through your education committee?
No sir. No we didn't
Be glad to Mr. Chairman. I can't wait
Don't forget about the earth dog
dogs
How can we forget about earth dogs?
All right. Any questions for either of the authors? Senator Anderson, where are you now?
Senator Dixon, could you all the logo for the pure bread dogs, be a bulldog?
I think that would be purely appropriate here in the state of Georgia.
All right. Go doggies.
Good dogs. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Anderson's question, that may force me after voting, it's my
ability. If we do that, just for the record. I'll join you. Thank you. Okay.
Senator Summers, did you have something you'd like to talk to the committee
about? Yeah, that's how you get a bill passed. Representative Skoggins, would
as you like to address this fine, all-guess body.
Yes, sir, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is the same bill I presented last year
to the committee.
This is House Bill 290LC50645S.
And this is the bill that allows the tax commissioners
to contract with municipalities in the county governing
authority to collect municipal court
taxes for that municipality.
And we kind of put a few guidelines on it.
We limited the amount of the contract
could be far.
It could be no greater than 50% of the base pay
of the tax commissioner.
And it passed out of the House 161 to 1.
And I'll be glad to answer any questions.
Who is the one?
I don't know, not worth mentioning in their name, huh?
I know, there you go.
Any questions?
OK, thank you.
That one's on the general calendar,
and we'll make that available as soon as we can.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Any other members here that I can't see?
OK.
Senator Jones, did you, I've missed you on SR323?
I know we covered that in standing,
but if you want to give us a brief.
Chairman, it's number 12.
And this is to see how we can improve caregiver services,
something that many of us will have to face.
And just to basically see how the state can improve,
providing those services to help family caregivers
when somebody gets really sick,
catastrophic with sick and has to go home
and be taken care of.
Good deal.
Any questions for the author?
Okay.
All right, let's pick a few, so where am I on my list?
Senator Alvers.
I'll let you have a pick.
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to pick Senate Bill 338, please.
Okay.
Madam Leader, would you like a pick?
What, can you say that again? I'm sorry.
I'm going to let our newest member pick.
I'm going a little out of order about senior order here, but I want to see if he'll pick
his own bill.
What do you want?
I certainly will.
Drum roll.
SR344.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Say it again.
I want you to say it loud for our people.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to pick SR344.
I can't believe he picked it.
Man.
I'm not backing down.
I love it.
All right.
So for the floor tomorrow, we have SB338.
SB338, SR323, and SR344.
I've got a motion from Senator Albers do pass.
I got a second from Senator Beach.
All in favor say aye.
All opposed, same sign.
Motion passes, unanimous.
We're done.
All right, let's...
