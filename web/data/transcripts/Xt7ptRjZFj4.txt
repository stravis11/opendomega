TRANSCRIPT
----------
Oh, so happy to meet you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Now, thank you for joining us this afternoon.
We are here to discuss one thing.
One thing only this afternoon.
Today's vote on the certificate of need reform legislation.
Proud to voting yes on the legislation this afternoon.
I'll discuss my reasons for supporting this field.
I want to clarify our exact position.
No one on this stage behind me disagrees that a new
more-house teaching hospital would be a great thing.
No one disagrees that we need more rural hospitals and no one disagrees that we need the
of all the measures in this field to help combat our maternal mortality rates.
We all agree that these are worthwhile priorities, but we disagree that these measures along
the same Georgia health care access problems.
expansion is the only answer to that problem. My vote today was to show my
commitment to the area offered months ago. If we pass Medicaid expansion,
Democrats will support the certificate of need reform. Just like we saw last
year in North Carolina. Let me be clear. COA and Medicaid expansion must be done
together. If we choose another path or continue pursuing on a certificate of
need reform, I will not support these efforts. We must pass both. Period. That's our
offer. Certificate of need reform is a where they go, but certificate of need
reform alone will not save our rural hospice. It will not improve Georgia's
access to health care. We must have Medicaid expansion and certificate of
need reform together in order to solve these problems. Thank you all for
this thing to us. And if you have questions, any one of us can answer those questions
because we are on this state together. We are in this fight together.
Do you see the proposed commission as a real path towards potential metically
expansion? Or do you think that this is really, this year is really the only real
trial and expansion because you had the, the certificate of deep leverage, so does me.
Well, the commission itself would have moved along without us. It was the amendment that
I offered that made it more inclusive. Not to talk about some people, but all people
that need Medicaid scratch.
What is the status of the conversations with more house about taking over at the end of
the center?
Any computer call?
What is the status of conversations of more house taking over at the end of the medical
center?
Thank you very much for a big year and thank you for the question.
You've made a great leap there and stated something as fact that is not fact.
We'll start leaving Atlanta because we have two hospitals here left the health care
the desert in the southern third of Fulton County so it's not about a site of the hospital
abandoned in Atlanta. It's about providing access to health care to one-third of our county
that was left behind when the well-star made its move. And so a hospital in South Fulton County
would be run by a hospital corporation.
More house school of medicine would be able to train doctors there,
train health providers there, and have it as a hospital where
as a teaching hospital where doctors come and get trained and have
presidency and provide services.
So that is the vision that we need to see fulfilled for all those people in South
Fulton that right now don't even have an emergency room to go to.
So it's easy to confuse that with the Boulevard location that was posed down, but it's
a different part of the county.
That answers your question.
Yeah.
Thank you so much for being here.
