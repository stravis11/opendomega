Welcome to Cross Over Day 2022. I can't wait. I don't know about y'all. I've just had been anticipating all morning and last night. We're going to begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the Chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 22nd House District Representative Wes Cantrell. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. It's an incredible honor for me today to introduce our Chaplain. I first met him at the age of 12 years old when my family started attending the first Baptist Church of Atlanta where his father, Dr. Charles Stanley, had recently become the pastor. Our friendship grew in a rather strange way over the next few years as I dated his sister and he went on one date with each of my three sisters. But he's been a great friend to me for all of my life. Pastor Andy Stanley, he founded the North Point Community Church in 1995. Today, North Point Ministries consist of 10 churches in the Atlanta area and a network of 180 churches around the globe that collectively serve over 200,000 people weekly. A survey of U.S. pastors identified Andy as one of the 10 most influential pastors in America. He's the author of more than 20 books and his success reaches well beyond the Atlanta area with over 10 and a half million of his messages, leadership videos, YouTube videos and podcasts being accessed each month, 10 and a half million. The founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, is famous for saying a lot of times people don't know what they want until you show it to them. I've always thought of Andy Stanley as the Steve Jobs of pastors. He figured out how to build a church that people who had never been to church or had had a bad experience in church would want to attend. A lot of people didn't know they wanted to attend church until Andy created the unique model that is North Point Community Church. That's my honor today to introduce you to Pastor Andy Stanley. West, West O'Neill weren't allowed to clap in here, so I'll just imagine a ferocious clapper clapping after that fabulous introduction. Is that really a rule? That's a rule. All right, that's probably a good rule. We used to have that in church, and somehow along the way we got over that. Anyway, I know I don't have very few minutes. I only had a few minutes, but West thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much. It's so great to meet so many of you who I've known in the past and it's good to reconnect. I love our state, and you love our state, and I don't want to live anywhere else, and I can't imagine living anywhere else. I didn't, I wasn't invited to give you advice, but I'm going to give you my advice anyway, and I want to say beforehand, I've never done what you've done, I couldn't do what you do, and so I probably don't know what I'm talking about, and you have permission to talk bad about me behind my back, because I really am speaking into a vacuum, because I really don't know daily the pressure that you live with and the responsibility that you have. But I do have some unsolicited advice. As you know, organizations and states are never better, and then their leadership, and that's why you're doing what you're doing, and when leadership is divided, things aren't amazing, and you're here because you want the state of Georgia to be so amazing that the other states in the union look at Georgia and go, my goodness, what in the world have they figured out that the rest of us can't seem to figure out? And the win is for Georgia to be amazing, and Georgia is wonderful, but maybe Georgia could be amazing. Well, leadership has divided things aren't amazing, things never go as good as they could. Disagreement is unavoidable, you've heard this before. Disagreement is unavoidable, but division is always a choice, and the state that figures that out is going to be amazing. Division creates complexity, complexity creates inefficiency, inefficiency creates uncertainty, uncertainty drives people to their what's in it for me, corners. Now, unfortunately in your world there are advantages to division. You can raise more money when things are divided. You can be sure that the politically speaking, somebody clapped at that. You're not supposed to clap in here, that's the only rule they told me. You can raise more money when people are divided and sure that the other group is out to get them, but politically speaking, fear of the other party is an asset. Division makes it easy to demonize and mischaracterize the other folks. So unfortunately, where you sit, fear and demonization and disunity is to your advantage. What if we as a state decided we're not going to do that anymore? And you could decide that because unity is a decision. Disagreement is helpful and healthy, but disunity just makes things harder for everybody. You know that. So this is the negative part. Okay, so those of you who pander to and foster division, you are terrible leaders and let me tell you why. They're going to start clapping again in a minute. I'm afraid. Here's why I say that. If you need an enemy in order to lead your poor leader, the way I say it, the pastor is all the time, is look, I say, hey, if you want to do something different, swim to the other side of the pool, but don't kick off the wall. If you have to kick off the wall to create enough momentum to get to where you want to go, then you're doing something wrong. What if we as the leaders in the state decided we're not going to kick off the wall anymore? That we don't need an enemy in order to win and we don't need an enemy in order to lead because that is extraordinary leadership. But the problem is with challenges where you sit and with what you've been asked to do and what you feel the pressure to do, have you ever seen it done that way? Have we ever seen somebody do something extraordinary politically in a state or for a country or for a country where they didn't kick off the wall and have to leverage off an enemy? What if you just decided? You know what? We're not going to do that anymore. This is something I learned from Jesus. We said in the pastor, so I need to talk about Jesus at least once. And here it is. Jesus says, this is important. Just because somebody considers you their enemy, you do not have to return the favor. Just because somebody considers you their enemy, you do not have to take your cues from your enemies and call them or treat them like an enemy. What if we just did that? So here's my advice and I'll wrap this up real quick. I want you to resist what psychologists, psychiatrists, refer to as fundamental attribution error. Fundamental attribution error. I'd like for us to all just say that together because it's maybe the only thing we've learned today. Ready? Fundamental attribution error. Let me tell you what fundamental attribution error is in case you don't know. Fundamental attribution error is when I ascribe to you and to your behavior character issues. But when I do the same thing, I justify what I'm doing based on the fact that there were circumstantial issues. For example, when I'm late to work, it's because I was helping my wife and being good husband and a good father and it was an accident on Georgia 400. When you're late to work, I decide that you're just lazy. You don't care that you're irresponsible. You're disorganized at home and you're not really committed to the organization. That's what fundamental attribution error is. It is attributing to the other person character issues and motive issues instead of circumstantial issues. But then when we mess up and we stumble, we immediately excuse what we've done because things are busy, there's experiences going on, there's circumstances going on. In your world, it sounds like this. The corrupt Democrats and the racist Republicans. The corrupt Democrats, it's character. All of them are correct. The racist Republicans, they're all a bunch of racist. You know that's not true. What if in the state of Georgia, we just stop using that language? I mean, it may never catch on any other state. It's certainly not going to catch on in Washington DC. But what if it caught on in the state of Georgia? We gave up with clearly something wrong with these people. How can they say that? How can they support her? How can how can how can how can? Thanks to fundamental attribution error, we know the answer to the questions and it's because again, the Democrats are godless, socialist, and the Republicans are ignorant racist, right? Their actions and decisions couldn't possibly have anything to do with how they grew up, where they grew up, who they grew up around, how they were raised, and what they experienced along the way. These people aren't responding to circumstances and experiences. They have character issues. They're corrupt from within. And then one of your children or grandchildren switches parties. So they're not all racist and they're not all corrupt. Well, of course they're not. So what if what if we just stop with all that in the state of Georgia? Be better than that because you know better than that. And we let our people better than that. And when someone with and I know this is unrealistic, we can we can just dream. When someone with a microphone starts gending up the crowd with all that crap, you know, don't clap and say, a man, don't get caught up in it. Don't approve of divide him up and keep him scared leadership. Just walk out and better than walk out. Walk toward the middle because the middle is where the problems are solved. You know that. The messy middle is where the problems are solved. But to walk toward the messy middle, we all have to get out of our Republican and Democrat bucket and walk toward the middle. And that's not popular. But what if in the state of Georgia we decide it? You know what? We're not going to be political. We're going to be leaders. We're not going to be political. We're not going to be strapped into the Republican Democrat seat. And I understand this. I mean, even as a pastor believe me, I understand I am the pastor of a church indicator. And I'm the pastor of a church in Forsyth County. It's like two different countries, right? So I understand what I'm talking about. Okay. I'll come back. I'll come back some other time. Maybe if I get invited. So back to my notes, I'll wrap this up. Walk toward the middle, the messy middle where problems are solved and experiences are shared. You know, it happens in the middle and the middle, we go, oh, I didn't know that. Oh, I always thought, oh, I always assumed that's why problems are solved in the middle. Dr. King, I learned this the first time I this this donna me was when I read letters from Birmingham jail, letter from Birmingham jail, where he talked about I was going to quote it, but it's such a long quote. He talked about standing in the middle when you stand in the middle, you get shot at from both sides, but he has the statue on the mall. Just think about that. Jesus understood this, stood in the middle. Everybody wanted Jesus to be a part of their thing. Everybody still wants Jesus to be a part of their thing, right? The temple conspired against him, the empire conspired against him. There is no Roman empire and the temple hasn't been in operation since 40 years after Jesus was crucified. So this is the way forward. This is the way you change the world. And this is your opportunity and our opportunity to make this state of Georgia, not just great, I love our state, but to make it amazing. Now, I understand, but not as well as you do, it is hard to raise money in the middle. It's hard to get people angry enough to vote in the middle. It's hard to get people to turn out and vote if you've not made them afraid of their enemy in the middle. It's hard to be, you know, it's hard to do what you do if you don't play this silly game. And I just wish we would stop with, oh no, we're losing, we're losing, we're losing, if you don't support me, if you don't do this, we're going to lose. You realize in the world of politics, the goal is to always appear as if you're losing, but not to actually lose. What a terrible way to lead. What if you just, what if we just stop with all that? And when we catch each other doing that, we call each other out and we sit in the silly rallies and those things and people, you just decide, you know what, even though I'm in your party, even though I'll probably vote for you, I'm not buying it and I'm not going to respect it by clapping for it. Now to do this requires a lot of personal maturity and personal security to lead from the middle. It will require you to love our state more than you love your party. Do you love the state of Georgia more than you love your party? If not, maybe you should do something else, right? And I'm not, if you aren't we supposed to love the, I know that's why you're here. I know that's why you got into this. Again, division, you know, disagreement, it's always going to be there, but disunity, it's a choice. So you'll know which one you love more and the people around you will know which one you love more based on your willingness or unwillingness to move out of your partisan corner towards one another in the middle. I love the state of Georgia, you love the state of Georgia, it's great. Let's make it amazing. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending your son, stand in the middle between us and our sin and our perfect Heavenly Father. So with that as an example, regardless of what we believe or who we believe in or who we worship or pray to, I pray that we would have the courage to move toward each other and to listen and to love our state and to love the people in our state more than we love the categories that we've been strapped with. To give us eyes to see and ears to hear and to give us the courage because it'll take courage to follow in Jesus name. Amen. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Oh!

Glad to be the first one up today on this great day. Members, House Bill 1481 is the bill for our used car dealers. You may not know it, but dealer tags that they use are earned based on sales. In all of us know, the used car market has been upended and the number of cars available is decreased for purchase lower and they're more expensive.

So everybody will have over the bills are and go get them and read them. Chair recognizes chairman Ron Stevens to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of House I'll bring you today House Bill 1053 which is an extension of the post production film tax credit if you will. Some of you may remember you were here in 2008 whenever we really got on board to steal an industry if you will from California and that was the film industry. We are now number one of the world. Thank you for getting us there and for creating these amazing jobs that keeps your children and grandchildren who want to work in the industry here in Georgia. This post production tax credit is an extension of that that governor deal then built on this film incentive back in 2017 and that has got us where it is today. This only extends an additional five years but the most important thing that this bill does is on the back of this bill and we've been searching for a long time to get a better bang for the bug if you will for the taxpayer on this film production. So henceforth if you accept the film tax credit or if you're a writer or post production once this bill goes into effect as a condition of accepting this tax credit we the taxpayers of the state of Georgia in perpetuity will receive an income tax off of those royalty checks. We've never been able to get to door number three ladies and gentlemen until today and I hope you'll vote yes on this bill. Let's vote yes for the taxpayers and keep this industry thriving. Mr. Speaker if there's no questions I'll yield well. Do you know for questions I'll leave for a couple chair recognizes chairman Houston to your right for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker I cannot remember these tax credits transferable. Yes ma'am this one up to three years. Thank you. Yes ma'am. Do you yield for one more one more chair recognizes chairman Setsler to your right for a question. Yes sir what is the estimated value of these these royalties for perpetuity because that to me that's an interesting component. I've got some concerns about the size of the program and how we have it weighs out versus other priorities but that royalty component could be a real inducement. How much do we think that's going to be over time. Do we have any estimates for that. It's going to be massive and of course we've never really run the numbers on this but consider whenever you hit the jackpot that's kind of another bill we'll talk about. Whenever you hit the jackpot on this stuff for example once you go into syndication that's where the real money is and this keep in mind if you accept this incentive as a tax incentive for on a tax credit this is forever. So those royalty checks that come out will be sometimes large especially if those programs one that's done here in Georgia is family feud if that hits syndication and I think you can expect that those checks are from everybody from the writers all the way through to the post production. Jim and for the you yes or so just for clarity then so the income is paid out during the production of the during the productions that's where the tax could apply is there'll be no tax credit moving forward for the the the royalties that's going to get paid what we will receive those the full income tax rate in full for perpetuity. That's correct. Miss Speaker I yield well and ask you for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair here's none. The committee substitute is adopted.

Mr. Speaker that I've been pretty consistent critic of film tax credits but given the fact that we will be receiving income taxes on these participants in these deals that taxpayers of Georgia been subsidizing that I'm in favor of this bill is that not true. If the gentleman so states what purpose does chairman Carson rise. Mr. Speaker, I'm concerned to rule 133 I ask to be excused from this vote.

This bill I'm referring to the committee on health and human services that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative pro it to present the bill. Thank you speaker. The colleagues of House Bill 1404 is a simple bill that just mandates that the DCH apply for a federal waiver regarding Medicare and Medicaid. So as to make those services by IMDs which are institutions for middle disease also known as like a private psychiatric hospital that those facilities can receive federal funding through Medicaid for the services rendered. So there are a couple situations where a lot of those IMDs have emergency rooms within them people check into those emergency rooms and get long term care through that and those facilities are not able to seek compensation through Medicaid for the services rendered. So it will allow that to happen there are 30 states now that have already done this and there's about six more already in the process going through this process. We're a little late to the game on this but it will close a much needed gap and allow mental health care for middle or a lot of Georgians. That's the bill. You yield for any questions? Yes sir. Chair recognizes chairman Watson. Do you arrive for a question? Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield? Yes sir. Is this not one of the issues that we talked in some of our real development councils as we met this past summer and definitely needed to happen? Absolutely yes sir.

They have to get documentation as well by certified inspector who will inspect the home as fortified and they're certified by the insurance institute for business and home safety. It doesn't matter if it's concrete wood or steel, but if you decide to build to the fortified standard, it will require the insurance companies to recognize and honor the fortified standard and then determine on their own whether or not they would provide any information.

And I think that's something that we all ought to be interested in. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, with that, I'm happy to take any more questions. You further yield as I watch your saying. How will yield? Chair recognizes representative Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I yield. I wanted to thank you for this bill.

Chair recognizes the dean of this House. Dean Calvin Smirie to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm happy to be on the floor today and this way all this is my last crossover. House bill 1330 is the Georgia music and theater and job recovery act and I want to thank the members of this House. For considering this piece of legislation I'm going to thank my co-sponsors as well. Chairman Ron Stevens and Chairman Kasey Carpenter and Troy leader. I alluded to earlier in terms of the royalties and that in the royalties derived in this bill would be as taxable income but one of the major issues that we did was increased the tax credit. This is not a new tax credit but we did increase the tax rate from 15 to 30% for live music rehearsals and tour organizations. The major part of this bill was in House bill 718 and what we did was those tour rehearsals and organizational plays and things that nature that are in performing arts shows like the one in Columbus. We lowered the threshold which is one of the main components to build from 500,000 or half a million dollars to 100,000 so that be more compatible for a gust of the savannas, for the makings, for the Columbus Georgia to have these small theaters for them to be able to benefit on this tax credit. It also lowered the recorded music and a studio from 250,000 and recorded music scored for film and TV from 150,000. This is a great bill for the state of Georgia in terms of creating more jobs and helping out the music industry. The music industry is the same as the film industry which has been very, very beneficial to the state of Georgia and also makes Georgia more competitive with Tennessee, Oklahoma and other states that have great music industry. With that, Mr. Speaker, I like to ask your favorite consideration for House bill 1330 and the question I would be happy to entertain. You have a few questions if you're here to yield. Yes, I am. Chair recognizes representative Bentley to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Gentlemen Yeal. Yes, ma'am.

Isn't that not further true that this representative met as a younger girl. She read of representative Calvin Smiley and she's been very honored to serve with Calvin Smiley with the Fort Valley State University Foundation Board as well as in this Georgia House of Representatives. And for that reason, this representative will be voting for House bill 1330. Is that not true, Mr. Representative? Thank you very much for representing me. I appreciate that. Thank you. Do you further yield? Yes, ma'am. Chair recognizes representative Meeks to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gentlemen Yeal. Yes, ma'am. Just to make sure I did understand you correct. We didn't say in this piece of legislation that the tax credit is not transferable correct. The gentleman is correct. Thank you, sir. Thank you. It was originally in the bill but the wisdom of the Weasen Meeks Committee and I want to thank Chairman Blackman and Chairman Williamson for working with me. I served on Weasen Meeks my fifth year in the House. I was appointed a Weasen Meeks Committee and I know the work that they do. I was always told that you should see how we raise the money before you see how we spend it. And so that was my opportunity to serve in the Weasen Meeks Committee before going on the preparations committee. Do you further yield? One more, Mr. Speaker. And I know we got a long, long day. Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter to your right for a question. Mr. Gentlemen Yeal, this way in the back. Oh, low-cloud Carpenter all the way in the back. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

All right. All right. One more. What purpose does Representative Holly rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that quite possibly the sponsor of this bill is dropping this because finally when he leaves he'll be able to pursue that R&B album he meant to put together?

This bill ever for the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs that committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Ridley I'm curious is the regulation of beauty pageants is that a big issue and chance worth? So we're going to find out how big an issue it is and chance worth right? Chair recognizes representative Ridley to present the bill. Well good morning again everybody. Congratulations for to be in here for the first annual beauty pageant cleanup bill. Don't ever say you won't do anything here because you'll end up doing it. This bill if you look online 12 and 13 it's real difficult. They're adding required that beauty pageants have a internet website and an email address. So I don't have anything to do with civic organizations that this is actual companies that beauty pageant companies. And that's all the bill does and I'm sure that there's some great questions out there Mr. Speaker. And it's this time I'll take you. You didn't expect to not have questions did you? No sir I've been up all night thinking about it. You might want to stop right there. Trust me I want me to be yield for questions. Yes sir I'll yield for one. Chair recognizes representative Hagen to your right for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I'm just wondering if your purpose for bringing this bill was for many traumatic experience that you had in a beauty pageant. And if so would you share that story with us? I know you may find it hard to believe but I never won one. And like I told Chairman Smith this morning in the rules it's not hard for me to make you look good if you stand beside me. So anybody could win. Mr. Speaker if there's no other thing. You're further you. Yes sir I'll yield for him. Chair recognizes representative Anolowicz to your left for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that once you did indeed win $10 for second prize in a beauty contest during a game of monopoly? That would be true. I think that was right after you got me out of jail for 200. Do not pass out. Mr. Speaker if there's no other questions about this legislation. I know the hour is early. It's time for lunch.

House Bill 1496 will allow sheriff in possession of impounded or unplanned livestock to donate the animal to a rescue group or an individual in addition to being able to auction it or euthanize it. So this bill does happy to answer any questions. Is that it? Yes, sir, that's it. Do you have no questions? I yielded well. Thank you so much. Is there a way, ma'am? Is that a question? Do you do that a question? Do you yield? Let's do that. Yes, sir. I yield. Chair recognizes representative Dunahoo for a question to your left. I'm a good friend to you, will you? Do I will? You will, the yield. I will yield the yield to you, yes, sir. Thank you. Did not we hear this in committee four or five times? No, sir, not this bill. We didn't. That I'm aware of.

Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1435. House Bill 1435, our room is in the 19th and others will be titled an act to amend subpar 2A, Part 3 of Article 7, Chapter 3, Title 20. The official go to Georgia, annotated, relating the needs-based financial aid program, and also to include eligibility for students with a financial aid gap. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Higher Education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You were looking up at the clock there. I didn't know how quick I needed to be. Now I see what's going on up there. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for giving me attention today to bring you a bill that can be very important across the state of Georgia. I want to thank the University System of Georgia, Technical College System, and Georgia Student Finance for working with us to put this together in addition to Governor Kimpin, his office. Georgia State University does a great job with us. Valdosta State does, and a number of other institutions. What we seek to do in this legislation is to help eligible students who have a financial gap, a small gap to get across the finish line to finish their certificate or their degree program with a grant of up to $2,500. We all know that in this economy and in economy's past, just getting to finish, allows people to get into the economy and pay back any other debt they have, and failing to do that, it leaves them in a position that is probably the worst possible thing that is with college debt and without the degree or without the certification. This is subject to appropriations, but we've talked to the Governor's office and we've identified money that can travel in the next budget to provide for this program up to $10 million. Again, this is for eligible students. One of the requirements I had been asking, I want to highlight, is they would all have to complete the federal student aid form to make sure that they had exhausted other opportunities for fast-fa funding. We left some of that on the table in this past year, our students do that, so we're going to do a better job of showing them access to that. Another important thing to note here is all of our institutions and hope eligible private college, not for profit institutions, are part of this program and each, it can be customized to each individual student population. This enables each university to look at their state of population and provides the needs necessary. Given that, we will need to fine tune that, so I draw your attention to lines 87-392, which allows the commission to seek data and provide reporting back to this body and to the Senate as we go forward. I would note that this is being sunset on June 30, 2025. If it's working, clearly the body would extend it, but if it's not, we want to refine it and make it better. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'd ask the House's favorable consideration. I think this is a big step for Georgia as this body, the Governor's Office, and hopefully our friends in the Senate can make a commitment to help people across the finish line, help our students get that certification and that degree. I think we've been working on a big step in that degree and become part of our Georgia economy. If there are questions, I'll try to... I do, yes sir. Chair recognizes representative McLeod to your left for a question. Yes Sir. That's a gentleman's yield. Absolutely. So right now the money that's allocated in this legislation, you would be looking at just about roughly how many students after they've exhausted fast. How many students are you thinking that we would be able to cover on to this? Well, my math would say if everybody used the $2500 $10 million, we'd go $4,000, am I right on the math? And that is if everyone needed the full $2500, we're hearing stories from students that they're in the last semester and something that was crazy, they lose their daycare or something that, you know, what this would do is pay their tuition so they could use the money to pay their daycare. To be clear, the money in this grant goes to the institution, not to the student, so it would pay the tuition so then they could take care of other things. But it could help as many as $4,000, it could help twice that many if the needs were smaller. I really want to thank you for bringing this bill. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, I do have one more. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I mean, this is an important measure. If it's a question about the technical issues in the bill, I want to make sure I answer it. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Dubnik to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman here. Yes. Mr. Speaker, could you explain how this $10 million would be allocated to the 26 USG institutions in our technical college system? I think the gentleman for his question. We have left that open to the student finance to the technical college system and to the university. The idea being that it would be allocated based on the students needs based in their, let me say this, needs based and with a gap needed into their student population, but we're still working on that to be honest. This has to be, and I'm a very objective person in answering your question, we like to send things out of here with specific rules and regulations. This is a place where we have to be flexible in order to, and we have to be flexible in trust in our institutions and the counselors at these colleges to get this in the right spot and to put the money there. That's why we have the reporting and that's why we have the sunset so that we can fact check it in three years and refine it and make it better. But the idea is it would be divided amongst the institutions based on their student population in need. Thank you, gentleman, for the question. With that, I'll yield the well and ask for the House favourable consideration on HB 1435. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have another member who wishes to speak to the bill. The chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon. I rise in enthusiastic support for House Bill 1435. I whole, wholeheartedly support the bill and I'm very excited that we get a chance to vote on it today. Higher education changes lives. It's as simple as that. We have the more kids that we can get into our higher education system, the better they are going to be, the better their families are going to be, the next generations in our whole state. This is a wonderful day. I also want to just point out, this makes good business sense. Every year, one of the largest expenditures we make is to education generally and also specifically to our higher education system. So we are paying part of what gets our students through our higher education system and the idea that $500, $1,000 or $2,500 might keep somebody from graduating after they've already spent four years investing and we've already spent four years investing as a tragedy because they lose their investment and so do we and the state never benefits from that money that we've already spent. So I hope you'll join me in an enthusiastic yes vote for House Bill 1435.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The Report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Yes, so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1435. The eyes are 171. The nasor 3, this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1461. House Bill 1461, Madam Chair, Anderson, the 10th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 36 and title 36, the fiscal to Georgia-antid relating annexation of territory. So if there are revised provisions related to dispute resolution, this bill will have further committee on governmental affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Anderson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring before you today House Bill 1461. The last time I was in the well, I had mentioned the study committee we did out of session on annexation and cityhood and this is another bill out of that. This bill implements many of the recommendations that came out of our study committee and has substantive improvements to the process. This is also possibly the only annexation related bill with substantive improvements that you'll see come through here that has both GMA and ACCG support. House Bill 1461 implements recommendations from the study committee on annexation and cityhood regarding timelines, deadlines, delivery methods for reporting, arbitration panel results, access to court reporters and hearing officers, allow virtual and teleconference meetings, equally sharing arbitration costs, reporting of arbitration and agreement results, and extending the binding time for panel imposed conditions. I would ask for your favorable consideration and we'll yield for any questions if there are some. We have no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1461, the eyes are 172. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1479. House Bill 1479, I represent the court, the 174th and others to be titled, act to amend part two of Article 1 and chapter 6 and title 12. The official go to Georgia and Antietta, really, the practice of professional forestry, so it's to provide that the state board of registration for foresters is an independent state agency attached to the state forestry commission for administrative purposes only. House Bill I've referred to the committee on natural resources and environment. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Corvitt to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'll bring before you, House Bill 1479. Presently the Georgia Board of Registration for Foresters resides with the Secretary of State's Office under the Professional License Board. The Board serves as the professional license body for foresters. It's charged with protecting the public health, safety and welfare by regulating those who engage in the practice of professional forestry. Many foresters have expressed deep frustration with the lack of responsiveness, support, and communication from the Board staff. And the low level of support provided by the Board staff and addressing and investigating complaints lodged to the Board. These issues are of concern as it clearly creates an issue of public welfare. So what we're doing with 1479, we would relocate the operation, function, and revenue generated by the Georgia Board of Registration for foresters from the Georgia Secretary of State's Professional License Board to the Forestry Commission. I have spoken with Tim Lauer more of our forestry director. He is confident that they have the knowledge and capacity to successfully implement what's in 1479. And I would ask for everybody's favor consideration because it's definitely a better fit and we'd be better served. So I'll yield for any questions if they already miss speaking. And maybe not. Is it you good? You have no questions? Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. As opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1479. The eyes are 174, the nasors 0. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1484. House Bill 1484, by the way, Representative Hawkins, the 27th and others to be entitled to amend Article 7th, Chapter 4, Title 49. The official go to Georgia, annotated, relating to medical assistance generally serves to provide for a three-year pilot program to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders. This bill having further committee on health and human services, that committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you just heard, this bill addresses a serious condition that we have been seeing in our children in Georgia, our committee on health and human services. Over the years, we've been here in testimony. In fact, in 2019, we had a study committee on this. Some of our mothers and children come in and testify. This bill provides coverage for diagnosis and treatment of 100 up to 100 children through the state health benefit plan, four pans, which is a pediatric autoimmune neuropsychotic disorder associated also sometimes with strap infections. We heard very good testimony from a number of experts, Dr. Sue Tonsuedo from the National Institute of Mental Health on this issue. We have the opportunity to lead the nation in the research and treatment of this disease, so I would ask your fable consideration, and if there's no questions, I will yield the well. You have no questions? Gentlemen, as yielded the well, Chair recognizes Representative Bennett to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and to my colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I rise an enthusiastic support for this bill. Pans and pandas has been a curiosity, however, it is an opportunity for Georgia to be a leader in diagnosis and treatment as the chairman has said. There are so many thousands and thousands of people in family suffering in Georgia today, as it goes without diagnosis and therefore it delays treatment. This disease can sometimes mimic as a mental health disorder, presenting itself with children and with OCD ticks eating disorders, and sometimes it even leads to suicide. So I would ask your favorable support, and I want to thank the chairman, Chairman Hawkins, I want to thank Chairman Gravley, I want to thank Chairman Cooper for their enthusiastic support of this condition called Pans and Pandas, and you can always remember the PANDA. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Moore to speak to the bill. Good evening, colleagues. I know today is long, so I will make my comments short. I just wanted to put a face to this little known disease that we are talking about today. If you look at the board, this is my beautiful niece Alexis from Roswell, Georgia, who during the past two years developed PANs, otherwise known as pediatric onset, pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome. In six months time, Alexis has had 10 hospital visits, eight hospital admissions, 50 doctor visits, she had to be withdrawn from school to Lumbar punctures, over 90 vows of blood taken, $80,000 in out of pocket costs. You see, a few years ago, Alexis started experiencing OCD, anxiety, and depression. At age 14, almost overnight, she began to develop motor ticks and verbal ticks, much like Tourette. Almost all of her doctors kept blaming it on anxiety and refused to even do blood work despite her mother's insistence on it being PANs. Alexis began to exhibit Coprolalia, which is a word I had to look up. It means motor ticks of profanity. The family could not leave the house with her out of fear of what she might say. She had punching ticks that almost broke her hand and kicking ticks that almost broke her toes. One day, she woke up dyslexic and disc graphic. She began experiencing seizures, almost one per minute, for up to 12 hours. The medical specialist did not recognize these symptoms and had no answers. Her mother risked being dismissed by doctors at a certain children's medical facility if she even mentioned PANs. Alexis had active infections in her body that crossed her blood brain barrier. There's plenty of data to show that these same infections can cause severe damage to the brain and central nervous system. Yet doctors dismissed her illness to her face, telling Alexis that it was all in her head. Both viruses like strep, herpes, mono, parvo, and many others can cross the blood brain barrier, causing inflammation of parts of the brain. Her body gets confused and attacks her brain when she gets exposed to viruses. Doctors now acknowledge that COVID can cause this as well. It is time for PANs to be widely accepted and that this has been happening with other infections for years. However, Alexis is lucky her family had the financial resources to keep fighting. She found a doctor who specializes in PANs. The treatment for PANs costs them $15,000 a month. After three treatments, Alexis no longer had anxiety, depression, OCD, dyslexia, or dysgraphia. Eight months later, she has not had a seizure in three months. It is incredibly important that we fight for medical communities to recognize PANs as a legitimate disease so that insurance companies will begin to pay for the treatments of this much like my beautiful niece Alexis had to undergo. Thank you for supporting this bill. Thank you for the chairman for bringing it and thank you all for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Maynard rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that when I read, once you get COVID, one of the possibilities is getting panned and that's exactly why I keep wearing my mask because I don't want it. If the lady so states, I know she's knowledgeable about those issues. What purpose does representative Bennett rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State to inquiry. Isn't that true that when I thanked those supporters of the bill, I neglected to thank our chairman Smith who had rules, our rules committee chairman who has a personal interest in panns. Thank you. Isn't- Thank you for doing that. Well, purpose is representative dryer rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the first time we did a morning order on panns and pannes about three years ago, the former rules chair chairman Meadows came and tapped me on the shoulder and said, my family's been affected by that. Thank you for bringing this issue. I believe that to be correct. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1484. The eyes are 172. The nays are zero this bill. Having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1528. House Bill 1528, by the way, will be titled to amend Article 14 to Chapter 1 and Title 10. The official go to Georgia and annotate it relating to secondary medical recycle so to survive that should be illegal. Preserved persons to purchase, possess, obtain, or sell or attempt to purchase, possess, obtain, or sell. Detached, catalytic, converters. This bill I refer to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that dispelled do pass. Chair recognizes representative Mom to hand to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, today I frame before you House Bill 1528. House Bill 1528 creates new penalties for criminals that are still in catalytic converters off of vehicles by laying under the vehicle and using a size aisle to remove the catalytic converter. The process to steal a catalytic converter can just take mere minutes. The reason for the theft is to scrap the metal for the precious metals that are inside of these catalytic converters. Like I said, the depot saw them off in a grocery store, mall, or even a home depot parking line. They take dozens of these catalytic converters to out of state recyclers that don't have as tough as life as the state of Georgia has. They get anywhere between $25 to $100 for these catalytic converters. The cost to the insurance companies and to consumers can be $2,000 or even $4,000 for each one of these converters. In fact, just this week, a member of this body has had their catalytic converter stolen off of their vehicle in the parking lot at their apartment. So it's a big issue, something that we need to address. This bill will take charges for each converter that the criminal has in their possession and a last-line enforcement post-conviction forfeiture if their property was used to commit the crime. Mr. Speaker, that is House Bill 1528 and I'm happy to take one question because I know I stand between us and lunch. Did you yield? A yield. Chair recognizes Representative Pruitt for a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is there a yield? Yes, sir. Well, this bill not helped me in that situation last night or this yesterday morning when I woke and found that my Toyota Tundra sounded like a Harley-Davison when I went to start it. And after further inspection, I found that my catalytic converter had been sawed off overnight. And I took it to the dealership and the Toyota dealership said it's about $4,500 to repair that. And additionally, the service department said that they experienced this about 15 to 20 times a month just at that one Toyota dealership. So this is probably a rampant across the state. Thank you for bringing it. That's right. This bill would address that problem. It's rampant not only in Metro Atlanta, but all across our great state. Mr. Speaker, without I'm going to yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. The one has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The chair here is none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does the minority caucus whip for the legislative Wilkerson rise? Parliament to inquiry? Picture inquiry. Is it not true that the way this bill is currently written that if someone steals a catalytic converter they can seize the car that was used. However, if they steal the whole car, then they cannot seize the car that was used. Is that accurate? The way the bill is currently written? I'm not sure I followed you, but I'm sure the members of the body did. You're a little too poetic for me there, Representative. What purpose does Representative McLauren rise? Parliamentary increments. Statue inquiry. This speaker isn't not true that we already have laws on the books that make felony theft over $1,500, like I said, a felony. And isn't it true that there's no evidence that stacking offenses and building in more penalties despite the harms that these crimes cause will do anything substantively to address the underlying causes of the crimes? Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? Well, I think a reasonable people can reach different conclusions on that issue. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. From the passage of House Bill 1528, the eyes are 134. The nays are 37. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Rules Committee for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The House Rules Committee will meet at 2 o'clock today in room 341. 2 o'clock. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for an announcement. She waves. Chair recognizes Chairman Billy Mitchell for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Democratic Caucus will meet live in room 216, where lunch will be served. Once again, that's 216 upon the chairman here, upon the break for lunch in the meeting. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Kenan for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, members, there will be students here from the Atlanta University Center commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the AUC sit-in about economic justice. I would just ask that you reach out and say hello to some of these talented young people who will be here today around 2.30 p.m. Thank you. That completes our announcements. This House will be in recess for lunch until 215. 215.
