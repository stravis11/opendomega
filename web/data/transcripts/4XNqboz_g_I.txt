Yes, sir.
Yes sir, y'all stay with me please.
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the day, Lord.
We thank you for loving us.
We thank you for the gift of salvation, Lord.
And we thank you to be allowed to do the work of the people.
As we go about this meeting, Lord, we just ask that you be with us.
We ask, Lord, that you give us wisdom and discernment.
and we pray. Amen.
Thank you, sir.
Only have one bill on our agenda today.
And this was from Senator Harbin.
He couldn't be here this morning,
so I'm just going to present the bill from here for him,
because this is hearing only,
because it's going to require an actuary.
This is Senate Bill 308, LC 43 2708.
Last year, the General Assembly approved an increase from $20 to $50 a month in retirement
benefits for current members of the General Assembly upon their retirement.
Senate Bill 308 extends this increase for those members who had already retired when
the change went into effect. If a member served one year, they would receive $600 a year
in retirement benefits. If a member served 10 years, they would receive $6,000 a year
in benefits. Any questions, any comments on the bill? Anybody want to talk about any
you all from out there. Yes ma'am. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Well we look at this
and I think the bill that passed last year at the last minute the retirees were deleted
but I think they are very deserving of this retirement. Yes ma'am. Thank you. Anybody have
comments or questions? Seeing none, we'll move this bill for actuary. We don't need
a vote on it, I don't think. And do we? We do need a vote to move it on.
I move that we pass this on to actuary.
thank you so we have a motion second thank you in a discussion hearing none all
in favor say aye any opposed so carry any other business to come before this
Committee.
Eric Nam will stand adjourned.
