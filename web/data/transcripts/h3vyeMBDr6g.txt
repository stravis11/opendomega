He's a chaplain for the Army National Guard and He's also a chaplain for the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office He is a self-professed history and English nerd and he teaches at the college level and he's done that at many colleges But currently teaches at the University of West Georgia He's married has two kids one grand kid and I won't take up any more time. Please meet Colonel Reverend Pertle Good morning everybody. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you briefly. I just wanted to Speak to you on the theme of victory Regardless of your lane. I'm probably Confident in saying that you are concerned with victory from your lane I want to read a text to you from the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 20 verses 1 3 4 this is what the word of the Lord says there When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own You shall not be afraid of them For the Lord your God is with you who brought you up out of the land of Egypt And when you draw near to the battle the priest shall come forward and speak to the people and say to them here Oh Israel today you are drawing near for battle against your enemies Let not your heart faint Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them for the Lord your God is He who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory To give you the victory Two questions for you this morning What's your initial reaction or gut instinct when you have a battle on your hands? And secondly, what does scripture say about where the Christians reliance should be? In the passage above from Deuteronomy chapter 20 God is instructing the leader of the people the shepherd the pastor if you will Moses and He's instructing Moses about the theme of warfare And upon what footing and what grounding we should enter in the combat God knows all things and he knows all people through and through But God teaches Moses some fundamentals about whom and what to rely upon when facing battles and First one of that text from Deuteronomy 20 the first thing that God instructs Moses is fear not Fear not you shall not be afraid of them The second thing that Moses says there or that God says to Moses God teaches Moses why he is not to fear it comes right there in verse 1 for the Lord your God is with you I would assume in your lane that you may enter these halls Some days and you might never express it verbally, but you might think What ground am I standing upon what is a sure footing? Don't ever forget if you're a believer the Lord your God is with you Third thing that God instructs Moses there is he says it is God who grants the victory Verse 4 says for the Lord your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory So if I could just leave you with one thought this morning. I have no idea where each of you is in terms of your spiritual State but I know wherever you are Spiritual warfare is inevitable and the new in the new covenant and the new testament letter of Ephesians Paul writes this For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood But against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers over the present darkness Against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places But if you are in Christ Victory belongs to the Lord Keep short accounts with the Lord Work hard and trust God with the results Is it okay if I pray for you? I Father, I thank you for the opportunity to be your minister for your gospel no moralism no secular humanism No system exists that reconciles us sinners to you But only through the personal work of Christ Jesus there is hope Lord, I lift these your servants before you today and in the days to come and I pray that you shape them With acute minds and characters that reflect the image of God that they all bear again I thank you for this time. I pray for Christ glory. Amen You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You It is always a pleasure to have and recognize our doctors of the day We have another very special physician here today and always glad to have Each and every one that will come and volunteer their time to introduce our doctor of the day I'll recognize the senator from the 14th to introduce our doctor of the day Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning from the medical capital, Georgia, Senate District 14 I'm honored once again today to introduce our doctor of the day. Today's doctor is Dr. Kristen Higgins. She is the chief clinical officer at the City of Hope Cancer Center, Atlanta located in Newden. She is a radiation oncologist Who did her training in Durham Duke University Medical Center She in her own words a kind of doctor you don't want to see but hopefully she will be able to handle any of your Broken odds and ends today down in the capital clinic on the second floor and we hope that's not necessary. Please help me welcome Dr. Kristen Higgins to the Capitol Thank you all so much. It's a real honor to be here and I just wanted to thank you for everything that you do Working on all of the legislation for the people of Georgia and really helping us to be as healthy as we can be and have the best health outcomes That's near and dear to my heart. So just thank you for all of your hard work. It does not go unnoticed and please come visit me in the first aid station If you have any symptoms at all so happy to be here You You You We have some very special guests from Choa here today secretary read the resolution Senate resolution 642 by senators parent of the 44th and others a resolution recognizing February 7th through the 14th 2026 as congenital heart defect awareness week at the state Capitol and for other purposes whereas over 1 million families across America face the challenges and hardships of raising children with congenital heart defense Each year approximately 40,000 babies are born in the United States with these conditions and now therefore be resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize February 7th through the 14th 2026 as congenital heart defect awareness week at the state Capitol Mr. President that police you order Is there objections adoption resolution chair here's nine adoption and the resolution is adopted We're going to have a senator from the 44th to speak to the resolution Thank you Mr. President. It is my true honor to present the resolution to recognize this week as congenital heart defect awareness week at the Capitol We have a whole monopoly of very special guests up here with me today We've got a hope and will children's health care of Atlanta's beloved mascots Recognizable to all of us we also have two of our Therapy Dogs who you can't really see right now, which I'm struggling with because I want you to be able to see them during the presentation But they'll come back around and they do such a great job some other representatives from Choa and from the Heart Association and most special we have the five members of the Hudson family Mark warriors Joy Royal and Saint And baby Joel Joel is 22 months old and was diagnosed at Wall young obviously with a C a V V This means this is a congenital heart defect and it means that her heart has one large shared valve Instead of two separate ones Joy else condition impacts one in every 15,000 to 17,000 births each year As a matter of fact heart defects are the most common birth defects In the United States Effecting for approximately 40,000 Babies born each year These conditions vary in type and severity There could be a small hole between the two upper chambers of the heart or a hole between the two lower chambers Each of those conditions would prevent proper blood flow throughout the body or perhaps someone could be born with a Connection between the two major arteries of the heart that does not close after birth There are many others Some of these congenital heart defects are diagnosed at birth but many others are not and if undiagnosed could lead to cases of sudden cardiac death Especially in young athletes And despite all of the alarming statistics and that this is the most common birth defects in our country Newborns and young athletes are not regularly screened for heart defects This Congenital heart defects are very near and dear to my heart in particular One of my beloved aunts, my Aunt Mary Ann, who we called Aunt Mouse, she passed away a few weeks ago

Due to heart failure from her congenital heart defect, she was not diagnosed until she was about 20 years old. She collapsed at a dance and had to be rushed to the hospital. And that's when her congenital heart defect was discovered. She, when her death occurred a few weeks ago, she was 78 years old. So she really was a miracle of modern medicine. But it was a battle for her entire life. And as she grew older, her malfunctioning heart led her to have to be frequently in the hospital for severe atrial fibrillation. And her failure of her heart to pump blood efficiently meant that fluid would have severe build up in her body. And her feet, for example, would be swollen and red because her heart simply could not pump her blood through her body. But she was one of the lucky ones. And there are so many like Joyelle, like young athletes who may collapse at fall football, pre-training season that we often read about, who are not as lucky. And we need to have more work to do to help all of these patients. My aunt's story actually has a really wonderful silver lining. Not for this condition, she may never have met my uncle. He was a hospital orderly when at 20, she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. He said, oh, this new patient who came in is pretty cute. And that was it. And they were married for 55 years. Yeah. So, loving care go a long way. But we can do better as a body to try to catch and prevent congenital heart defects. The life-long care needed for these patients is also a reason that I have filed SB481, which would cover heart and lung transplants under Medicaid. We're actually the only state that has the capabilities to do those transplants where they are not covered under Medicaid. And this is a bipartisan issue that many are talking about and that I'm working on with Piedmont, Emery, and the Medical Association of Georgia. So just putting in a plug for that while we talk about these defects, I really want to thank the Hudson family and all the other advocates who are up here. We've got some other young patients. Please give them a round of applause. Yeah. Yay! Hi! You are all here. Yeah, if you all haven't looked at this little cutie who's standing up and waving at you, you really have to. She's a firecracker, clearly. Thank you for coming and educating us. And thank you to all of these special guests and always to Children's Health Caravillana, which does a tremendous job. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. you you you we have some more very special guests here today and to I'll say take, read the resolution and I'll introduce the senator to your introduce our friends here. Senator resolutions 640 by Senator's Ginn of the 47th and others, a resolution recognizing family and consumer sciences and for other purposes. Whereas family and consumer sciences is a comprehensive body of research, knowledge, and skills and helps make people make informed decisions about their well-being, relationships and resources to achieve their optimal quality of life. And whereas, family and consumer science professionals with unique focus on families work and their interrelationships. Empower individuals and families to manage the challenges of living and working in a diverse global society. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize the affiliates, communities, and other entities within family and consumer sciences and support and facilitate the development of implementation of national, state, and local intervention strategies to sustain family and consumer sciences in the current and economic education environment. Mr. President, that police you order. Is there objection to the adoption resolution chair? Here's none. The resolution is adopted. Recognize the center from the 47th. Introduce our friend. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You know, I look over here at my president and it's always great to be a bulldog. You know, and it's even better today to be where I've got a whole platform for folks that are all good bulldogs from the University of Georgia, family and consumer science. Today, we want to honor their service to Georgia and what it means, because you know, you can look at me and I can look at y'all and I know that we all like to eat. We all like to eat healthy. We like to eat economical. We like to live well. And that's what facts is all about. And to me, I can tell you a little bit of personal side of things. As a 1949 graduate of the University of Georgia College of Home Economics, my mom was a predecessor to what we today call facts. I'm gonna call on Dr. Allison Pinn to introduce our platform guest and talk a little bit about what's going on at the University of Georgia Facts program. But before I do, I've got one facts dooted up here. I'm gonna ask her to step forward. Said I want everybody here to recognize Bella Brim. Bella is a fact student today. She'll be graduating this semester, or to end of this semester. The, she's from Dawson, Georgia and she's what makes our office tick. The, it's great to have, I think she's my 16th fact student up here to Capitol. And it's great to have Bella here with us. But I wanted to introduce y'all to her and y'all to her and her to y'all. So, Dr. Pinn said, then I'm gonna let you come on up here and speak a little bit to the resolution. But let's give them a warm welcome at a go-do! Ha ha! So, good morning. Good morning. On behalf of the family and consumer sciences profession, which includes our Georgia family and consumer sciences teachers, students in high school and college, and other representatives of family and consumer sciences. Thank you, senators and Senator Ginn and Senator Calder as well. Thank you, Senator Calder and President Jones for recognizing today as family and consumer sciences day. We are extremely proud of this profession. And I do wanna take advantage of the opportunity to introduce the individuals who are behind me. So, I would like to introduce Dr. Carmen Peterson to the University of Georgia. She is representing the Georgia Association of Family and Consumer Sciences. Kayla Hartline, who is up there in Chautuca County, who is representing the Georgia Association of Family and Consumer Sciences. And Jalika Bridges, one of my very own family and consumer sciences agent, who is an extension agent in Bartow County. And Julie Patterson, who is representing also representing the Georgia Association of Family and Consumer Sciences. And it is with the University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences. So, as Senator Ginn alluded, we make a difference in family and consumer sciences in the lives of people across this state. We train the workforce and we educate individuals about how to lead a better life and how to make better decisions so that they have a good quality of life. We educate individuals about health, about finance, about consumer economics, about human development across the lifespan, about how to raise their children, how to be good parents, how to feed their family well. And we do this through a profession that is broadly stretched across the state of Georgia. It is our pleasure and our honor to be represented and represented with you today and to have the opportunity to enjoy the recognition that you all provide us by proclaiming today family and consumer sciences day. Thank you very much for this privilege. I do also want to recognize our family and consumer sciences intern Bella, who has done an amazing job today. Thank you very much for the honor. Thank you.

And whereas these brave law enforcement leaders provide public service above and beyond the call of duty, often at great personal risk and tremendous sacrifice, not only to themselves, but also to their families.

A resolution recognizing February 11th, 2026 as National Guard Day at the State Capitol and for other purposes.

And whereas the Georgia Department of Defense consists of more than 11,600 Army National Guard soldiers, 2,900 Air National Guardmen, 500 state defense force volunteers and nearly 500 state employees. And now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize February 11th, 2026 as National Guard Day at the State Capitol and commend the men and women of the Georgia National Guard for their strength, leadership, courage and selfless service. Mr. President, that completes your order. He is the objections to adoption of resolution. Chair here's none. The resolution is adopted. We're going to have Senator from the 54th to introduce our special guest. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, family. Today is a very special day to have these fine folks with us. The best of our state has to offer or hear with us today. Today we are here. I've done a resolution. We are to honor the Georgia National, the Army National Guard, the Georgia Air National Guard and the Georgia State Defense Force. Without these entities, it's not just a state issue, but a national issue and an international issue. Because since 2001, September 11th, 2001, more than 35,000 soldiers and airmen have been deployed around the world to our nation's defense. And it's my honor to introduce Major General Wilson. And he's going to introduce the folks he has with. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah. Hey, well, good morning. Lieutenant Governor sir, thank you as well, members of the Senate. Just thanks a ton for allowing us to be here. I've got the entire team with me. So the deputy, Adjunion General, Mr. Joe Ferreiro, Jason Froman, who commands the Georgia Army National Guard. Chief Dent is our senior enlisted advisor for the Georgia Air National Guard and then Tony Dill, Colonel Tony Dill, retired Army Special Forces Colonel who we get back into our state defense force and Tony does a great job with those folks. We've got the whole team here with us and we're excited to be here. So these guys never brag on themselves. I'm going to ask you just to bear with me for a few minutes because I'm going to brag on them and the folks that we have in the stands for just a few minutes. Again, excited to be here. I'm honored to be able to get up here and just share a little bit with you. Most importantly, I want to just highlight some of the accomplishments of the 15,000 men and women that make up the Georgia Army National Guard, the Georgia Air National Guard, volunteers from our Georgia State Defense Force, our federal and state civilian employees, all the folks that just make up the team. These men and women selflessly serve our state and our nation and they do it all over the world, both at home and abroad and they do it with distinction and with courage. Now I'm a little biased but we have the best national guard out of the 54 states, territories and the district of Columbia. The leader standing here with me this morning routinely receive national level recognition. Recently the Georgia Army National Guard was selected as 2025's best national guard headquarters by the association of the United States Army. It's okay to clap. It's a big deal for these guys. Yeah. You're Army National Guard won that award for 2025. Additionally, the Georgia Air National Guard has received the Air and Space Force operational excellence award for the last three out of five years and that's certainly a big deal as well. As the primary combat reserve of both the Army and the Air Force were more globally engaged than ever. As I stand here this morning we have soldiers and airmen that are all over the world. They're in every geographic combatant command not only protecting our own vital interests, our national interests, but assisting our partners and our allies with additional security in places like Europe, South America, Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and then right here in the United States. We've got folks today helping out along our southern border and then providing additional security at our nation's capital. But that's not all that this team does. The unique to the national guard is our ability to respond at the direction of the governor when we're needed right here at home. Just two weeks ago we assisted our local communities and state partners during winter storm, Fern, primarily focused on some counties up in the northeastern part of the state. But the team just did a great job helping out. Two years ago these same men and women played a critical role in the state's response and recovery efforts during Hurricane Debbie, Helene and Milton working side to side with first responders and our county and state partners. Some of the teammates that have been involved in all of this deploying around the world or helping out right here some of them are with us here this morning. I'm going to embarrass them a little bit. I'm going to ask them to stand. Some of them are in the balconies up there above us. Please stand and then I would ask you all to please join me in just recognizing them for their unparalleled service and sacrifice to our state and our nation. Please stand. I'm happy to report to you this morning too. It's not happening every state but I'm happy to report to you that your national guard is fully manned, the Georgia Army National Guard finished 2025. It almost 140% of the mission that was given to them by the National Guard. It's been more recruits into our formations than any other state did out of the 54. At the same time the Georgia Air National Guard had their strongest recruiting year and two and a half decades. Strongest recruiting year and 25 years. Both General Froman and Major General Crumble who couldn't be here today. They're doing all of this while continuing to successfully transform their formations to meet emerging missions and requirements. We continue the Georgia National Guard continues to be selected to receive new force structure as both the Army and the Air Force execute the largest transformation and modernization efforts in almost 40 years. And just like Governor Camp and you all just like you all have worked tirelessly to make Georgia the best state in the nation to do business. We're working hard to make Georgia and the Georgia National Guard the best place for new missions and new opportunities for our soldiers and our airmen. These new units will give our state added capability and added capacity for the joint force and for stuff that might happen right here at home. They'll keep the Georgia National Guard at the forefront of readiness, modernization and lethality for decades to come. Finally, because of the actions of this legislative body, because of the actions of you all through the years, we've been able to successfully renovate and modernize lots of our facilities, lots of our armories across the state. Most of these facilities were constructed in the 1950s and the 1960s. This very much needed initiative which was made possible with the sport of Governor Camp. And again, you all, it allows us to combine state and federal funds to match them to complete all of these projects. That's at the end of this year, at the end of 2026, six years into this initiative. We're going to complete renovations on 30 of our armories. We're also working closely with our local and state leaders, some of you in here this morning to explore the possibility of building brand new armories in our state as well. Where these opportunities, when and where these opportunities show themselves. So thank you all for your continued support with both of these efforts. And closing is certainly not lost on us that one of the most important components of our continued success, though, is you all. It's the support that we get from this body. It's the support that we get from the citizens of this great state. So thank you for all that you're doing and all that I know that you're going to continue to do for our soldiers, our airmen, their families and the civilians that make up our team. As we navigate 2026, I want you to just rest assured that we're well equipped. Your National Guard is well equipped to successfully meet any challenge that lies ahead. The Georgians should continue to take great pride in knowing that the Georgian National Guard is always ready and always there. Thank you so much for giving me a few minutes this morning. you you you you you we're going to have center from the 15th. And as far unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 50th. That object is in center from the 50th is excuse. Thank you senator. Are they any unanimous consent? It is time for the points to personal privilege.

But when I heard that they were here today, I was like, well, we need to recognize them here. So, Senator from 29th, come on up. We got very special guests. Our folks, our friends with Kia are here today. Let's give Kia a big round of applause here for being here today. So, I know we have their leadership here. We have the former St. Congressman Drew Ferguson, this year today. So, he was smart. He got out of politics. And so, but anyways, I'm going to call on the Senator from the 29th and to introduce our special guests. Colleagues, when we talk about creating jobs in Georgia, and when we talk about Kia, when he's not talking about jobs, we're talking about generational impact on the state of Georgia. And I'm so proud to represent this great company and the thousands of men and women that it employs. And I'm honored to introduce to you Mr. Stewart-Countis, the CEO of Kia. Thank you, Senator. I want to say thank you from Kia. You guys, who've been great supporters. We've now been in existence 19 years and been producing cars in the state of Georgia. Just a small point, we made our 5th millionth car last week, which is a great accomplishment for any auto company, but certainly all of those were built by Georgia. So thank you. I recognize the Senator from Chris County. Step up on this thing right here. Look at these old folks here. Good morning, everyone. I want you all to meet Carter Jane Smith. I want you to tell you a little bit about this young lady here. She is from Chris County and today, Chris County is having a function for everybody in the blue room at 5 p.m. If you'll notice on your desk, you got some pecans and they'll be serving food and telling you all about the things that the legislature does for Chris County. So while we're here here, Ms. Carter, this little young lady here, here's her story. Now, listen to this now. If you don't find this fascinating, some is wrong. She lost her slob in Savannah and they look for it and look for it and look for it. And her day at Kenny Smith over here went around looking for her slob. Well, a homeless man found her slob. The homeless man returned it to him because everybody in Savannah knew that somebody that Katie was, Carter was looking for her slob. When she got her slob back, they put it online. It went viral. People started to say, well, don't make money to buy another slob. All this money she raised, she decided she was going to donate to homeless. So she wrote a book. The slob goes to Savannah. Is that not incredible? Is that not incredible? And she wrote this little book, guys. I'm telling you, she wrote this little book, The Homeless Man Now, that found the slob. Her parents got in touch with him and got him moved to a facility in Macon, Georgia. And he's now having a facility and getting his rehabilitation. And it's amazing story. Absolutely amazing story. And I mentioned this to Lieutenant Governor and Lieutenant Governor said, wait just a minute, this young lady deserves a proclamation. So the Lieutenant Governor got a proclamation together for you. And he's right here behind us here and he got this for you today. So you want you to have this. I'll give this to your mom today. We'll get a picture with him just a minute. But guys, this is what it's all about. Amen. They heard all about. Thank you so very much. Thanks to mom today. I'd over here. Thank you. And please come to the Chris County thing at five o'clock and you can meet her today. All right. Outstanding. That's outstanding news. Thank you so much, Senator, for sharing that. And congratulations to the parents for doing such a wonderful job with their daughter. What a wonderful little lady and what a wonderful story. So we've so appreciative of having them here. Let's give them another round of applause here. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to talk about one group that is here today. I think they're actually now kind of touring the Capitol and doing some things. But the National Action Network is a civil rights organization in the United States dedicated obviously to conducting civil rights. They also have youth organizations located throughout the United States. And we have one of those organizations in Augusta, Georgia. These youth chapters are dedicated to service and improving the communities. And they're doing a great job within the Augusta area. As I stated, it currently touring, but I did want to give a big welcome to them. But we also do have three of those members who are pages with us today. So I do want to welcome the National Action Network, Sarah, sorry, Branch, Youth Organization. Thank you so much, and I yield the welcome, Mr. President. Thanks, Senator, for bringing out a cent from 36. Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues. I want to reference something that a lot of you already know. And that is that this is senior week at the state capital. Let's hear it for our seniors. And that today, as well, is the time to honor co-age, the Georgia Council on Aging, who convenes seniors from across the state to come down and bring their issues, their concerns, their perspective, their life experience. And we're also very, very proud to today recognize this is the first, and it will be annual, Senior Day for Atlanta seniors. And so we have in our and our, I'll encourage the day, Atlantans, who have come to be a part of Senior Week at the capital and to launch Atlanta seniors coming to the capital. So please stand and recognize these venerable wise folks who have much to share and who this may be their first time at the capital, but it will not be their last. I thank you and appreciate you and please stand and be recognized those of you who've been able to, wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you and don't be a stranger. We will see more of you and of course we'll see you all year round right here in Atlanta. Thank you. I yield the will. Thank you Senator. Senator for recognizing our seniors there and appreciate that. Sixth recognize Senator from the 48th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. In honor of Black History Month, I hope you'll join me and take in a moment to honor an incredible person in our nation's history Condi Liza Rice. Condi was born in Birmingham, Alabama and at age 15 entered the University of Denver where she initially majored in music, considering her career as a concert pianist. However, she found her calling and instead focused her study on international relations. Ultimately earning a master's in economics from Notre Dame and a doctorate of international relations from the University of Denver. In 1986 she started her career in service to this nation and was appointed as a special assistant to the joint chiefs of staff on nuclear energy in her Ronald Reagan. During the administration of President George H. W. Bush, she was the director for Soviet and Eastern European affairs for the National Security Council and was a special assistant to the President. In 2001 she was appointed as National Security Advisor by President Bush and succeeded Colin Powell as Secretary of State in 2005, serving with distinction in the wake of 9-11 in the height of the global war on terror. She worked actively to promote human rights in Iran and organized allied efforts to curtail North Korean nuclear weapons. She was in her time the highest ranking African-American in the executive branch overseeing the administration's foreign and national security policy during a time of great global turmoil and significant threat storeination. One of the most fascinating stories of her time in office was a chance encounter with our current director of the Senate Press Office, a story which he would love to share if you had gladly taken offline to do so. After leaving office in 2009, Rice returned to Stanford where she served as an assistant professor of political science and is provost prior to her career as Secretary of State. And in 2012, Senator from the 24th, in 2012, Condoleezza Rice attained her greatest achievement becoming the first of two women to be admitted as members of the Augusta National Golf Club. She is a proud representative of the Republican Party and I hope you'll all join me in celebrating her today. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to do a history lesson in to talk about property taxes to address the GOP tax scam that will force the middle class seniors and small businesses to pay for yet another giveaway to the wealthy. I also rise to discuss the majority's victory lap on their property tax scam. Let's remind people of a few facts. Number one, Democrats have not controlled this chamber since 2003. Number two, Republicans have controlled both this chamber and the governor's mansion since that time and have held a trifecta since 2005. That's unified Republican control of Georgia for 23 years. Now over those 23 years, Republicans have underfunded our public schools year after year. And upon taking control in 2003, the new majority licked their lips at the possibility of stripping money out of our schools. And underfund them they did to the tune of $1.5 billion by the end of the Purdue administration. It's not just us saying this, let's look at what Georgia Trans Magazine said in 2009. Local school boards have been forced to increase their property taxes to make up for these state cuts. And several boards are taxing at the maximum level and can't go any higher to deal with growing enrollments. And it's not just current Democratic electeds. Our house friend from the 33rd who chairs house regulated industries had this to say about the Purdue administration. The administration refers to these as austerity cuts. But as I have said for the past six years, there's nothing austere about shifting a constitutional responsibility from from one level of government to another. That's a Republican speaking out about Republican policy. And as we know, it's gotten even worse. Between 2010 and 2014, Republicans underfunded our education formula by $1 billion per year. And in 2026 cuts continue rising with no end in sight. The fixed costs of our schools are skyrocketing, even with enrollment declining. In July, school districts costs for employees enrolled in the state health benefit plan will increase 8% per member per month. And for non-certified employees, it's even worse. The state stopped paying the employer share of their health insurance costs in 2012. After causing soaring property taxes for decades, Republicans now blame Democrats for one vote taken last week. I was always taught leadership means the buck stops the people in charge. The majority reminds us that we should blame everyone except the folks who've run the state for 23 years. They think that election year scam will distract us. But that's not how we've ended up with sky high property taxes. In school districts, decimated from 20 plus years of underfunding. So when they tell us we can't trust their numbers, we have decades of evidence showing us we shouldn't trust one thing they say. Don't fall for the scam this time. It's going to raise your grocery bills, bankrupt your small businesses, and raise taxes on seniors. The scheme is simple. A few dollars in the front pocket while they pick your wallet out of the back. Suddenly, you fund another handout to rich people. And don't fall for this property tax scam either. Republican education cuts, drove your property taxes up. It wasn't a vote on a bill that hasn't even gone into law yet. In their solution, under funder schools, defunder police, also that they can get reelected and keep the state treasury open to the rich's Georgians. Let's end the 23 year tax scam this November. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield a well. I can now send it from the second. Thank you, Mr. President. This morning, I rise colleagues today is Savannah State Day. Here at the Capitol, Savannah State is Georgia's oldest public historically black college university founded in 1890, originally known as the Georgia industrial college for Negroes. And we have a privilege today. We have the 15th president of the illustrious university of the Seed, Dr. Jamein Whirl, our 15th president. And I would also be remiss if I did not acknowledge senators, the senator from the second and the senator from the first and the senator from the fourth whom I work with in our local delegation to help become set. And Mr. President, we're very grateful for you for working to help us restore the College of Education. I believe I have some students here in the gallery with me if y'all would wave your hands from the illustrious university by the Seed. And I'd like to recognize one of our alumni, Captain and Christopher Black, with Georgia State Patros and the alumni of Savannah State University. Y'all see him walking around the Capitol. So Savannah State is all throughout Georgia and we appreciate all the sport for everything we do. And we have a motto at the University of By the Seed, our first president, President Wright said, tell them we are rising. And with that I yield the well. Thank you senator from the second. We greatly appreciate our friends from Savannah State being here today and having their new president here. So very glad to have him here today. So we appreciate that. Reagan and Senator from the 38th. Thank you Mr. President. Colleagues, during Black History Month we do more than remember names and dates. We remember the courage it took to change the course of the state and reflect on the responsibility that we carry to move that work forward. It is a profound honor to stand in this chamber as a member of the Georgia State Senate and to represent the people of district 38. Each day I walk into this building I'm reminded that this seat is not just simply holding the seat for this time. It belongs to a lineage of leaders who believe that progress was possible even when the odds said otherwise. And in 1962 Senator Lee Roy Johnson became the first African American elected to the Georgia General Assembly since reconstruction. He was not just a legislator, he was a trailblazer, a strategist, and a steady voice during one of the most defining periods in our nation's history. He advised young leaders like Julian Bond during their Riches Department store sit-ins. He fought for justice both inside the courtroom and alongside communities demanding dignity and equality. From more house college to Atlanta University to North Carolina Central University, he prepared himself not just for a career but for service. And today I sit in that very seat that shaped by that is shaped by courage and dignity and fight. That truth truly humbles me because black history is not just a chapter that has closed. It's living history and a living story that we continue to live today. Written in the choices we make, the policies we pass, and the courage we show when it matters most. That same determination broke barriers in 1962 but it also guides us today. That same faith that opened doors must push us to widen them even further so that every child, every family, and every community in Georgia sees themselves reflected in the opportunities that we all have in this chamber today. I stand here aware that I walk in the footsteps of giants and I honor that legacy not by looking backwards alone but working forward. With integrity, with compassion, and with an unwavering belief that this body can absolutely be a force for good. During this black history month, we may remember that history does not ask us to be perfect. It asks us to be brave. And we may leave this chamber each day committed to building a Georgia that lives up to the promise of those Leroy Johnson's that set in these seats before us. The ones who fought hard to make change real and make the reality for all of us to be able to walk into these doors every day and serve the people of Georgia. And I just want to take a second to share this book. He actually happens to be in here. I walked into my office the other day and this book was sitting on my desk. And the other night we were at a brotherhood smoke and it was shared to us you all need to read this book, Return of the King. And so we're looking it up like what's this book about? And it was shared that this book is actually about Senator Leroy Johnson. And I'm going to share a little bit that's in this book. It shares that Atlanta had been courting and landing professional sports teams in football, basketball, and baseball since the end of 1968. In influential state politician Lee Roy Johnson, Georgia's first black state senator since reconstruction was determined to help Ali return after his exile. The state had no boxing commission to prevent Ali from fighting there. So Johnson made it his mission for Ali to make a comeback in Georgia. Ali's opponent would be Jerry Query, the top heavyweight contender and more important a white man who had spoken out against Ali's objection to the war. So I want to just publicly thank the senator from the 35th for recognizing that I sit and Senator Leroy Johnson seat and for buying me this book. And I just truly hope that we one day will have books that are written about the impact that we have in this great state. And so Mr. President, I yield the well.

We're going to have a senator from 40 seconds. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, two quick things. First, today we have our Council of Pre-Bate Court judges here. I encourage you to assume that we ever get out of here today, but they started lunch downstairs. There will be in 2-16 the Capitol until 1 o'clock, you know, come see your Pre-Bate Court judges. Second, tomorrow is going to be after school day at the Capitol February 12th. This hosted by the Georgia State White After School Network. It's the event that brings together after school and summer learning programs, including the Georgia Alliance, boys and girls clubs, the Georgia Alliance of YMCA's, Los Ninos, Primero, Mercy Housing and the Study Hall. And many more from across the state to recognize their critical role the after school programs play in preparing Georgia's youth for success in college career and life. On your desk, you will see a fact sheet that talks about the boost program. It was funded with $12.5 million in FY26 budget. Something we discussed last year and we talked about childcare affordability as well. Something we discussed with our study committee on that. This program is supporting after school and summer programs that are critical and strengthening Georgia's future workforce and improving education outcomes, supporting working parents and fostering thriving communities. I hope you'll take a few moments tomorrow to join after school and summer learning providers from across Georgia for a breakfast from 9 to 10, 15 in the morning and 216th the Capitol. Thank you, Mr. President. I will yield the will. We're going to send it from the 43rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. I know you've heard that today is Senior Day at this day, Capitol. And I am going to recognize some of the most phenomenal seniors that I know at Easter cabs, Senior Center at Bruce Street, affectionately known as the Thonia Senior Center and the Heart of Lithonia. They are the most loving young people with a variety of senior activities such as sewing, arts and crafts, line dancing, they really can dance, chair aerobics, yoga, group trips, health and wellness. Please welcome them to the State Capitol, Easter cabs, Senior Center and Lithonia at Bruce Street. Are they still up there? They may have left. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the will. I yield the will. I yield the will. Bring it on. I'm sitting from the 8th. The Blueberry farmer himself. All American Blueberry man. Thank you, Mr. President. This has, this personal point of privilege has three things I'm trying to accomplish here. This is the Launce County bird supper tonight at the Depot. I hope everybody will come and enjoy that. And I'll say it is black history, more than so. I wanted to tell a quick story. I've told this story before and it took me nine minutes then, Mr. President. I want to try to do it in about two. But Aussie Davis. Aussie Davis was born Kent's Davis. My wife's great-grandfather wanted to build a railroad. This is before they had been of trucking and they built the Weikras from Western Railroad and he hired a gentleman by the name of Kent's Davis to build that railroad. And this was 1915 and Kent's Davis was a black man. And there were a lot of folks that, there were some folks back then that, you know, times being what they were. Didn't appreciate that. But he and my wife's great-grandfather didn't pay any attention to that and Kent's Davis was the foreman that built that railroad 42 miles long. And two years later, Aussie Davis was born in Caldeal, Georgia, right there at our farm. And so my wife's grandfather, who was born in 1914, they grew up together out there in those woods. And later on, Aussie Davis moved Weikras and he went on to become an award-winning actor on Broadway. He was nominated for Tonys and Grammys and Emmys. He married Ruby D. He was a civil rights leader. He won the Kennedy Awards honors. And his life started right there in those tiny woods in South Georgia. And so that's something that we're proud of and proud of our family's relationship. I have a picture of my wife when she's a little girl. And Aussie Davis is wearing a light blue leisure suit and cares holding a baby doll. And so we're proud of that. And with him being from Weikras, I have my group here from Leadership Weikras. We all stand up, please. And if y'all will, give them a round of applause. So we appreciate y'all being here today. And Mr. President, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to recognize them and talk about Aussie Davis and remind everyone about the birds. So thank y'all, Mr. President, I yield the will. All right, all right, Senator. The bird suffer is always good. It's always good. Glad to have them. We were on the local Lowns County radio station this morning too, right? We had them up here broadcasting live. Good, good folks. Any other Senator Wish speak on a point of personal privilege? You have before you a consent calendar or privilege resolutions, does any Senator Wish remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair here is on the resolutions on the consent calendar are adopted. Are there any motions to withdraw or commit? Secretary Reed, the caption of Senate Bill 400. Senator Burns of the 23rd and others. A bill to be entitled in act 2, men Part 1 A of Article 7 of Chapter 3 of Title 20 of the official Code of Georgia annotated relating to non-public post-secondary educational institutions so as to prohibit unaccredited institutions from offering degrees to require certain institutions to participate in the tuition, guarantee trust fund, and to provide how such institutions may participate, to provide for indemnification, to provide for definitions, to provide for related matters, to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. The Senate Committee on, Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Higher Education recommends that this bill do pass by substitute. Senator Hickman, Chairman. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Higher Education offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 400. A bill to be entitled in act 2, men Part 1 A of Article 7 of Chapter 3 of Title 20 of the official Code of Georgia annotated relating to non-public post-secondary educational institutions so as to prohibit unaccredited institutions from offering degrees and for other purposes. Mr. President, that's a police order. The Senate Committee on Higher Education recommends that this bill be entitled in act 2, men Part 1. Right now, the Senate is from 23rd. To speak to the bill. Senator from 23rd. Senator from 23rd. Senator. Senator. Buehler. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I have before you Senate Bill 400. This is an agency bill from the Georgia non-public post-secondary education commission. Any of you may not be familiar with the commission. It's a state agency that oversees and is responsible for over 358 authorized schools. We have additionally 60 applicants there. There are 81,000 students and a tuition, gross tuition for this system. It's non-public meaning it's private, is over $85 million. You have these schools in your districts and in your hometowns. I checked my Augusta area today in their 26 schools that are covered by the non-public post-secondary education commission. This is a bill that provides several key features for GNPEC. It allows the commission. It strengthens the commission and allows the commission to have oversight and control of bad actors. Occasionally an independent school will come in. They'll set up shot in the storefront. They'll recruit students. They'll accept tuition and then they fail to deliver services. And one of the things that the commission does is protect those students from bad actors. It provides the commission the ability to approve, or deny courses or programs within the school. And without having to go through the administrative process, if they're denied and the school feels it is inappropriate, they can apply and appeal to superior courts. Basically this commission protects students. It protects student records. So in this case, if a school were to abruptly close, the records of the students would be housed in shoe boxes and in closets. The commission needs the ability to capture those records, to provide transcripts, to provide certificates, or program credentials that have been earned so that the students are protected. One thing that we need to be aware of is there is a tuition guarantee trust fund. The tuition guarantee trust fund is the fund that allows the commission to backfill any undelivered service. So if a student comes in, signs up for a program and is not completed, then the commission is able to say they can make that student whole or close to whole, even though the business may have gone bankrupt. So the tuition guarantee trust fund is adjusted to strengthen it. We've allowed for schools who are really good actors to provide a bond or a letter of credit in lieu of service. And then those others would pay in a small percentage, I think it's one tenth of one percent of their tuition annually to have this coverage. So at the end of the day, I'll be happy to answer questions. I'll be happy to walk through the bill in detail, but I appreciate the consideration of the Senate and ask for your favorable consideration. You'll for questions. You'll the well. Thank you, Mr. President. You'll the well. Does any of the senator would speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous question is ordered. Questions on the adoption of the committee? Substitute is the objection to the adoption of the committee. Substitute. Here you know the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the main question is ordered. Question is on the passes of the bill. By substitute, all those in favor of bill vote, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, unliked the machine. The second of the bill, the a's are 48 and a's are one. This bill having to see the rest of the constitution majority is therefore passed by substitute. Senator from the 43rd for the purpose of your eyes. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 26th. That objection is sent from 26 as excused. Moving on to Senate bill 444, Secretary Reed the caption. Senate bill 444 by Senator Kirkpatrick of the 32nd and others. A bill to be entitled and act to amend chapter 46 of Title 33 of the official code of Georgia annotated.

Mr. President, the Senate committee on insurance and labor recommend that this bill do pass by Senator's Harbin, Chairman. Mr. President, that police order. We're going to have a senator from 30th. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill protects patients. We've passed a number of bills on prior authorization of medical treatments over the years. And that's required by insurance companies many times before they'll approve the treatment that your doctor orders. This bill recognizes the important role played by artificial intelligence in this process. Now and in the future, however, the bill specifies that there must be a human clinical peer in the process before an adverse determination is made. I'll be happy to take any questions. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you, I yield. Would any senator wish to speak before we get some measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections to previous question being ordered?
