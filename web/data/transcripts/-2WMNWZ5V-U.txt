TRANSCRIPT
----------
We want to thank everybody for coming out today, especially the person who actually came
and spoke to the Urban Affairs Committee, want to thank our Urban Affairs Chair who did
a remarkable job of putting this together.
Thank everybody, as I said, who actually came out and spoke, very powerful testimony.
I think that's the key, very, very powerful testimony.
One of the things I mentioned just a few minutes ago and I repeated here because I think
it's worth repeating.
And that is that hopefully the people of Georgia was able to see what real legislation is.
As I said, no one was rushed, no one was told they only have one minute or two minutes
or hurry up, we're on a time schedule.
And that happens because you don't care about what happens to Georgia's.
But when you do care about what happens to Georgia's, you find out what it took place
today.
Today was the model, how we actually should be governing.
And that is when you care about Georgia's, when you care about families and you care
about women, you actually sit and listen and you ask good questions and you try to drill
down and find out what actually is going on and how legislation will impact people's
lives.
Because that's what we do.
We impact people's lives.
And HB481 has impacted the lives of the women of this state, has impacted the lives
of families of this state.
As one of our speaker said, women in Georgia live in an air of criminality because of HB
41 and that is beyond unfortunate.
It is a travesty that women in our state
would live in an air criminality
when we talk about their reproductive choices.
And so with that backdrop,
you would think that our attorney general
would want to be here today and say,
no, it's not an air criminality
because this is what the law really sets.
And this is how we're going to interpret this particular law.
But he wasn't here, chose not to show up.
Which is typical, as I said before,
for people who do not care about what Georgians actually think.
And this bill, this law, not only has impact on reproductive choices,
but also has impact on other women's health issues.
We also learned today that maternal health rates in Georgia are terrible,
especially for African-American women,
where they actually many times lead the nation or come close to leading the nation
in death as far as being maternal health.
Those things are not acceptable.
We cannot continue to do business as usual.
And that's what this hearing was about today.
It was a fact-finding mission on some level,
but it also was a mission to let the people of Georgia know
that we care and we hear what you have to say.
And the person who actually put this together
and insisted that we do this,
and she didn't have to insist hard
because we're always there for the people of Georgia,
but that's our cheer, Don Zella James,
and I have her come up and speak.
Thank you.
I'm in slow motion, not on purpose, so one sec.
Thank you very much for coming today, and I'm here to discuss the testimony we've just
hurt upstairs during our urban affairs hearing. We heard about all the ways that this cruel
six-week abortion ban has hurt Georgia women and how too many families have watched loved
ones die for no good reason, all because of this vague and cruel abortion band.
I just mentioned that many people came and gave their testimonies.
Many people watched us on Zoom and they have put comments that I will read later and share
with all of you.
The absence of the number one person who could have truly answered a lot of our questions
and gave clarity to this was invited and that's our Attorney General Chris Carr.
He was invited and he declined and then we asked for someone to come and speak on his
behalf and he declined that as well.
So I asked the Attorney General to just join us for this conversation following the lead
of my colleague, Senator Nabila Islam Part, who has been fighting this issue for more
than a year.
I wanted our AG to answer questions of women across Georgia and what they're asking because
we have one opinion from the person that authored this bill.
Then the governor says something else, and then the AG says something else.
So I wanted him to come and just clarify for us what this does.
And also we invited women who have been adversely affected by this law, this ban, to come.
And they shared with us, I'm still in tears listening to them this morning.
So what are our rights?
What health care may we receive?
Nobody has answered this.
They didn't even answer Senator Partt,
when they just refused to answer us, I guess,
because we had no answer.
I don't know where the Attorney General is today,
but I know that he's listening to this testimony.
He's not hearing about the havoc this abortion man causes.
He's not listening to the stories of women
who have had to suffer under this law.
He's not hearing the stories of mothers who lost daughters
unnecessarily because of this law.
Oh my, some things are important to others.
important to others, that's more important than life itself.
I imagine being one of these women, your baby is at risk unlikely to live.
And now you must wish your own life too.
Doctors won't treat you because they are afraid that they might go to jail.
They don't understand exactly what is going on.
And you can't afford to travel to another state,
or another place to get the care you need.
All you can do is pray that God shows you mercy
and spares your life.
That's what this law does.
It causes women to die unnecessarily, unnecessary deaths.
From treatable causes, wanting to bring a new life
into the world should be the greatest thing that happens.
And it should not mean you may die because
Republican politicians decided it must be so.
Pregnancy should not mean that you cannot access
the medical care that you need to save your life.
So Attorney General Carr isn't here
to explain to us, but I am here.
And I am a woman who, at one time in my life, lost the child.
Oh my, I stayed in the hospital three days.
They can't even get any care now.
This is unacceptable.
So thank you for coming today.
If you have any questions, me and our leader,
our minority leader will answer them at this time.
Again, thank you.
Any questions?
Any questions?
With that, we want to thank you for coming.
Madam, are you any of the last words?
I just want to thank all of the women
who were brave enough to come today
and give us their testimonies.
And the experts who came and talked to us,
the people in DC who were on the Zoom line with us
who also shared the national organization of women
who shared the other experts as well.
And House Pember Parks and others.
Thank you all so to our committee, yes, go ahead.
If it's not changed, it'll be more of the same.
We hope that we can come together
and really serve the people's needs
and not the politics.
So we hope that somehow we can change this.
But if we don't, I see no changes.
It might even get a whole lot worse,
and that's what we're trying to stop today.
I would concur with that and say that,
obviously, women are now living in an air criminality
or fear, imagine the fear that have now,
knowing that this was put together.
Knowing we asked our attorney general to come here today
actually answer these particular questions. Not in a combative way. This is a
fact-finding day quite frankly, but now that they know that, he did not think
enough to come in and actually come and tell us about this particular law, I
would think that that fear is only going to increase quite frankly.
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.
