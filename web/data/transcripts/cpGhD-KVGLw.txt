----------
All members will please report to their seats on the floor of the chamber in the gallery
and in room 341.
All members will please report to the House of Representatives.
the clerk will ring the bell.
All members will please take their seats.
We are about to have the morning roll call.
We're about to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted, have all members voted, if so the clerk will lock the
machines. Well good morning. Welcome back. You may notice that we have a number of
excused members on the board and they are out for various reasons. They are not
all out and I want to repeat that. They are not all out because they've tested
positive for COVID. So I don't want their rumors to not that there would ever
develop a rumor in this building. But I don't want a rumor out there that
there's been an outbreak in the house because there certainly has not been and
many of these members will be present tomorrow. I want to remind all the
members too before we begin of the testing policy that has been repeated
distributed amongst the membership of the house, the dates and the requirement that you
be tested by Georgia Tech and the protocol for the testing.
You know, that's not there to make you happy or make you feel good, but it's there to
take care of your members, your colleagues.
So we've had some concerns about why people have to test in that fashion.
Well, I'm not trying to make anybody happy about the testing except I'm trying to keep
everybody well and I'm going to keep doing that.
So, doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
Before we begin today, I know there's a lot of prayer needs and a lot of people back home
around us that are suffering from COVID, but I want to point out that we have had two
members that have been informed about this morning that they have lost their parents
And Representative Roba Show and Representative Dunahoo and let's keep them close in our prayers.
That's a pain like no other.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 178th House District
Representative Stephen Meeks, Representative Meeks.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
What a beautiful day it has turned out to be after a very stormy morning, Hatton.
Today it is my honor to introduce someone who is no stranger to this house, as he has
served as chaplain of the day in previous sessions.
And colleagues are in for a treat because the messages that he brings are always
biblically true, always timely, and always needed. A dynamic speaker, he's a leader, a servant,
and a true man of God. Brother Mike Stone is a native of Valdosta, Georgia, and a graduate
of Valdosta State College, as he said this morning before, it was Valdosta State University.
He was first called as Minister of Music at a Manual Baptist Church 25 years ago.
He has served as Senior Pastor for 19 of those 25 years.
For many years he has served as the chaplain for the Pierce County Bear Football Team, which
are also the 2023 state football champions. He has served the Georgia Bible's convention
as preaching conference president, as chairman of the executive committee, and convention
president. He has also served at the national level on the resolutions committee, and the
immediate past chairman of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.
Most recently, ladies and gentlemen, he has announced his
cannot see for President of the Southern Baptist Convention,
which would take place, the lecture would take place later
this year in Tennessee.
He has daddy to four wonderful children and husband
to Andrea.
I'm privileged to sit under his teachings every week.
He's a man of God who unapologetically teaches the word of God.
Please help me in welcoming my pastor, Mike Stone.
What is indeed a privilege to be here, I have great respect for this house and those who
serve the great people of the state of Georgia in your ministry here.
The Bible declares in the book of Romans that those who serve in seats of government are
ministers of God for the good of those who are under their authority.
So though our ministries are different and varied, we are all ministers of the Lord,
and it is a privilege to be in this place today.
I was reminded on several occasions of the tightness of your schedule and those frequent
reminders reminded me of the story of the young seminary student preparing for the ministry
and he went out as a student to preach one Sunday as a guest preacher.
He asked his preaching professor, do you have a word of advice?
The professor said, I don't have a word, I have five words of advice and they are these.
Be brief, brother.
Be brief.
I do want to be mindful of your busy schedule,
but I've titled my brief comments today,
my prayer for you.
And the text for the day is drawn
from Paul's first letter to Timothy,
chapter two, beginning in the first verse.
The word of God says,
first of all, then I urge that in treaties
and prayers, petitions and thanksgiving
be made on behalf of all men for kings
and all who are in authority,
so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life
and all godliness and dignity.
this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all men to be saved
and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
It was reported that when Reverend Edward Everett Hale was serving as chaplain of the
U.S. Senate, someone asked him if he looked at the nation and prayed for the senators and
he quipped, no, I look at the senators and I pray for the nation.
The reality is regardless of what position or party or principles you may have, your position
as members of this great assembly warrant the prayers of the people of God.
There are not many things that I can say I know for a fact or the will of God for your
life, but the Bible says it is the will of God that we pray for those who are in authority
above us.
And the prophet Samuel declared in 1 Samuel 12-23, God forbid that I should sin against
God by ceasing to pray for you and so my devotional word this morning again
simply entitled my prayer for you. And I just want to mention three simple things
that will be the centerpiece of the prayers that I will pray as God lays the
members of this body on my heart today and in the days ahead. First of all I
pray for your protection. I pray for your protection. I've attended this
This assembly on many occasions, as a guest in the gallery, on several of the past occasions,
is Chaplain of the Day, but this is the first time that I recall seeing the type of armed
protection out in the streets, and of course we come through the metal detectors and this
building and all who enter here are protected by law enforcement and we thank God for that.
From the violet riots that swept the country last summer to the tragic events and deaths
that occurred earlier this month in the nation's capital, we've been reminded in vibrant living
color that our country can be a violent and dangerous place.
And so we should thank God that in our country we don't change our leaders with bullets,
but we are blessed to be able to change them with ballots.
Whether it's the Georgia State Patrol, the National Guard, the local police, the Sheriff's
Department, or the many brave men and women who protect this building and all who enter
it.
from God. And I thank the Lord for them today as I pray for your protection. This
was really on the heart of one of our forefathers who wrote in a tremendous
hymn, our Father's God to thee, author of liberty to thee we sing. Long may our
land be bright with freedom's holy light, protect us by thy might, great God,
our King. And I'm aware some 127 declares that unless the Lord guards the
city, the watchman stays awake in vain. And my prayer for your protection is that the only
barbs that would fly in these hallowed halls would be those verbal flaws that are the
product of healthy debate. I heard about two senators who came from farming districts
and they were arguing over an appropriations bill. One of them was a staunch liberal from
an economic perspective and the other was a staunch conservative and the conservative
farming legislator said to his liberal colleague, he said, I don't understand your economic
policy, you want to give my hard earnings to someone who hasn't worked for it.
And the liberal legislator said, well, that's just what I believe.
And the conservative said, you mean if you had two farms that you had worked for and I had
not worked to earn one, you'd give me one of your two farms, he said, I sure would.
He said, you mean if you had two silos that you had worked hard to earn and I did not,
You would give me one of those, and the liberal legislator said, I sure would.
He said, well, I don't understand.
You mean if you had two giant combines that you had worked hard to earn, and I didn't have
one because I didn't work, you'd give me one of those two combines.
He said, I sure would.
He said, let me get this straight.
You mean if you had two cows that you had worked for to pay, and I didn't have one, you'd
give me one of those two cows, and the liberal said, well, that's not fair.
You know I have two cows.
I pray that attempt that humor does not offend you, but I say it to simply say this.
If that does offend you, I pray that that is the worst thing that ever happens to you.
As you serve the citizens of the state of Georgia, I pray for your protection.
Quickly now, secondly, I pray for your wisdom.
The Bible says in the book of James, if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask God and God
will grant it with liberality.
Some decisions are easy in the home, in the community, in the workplace, and in this assembly.
Some are as plain as can be.
You've already made up your mind.
You have these convictions.
You have your preferences and your stands.
But sometimes there are decisions we have to make for which there is no clear cut answer.
That does not mean that there isn't a right answer or a wrong answer.
It just means the right answer is not always an obvious answer.
In my ministry, I've been blessed as Representative Meek said, I have served as the chairman of
the board for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, which has millions and millions of dollars
in assets, an early 40 million dollar budget this year, the recent, the immediate past chairman
of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, which has billions of dollars
in assets and have served as presidents and chairman of these respective boards.
I pastor a church in South Georgia that has a multi-million dollar annual budget, but
I do not mind telling you that in the last ten months, I have questioned my own ability
to lead more than at any other time in my life and my ministry, because of this thing that
separates and distances us even in this building and causes us to wear masks, COVID-19 has
created a lot of different challenges.
Not prayer for you as it whether you face challenging decisions as a legislator, as a parent,
or even as a child, caring for aging parents that you would understand the truth of Proverbs
3, 5, and 6.
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding, but in all your
ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path.
My prayer for you is a prayer for protection, a prayer for your wisdom, finally a prayer
for your integrity.
The word integrity is based on the same root word as the word integrated and it means there
is consistency that when we look or peer into any aspect of your life, we see the same man,
we see the same woman.
My prayer for you is that you would reject all counsel that violate spiritual principles
and that you would resist the inevitable pressures of this place to lose your integrity.
I pray that you would be the same person here as you are at home, the same person in
the hallway as you are on the floor, the same person in plenary session as you are in
committee, the same person in committee as you were at supper the night before, the same
person in Atlanta as you are back home.
I pray that there would be no secret life hidden agenda or private side of you that only
a handful of people really know about.
For the Bible says in Proverbs 20 verse 7 that the righteous man walks in his integrity
and his children are blessed after him.
Some years ago, preparing to preach my first funeral
of veteran pastor gave me a little illustration.
He said, challenge the people at that funeral
to live the kind of life,
so that they can enjoy it while they're living it.
And then when they get old,
they can sit on their front porch
and look back on it and enjoy it a second time.
25 years in the ministry now,
I've added a third line to that great word of advice.
Live your life in such a way
so that you can enjoy it while you're living it.
When you get old in retirement, you can look back on it and enjoy it a second time.
And then when your children lay you in the arms of God, your sons and daughters and grandchildren
can look back on your life and enjoy it even a third time.
That is my prayer for you that our great God would protect you, give you wisdom and help
you walk in integrity.
May we pray together?
Our Father in our God, we come to you the only way we can, the only way we know how, through
the blood and by the name of your Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus.
And I do pray without apology that you would protect the members of this house and all
those who would serve in positions of leadership.
I pray that you would grant them wisdom not based on their knowledge or experience, but
based on a wisdom that can only come from you.
And I do pray that they would walk in holiness, righteousness, blamelessness, and integrity
for the good of the citizens of their district, for the good of the residents of this wonderful
state, and for the ultimate honor and glory of Jesus Christ and whose name we make our
prayer.
Amen.
A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

If I could have your attention please, if I could have your attention please.
We have a member of this body who has deliberately failed at all to be tested since we began
session, clearly in violation of our testing policy, jeopardizing the health of other members
in this chamber.
So I'm going to ask that member, I'm going to try to be as discreet as possible to quietly
leave the chamber unless you prefer it otherwise.
So I have not heard the will of this house that we abandon our testing policy.
Is it your desire that we not be tested?
Then I'm going to ask a member of the public safety unit back there under rule four of
the House to escort the member from the chamber. He'll be eligible to return once he's complied
with our testing policy.
Any public safety officer, uh, member of the Georgia State Patrol is authorized under
room four of the house to escort the member from the chamber.
House will come back to order. House will come back to order. This house will be at
order. You know this job sometimes is not all it's correct up to be but I don't
know about y'all but I've been to too many funerals and I'm getting tired of
going to them. I don't know when this will end. We all pray that it'll be sooner rather
than later but until that time I think it behooves us to do whatever we need to do to be safe
and to show love toward our neighbors rather than go out there and get media attention
for standing up to authority and I'm going to stop right there. Reports of
standing committee is the clerk will read. Representative Chan Takersley the
160th District Chairman of the Committee on Intergovernment Coordination
Local submitted the following report. Mr. Speaker your committee on Intergovernment
Coordination Local has that under consideration the following bill of the
House is instructed me to report the same back-to-the-house following
recommendations, House Bill 61, due pass, respectfully submitted,
representative, chakersley, 160th district, Charmin.
That completes the reading of the Reports of Standing Committees.
Third reading and passage of uncontested local bills.
If there is no objection, well, we only have one, so we'll vote on it as a whole with a recorded vote.
The clerk will read the local calendar.
House Bill 61, my resident, Carpenter IV, Whitfield County, House Bill 61,

the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed for what purpose does representative
carpenter rise make a motion state your motion. I move that the House immediately transmit
this to the Senate.

All right, we're going on now to morning orders.
This house will come to order a lot of movement going on around here today.
Going on now to morning orders, we'll do a little different today.
not going to divide it up per member.
We're going to see who will respect the time of their
colleagues, but we'll turn it off after 20 minutes
because that's pursuant to the rule.
The chair recognizes Speaker Ralston for a morning order.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
A few years ago I had one of those moments that kind of last for a lifetime and I've cherished
it since then, and it remained stamped in my memory.
Sitting in what was then Son Truss Park, I had an opportunity to sit and have a long,
unhurried visit with a true hero, a giant with whom I had grown up, but I had never met.
Aaron. I told him that night that I could not remember a time in my life that he was
not a part of my world, although we had never met. You know, growing up a baseball fan
back in the 60s, we didn't have 20 games a night to choose from on TV. You got one on
Saturday afternoon with Dizzy Dean and P.W. Reese doing the play by play and I can
remember how excited I would be on those Saturday afternoons when they had the
Milwaukee Braves on and I still remember the celebration in this city across
Georgia and indeed the entire southeast when it was announced that the
The braves were moving to Atlanta.
Big League Baseball was coming to the South because at that time, if you wanted to clean
closest to home, you had to pull for the St. Louis Cardinals or the Washington Senators.
We all became Hank Aaron fans from Little League Fields to Cal Pastures all over.
Some boys tried to imitate that looping, fluid swing, and the smooth, seemingly effortless
catch of a fly ball in the outfield.
For most of us, we didn't see a black man.
We saw a ball player, a baseball grade who was quietly becoming a legend, and he was
a legend who played for the Atlanta Braves, not the New York Yankees, not the Los Angeles
Dodgers, and not the Chicago Cubs, but Hank Aaron was ours.
Most of us were oblivious to the struggles of Hank Aaron on the road to becoming a super
star until later.
We were not aware of the hate mail, the cat calls, and the various other forms of hostility
which were heaped upon this man.
But we saw a man of quiet dignity and a goodness that caused him to suffer in silence.
Hank Aaron will be defined by April 8, 1974 when he made baseball and sports history in
an iconic moment.
But he will also be defined as a sports star who quietly gave back to his community and
who demonstrated that grace and dignity mattered.
And a man who just two weeks before his death was doing something as simple and heroic as
advocating for people to take the COVID vaccination.
He was a legend.
And he was ours.
But through it all, he was a ball player.
I know that Chairman Smiley wants to be heard, and I think that Chair is going to recognize
him next, and we'll have a little treat after his remarks.
But I think it would be appropriate, Madam Speaker, for us to reflect and with a moment of silence
on this life.
Thank you. I yield the well.
Chair recognizes the Dean of the House,
Representative Smarring, for a morning order.
Good morning, now.
The speaker and members of the House.
Before I make my remarks, I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your leadership this morning
and ensuring the safety of all the members of this house.
You know, Speaker alluded to this, but Hank Aaron died from natural causes, and I was
with him when we took the COVID-19 vaccination together. And I want to thank him for that.
And on our tombstones, there will be two dates, the day that you're born and the day that
you pass away. It's not your birthday, which we celebrate, nor your passing date, which
we mourn that matters on your tombstone. What matters on your tombstone is what did you do with the
dash? What would your dash say? Hank Aaron dash will say yes he was a Hall of Famer,
yes he received the Stam usual lifetime award, yes he was a successful business person,
but I think the person that I know his dash will say that he was a given person.
that he was a compassionate person that he did not waver in his love for his family
in his community, in his state, and his nation. So I joined Speaker Austin and other members
that have signed the resolution on commending him for his life and San DeBilla Aaron.
I talked to a family representative last night and she says thank you Mr. Speaker for this
recognition this morning when I text the speaker over the weekend and told him how I felt
about this and he knew that we all loved Hank Aaron and I met Aaron about 30 years ago
but I said in Fortin County Stadium on April I was a young man running for public office
in 1974, and I saw him hit 715 on April the 8th, 1974, in the upper, upper, upper, upper,
upper, upper, upper, way up there, out, in the upper, up, needed binoculars to see him
run around the bases, but to, to Bill Aeron and to the Aeron family, I want you to know
know that this house stands with you during this difficult time.
And I pray that God hold you close to his heart where he can feel and know your deepest
lost and then feel you with his deepest love.
So Mr. Speaker, thank you for this resolution and on behalf of the Aaron family.
We thank all of you all.
Hank Aaron was a favorite son.
He was someone we saw as a sports person, but I see him as a walk-in living legend, an
icon in our state and in our nation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield well.
Through it all, Henry Aaron persevered.
His pursuit of baseball's most cherished record continued, and on opening day of 1974, he took
his place alongside Babe Ruth.
Three one-fifth, air to drive into one field.
That ball is going, going, and out of here.
Henry Aaron has just tied.
They broke in the all-time home run parade.
The record they said that couldn't be reached
has just been reached by Henry Aaron.
Four days later, Aaron and the Braves
headed home to Atlanta.
Get up for me, man.
Get up my way.
On April 8th, 1974, the Braves hosted the Dodgers in the first home game of the season,
with Aaron one swing away from surpassing the Sultan of Swat.
Someone told me later once it was cold, I didn't feel a thing.
They said it was drizzling, I didn't feel a thing.
Hank told me, you know, that what he's gonna do.
He said, I'm tired of this, I'm gonna get this over with right now.
Here's the pitch by Downey Swinging.
Here's the drive into left center field.
That ball is gonna be out of here.
Next time, next time, next time, next time, next time.
There's a little home-right champion of all time
at a Henry Aaron.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I thought about you coming along, ways, baby.
You know what I mean?
It's from Mobile, Alabama, all the way
to breaking one of the most prestigious record
in baseball.
I feel very proud of myself.
I don't know how my mother ever got out of the stand,
But I guess she was bent on being out there,
which was fine with me.
But she gave me the biggest, tightest hug I ever had in my life.
I don't know how I got loose.
He had tears on his cheek and tears in his eyes.
And I remember being stunned, I said, Henry Aaron is crying.
What a marvelous moment for baseball.
What a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia.
What a marvelous moment for the country in the world.
A black man is getting a standing ovation in the deep south
for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol.
Not just thank God, it's all over with.
Thank you very much.
At the time he called it quits, Aaron was second all-time
in runs and hits, and had more home runs,
RBI's, and total bases than anyone
who ever played the game,
tribute to the remarkable quality and consistency of his career.
The way to fame is like the way to heaven through much tribulations.
It had been for me to quote a very popular song along in Wyndon Road.
He was a pillar of strength and if anybody black, white, red, or technical or has a problem
you can look at Henry Aaron.
It's a look at the strength he had.
I think that people can look at me and say, you know, he was a great baseball player, but
he was even a greater human being.
We've got a few minutes left for morning orders and the chair recognizes Representative
Carpenter for a morning order.
you speaker. I come before you today guys to show you the the rug for this
session. They're not in yet but they will be here in about a month and you'll
come by my office in 408 and we'll give it to you but it's a great rug. It shows
the carpet industry and it's support for Georgia grown and agriculture. So I'm
gonna hold it up so everybody can see.
So of course I'll be dropping this one off in the speaker's office. I yield to
well. Always glad to get him. Chair recognizes the whip of the majority caucus,
whip Kelly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I want to thank you
for your words this morning about the seriousness of the pandemic we're dealing
with, and the tragedy that our country is going through, our states going through, and
each of our communities is going through.
You talk about us having to attend too many funerals, I agree, and last week, unfortunately,
our community, the Rotmart community, the Polk County community, had to have a funeral
for one of our most beloved members, our city manager, Jeff Ellis of Rotmart, passed
on January the 15th, 2021.
Jeff was a public servant in every sense of the word.
He served as the chief of the Rotemart Fire Department
for 15 years, and then he served as city manager
for 25 more.
40 years of public service to the Rotemart community.
He left his fingerprints all over the city of Rotemart
in Polk County, from the recreation department
to our 911 system to redoing City Hall.
Left behind from Jeff was his loving wife of 45 years,
Mr. Ginger, son, mate, his daughter, Jennifer,
five grand sons, and three great grandkids.
I ask you, please join me in a moment of silence
for this great public servant.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield the well.
I understand he passed from COVID.
Chair recognizes representative Dunnohoor for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker.
It could be a little tough, but this morning at 2 a.m., my father, Emory West, and a
whose senior went to me with our heavily father.
But one of the things, he was an avid hunter, an avid fisherman that passed that loved me.
He retired with Southern Bell after 35 years, and we spent a lot of time hunting and fishing
together. But one dream I remember as a young man, he said,
Bubba, we're going to move the Gainesville, Georgia,
Lake Lanier. And I'm going to catch the Lake record large
mouth bass. Now, he predicted that. Not only did he predict
that, he did that. 55 years now, Lake Lanier's record, he
has held at 17 pounds and 9 ounces. And I'll never forget
that because the love that I have for my Father will continue. But I want to say a quick
prayer and thank you everyone for reaching out.
Heavenly Father, we lift you up and we praise your name. We thank you for each person
here. We pray that you be with each family that you put your arms around him. You know
the needs and the hurts, but Lord do we know you have us all in your arms. We pray for
my mom this morning in my family. As I go to them later, that heavenly Father, we know
my Father is with you. We lift up all these people in Jesus' precious name. Amen. Thank
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Representative Buttner for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
I too come with a little bit of sad news.
The State of Georgia, Taubert County, Georgia, and Junction City in particular, lost the
longest serving county commissioner in the state.
He passed away January 15th of COVID, and he had served Taubert County as commissioner
for 50 years.
December 31st he ended his term after serving 50 years, 35 of the 50 years he was chairman
of the county commission. I thought it was kind of interesting to learn some things
about him as we visited and when he first started in the county commissioner, one of the
things he wanted to do was improve the pay and benefits of the county employees. And
The other thing he wanted to do was make sure that we had a way for people that were hurt
or injured to get to a hospital rather than calling the funeral home and writing in
the Hearst.
He wanted an ambulance.
So he set up our ambulance system.
He set up seven, he and the rest of the county commission and a lot of grant need help
along the way.
We now have seven volunteer fire departments, an EMT system and we also were the first
of many counties to look at how we could coordinate services and we are the first region to have
eight counties come together for a 911 call center. But when you talk to him the thing he was most
proud of is that his boys went to 4-H camp and they came home and they said daddy,
Tabet County's got a horrible reputation.
We are the county with the most non-flushable toilets
in the state.
And so Freeman Montgomery went and did some research,
and he got a ticket in Blue to Washington,
and he came home with a block grant in the 1970s,
of $900,000.
And they went and they put in running hot water heaters, sinks,
bathtubs, toilets, and septic tanks to over 100 homes.
And Freeman would tell this story off of them.
He would say that a man in his 90s came up to him
in a public meeting one day and he said,
you know, Mr. Montgomery, I gotta thank you.
You got me out of the bushes.
He said that was his most proud moment, and he would tell anybody that ran for office
he said, if any of us run for elected office and we serve for just a day, there are going
to be those who love us and those who hate us.
But he said always remember to make yourself available.
To vote time to the job, be honest whether they like it or not, be dependable and be
accessible and if all of that doesn't work when people call you call them back.
So if you would remember his family, his grandchildren and his wife and it is a sad time
she has COVID now and they are quite fearful for her as well and Talbot County lost someone
who has served them well.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes the Governor's floor leader, Representative Burt Reeves.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today I rise to provide some context and some clarity and some talking points about the
news stories that are being passed around amongst some of our colleagues and our friends
out in the hallway.
The top story in today's Atlanta Journal Constitution reads, quote, no boost in budget
for pandemic." It makes it sound as if Georgia has ignored the pandemic. In fact, you have
to read all the way to the 11th paragraph on page 8A before the story notes that more
than $1 billion has been spent by the state government alone in Georgia to respond to
the pandemic. And that is more than four times of our annual public health spending.
It does not take Georgia Tech calculus to add that up, members.
How can that be?
How can it say that there's been no boost in the budget when we have quadrupled spending?
As recently as last week, Governor Kimp and a press conference said very clearly that
we will use every resource.
Our time, our people and our funding in our response efforts last week when members
of this General Assembly asked our respected public health leader, Dr. Tumi, why she didn't
request more state funding. She clearly answered that our federal partners have continued
to provide the assistance that we need, and there's likely to be even more provided under
the new administration. In fact, the new administration has already proposed it. They've proposed
$1.9 trillion. So I urge my colleagues and my friends in the room today, as we work together
to pass budgets that address the priorities that we all have for our state.
Let's get past the sensational headlines that very well may sell papers,
but do not help Georgians understand the full extent that we have gone through
to protect both lives and livelihoods in this state. Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Wolenski for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker.
As our new U.S. Senators are sworn in, they carried history with them, a history not known
to many.
For me, seeing a Jewish man and a black man in Georgia running side-by-side, running
together for unity and health, jobs, just as for the people who made me extremely hopeful.
While many have learned of the historic significance of the election of the first Jewish and first
Black Senators from Georgia, many didn't know the deep history of the Jewish community
and Black community working together in Georgia throughout the civil rights movement.
There is a deep history of the Jewish community and Black community helping each other fight
for true justice, because we all know that in justice anywhere, hatred anywhere is injustice
to everyone.
To me, the vision of Senator Assof and Senator Warnoff working together was a 21st century
version of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, a Rep. U.G. from
Hitler's Europe. Dr. King and Rabbi Helstrom can be seen in photos crossing the Edmund
Pettis Bridge, Armin, Armin, Armin, March 1965, and standing together outside Arlington
Cemetery in Silent Protests in 1968. I hope this vision of a Jewish man and a black man
standing up together in the fight for equal justice for all inspires us all to come together
and show the people of Georgia that progress is possible. Their victories prove that the
historic bond between Georgia's Jewish and black communities is alive and well is re-invigorated
by this historic moment.
Another link to Georgia history at Lana History is that Senator Assof was sworn in holding
Hebrew scripture that belonged to Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, past Rabbi of the Temple, a civil
arts activist, and a close ally in front of Dr. King.
Also with Senator Assof, in his pocket were copy of the ship's manifest recorded Ellis
Island when his great-grandfather arrived in 1911 and his great-grandmother arrived in
1913.
A century later, their great grandson was elected to the US Senate, a true American Dream
story.
Today I stand to honor the first U.S. Senator in Georgia,
John Assoff.
Let's give a round of applause, I hope,
for this historic moment at the very least for me
and all the Jewish people in Georgia.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
We are way out of time on morning orders.
Those that didn't get reached today will be put
on tomorrow's.
Clark will read the caption to a group

Chair recognizes the majority leader for a motion.
speaker I would move speak to a resolution speak to a resolution yes or
that's better but if you insist that I was going to speak to the motion as
well I just wanted to get it done let's speak I would ask the clerk if we
had read the caption a resolution relative to meetings and adjournments of the
general assembly chair recognizes the majority leader to explain the
resolution. Mr. Clerk, if you will put a schedule up, our proposed schedule. I
think my colleagues, all of you know that under this speaker's leadership, his
number one priority is the safety. Number one priority is the safety of the
members of this body. But very closely behind that priority is tending to the
people's work of this state and make sure we're here. We're doing our work and
we're doing it safely and doing it efficiently. With that in mind, there's been
been very close work. There's been schedules been working out with the Senate
and Leader Dugan and all the leadership on the other side of the hall. They've
been very welcoming and have the same priorities that we do to make sure this
entire General Assembly operates efficiently, effectively, but with those
priorities. So with that, all of you see that we will be in tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday of
this week. Then we will be out, of course, on the weekend, back in on Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday of the following week. And then back on Monday, February the 8th, for day,
literally day 13. And certainly all of this schedule is opinion on the continued safety of the
members of this body as we work to make sure we complete the people's work here in the house.
There are any questions, Mr. Speaker. I will answer those. We have some very important work that
we'll be attending to this week. It will come before us, and certainly the Senate will be close
behind us as they work on what we send over to them, but we appreciate them working with us
as we put this schedule together that moves us on down the road towards completing our work here
in completing our 40 days.
With that, Ms. Speaker, if there's any questions,
I'll answer them, if not, I'll yield the well.
You did not have any questions.
