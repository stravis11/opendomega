you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I trust that everyone enjoyed the ball game last night. The ball was a good game. As is the custom, the Senate is dragging in this afternoon sometimes. We hope they are getting their business tinnitus. We are going to move on to get our business tinnitus today. We are going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will unlock the machines. Doors are closed and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 56th House District Representative Misha Maynard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am very excited to introduce the chaplain of the day. His name is Elder Galt from the 70th House. He is the regional galt of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He oversees the Southern States and I initially met him at a community event in my district, which I hope we can one day bring to the state capital. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they do a lot of community efforts, not only here in the U.S., but also across the globe.

And when I met him over the winter break, they have something called a giving machine. The giving machine, it reminds you of a vending machine. The difference though is you may buy a goat that feeds a community for a year, for $100 instead of a snicker bar. You might buy a child in an orphanage, a bicycle. And it's a fabulous resource, not only for us, but for those abroad. He is the father of five children, and they are all girls, and he also is the grandfather to 19 grandchildren. His representative is representative David Clark, and he really is a chaplain, not just for me, but he's a chaplain for everyone in this district, in this chamber, because he oversees 168 churches and 100 meeting houses, and without further ado, please welcome Elder Galt. Good morning. I thank you as individuals for your public service. I know it's a sacrifice to your family, to your career, and to your personal life for you to be here, and represent the people of the state of Georgia. An ancient prophet taught us, and behold, I tell you these things that you may learn wisdom, that you may learn that when you are in the service of your fellow beings, that you are only in the service of your God. I recognize you today as servant to the people, but also in service to God. And I thank you for that. We're all children of God. That makes us true brothers and sisters, no matter our background, where we come from, our race, our religion, our lifestyles, or our beliefs. In the scriptures at the time of Christ, the Sadducees and Pharisees conspired to trick Jesus into saying something controversial, so they could use it against him, then one of them, which was a lawyer, and my apologies to the lawyers, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, master, which is the great commandment in the law? And they were quite sure that anyway, Jesus answered that they could challenge him and say, yeah, but what about this, or what about that? Is that not important? Jesus confounded them by saying something that hadn't been said before. Now shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, but Jesus didn't stop there. He also gave them the second great command, which they hadn't even asked for. Now shall love thy neighbor as thyself, and who is our neighbor? It's not measured in proximity to where he lived, but it means everyone. I think the reason he gave them the second one is that they're really inseparable. You can't love God and not love your neighbor. In today's world, some approach that their solution to a problem must entirely prevail over all others. It's hard to accomplish anything that way. We can compromise and hold true to core values. The best solutions come when we truly counsel together, truly listen to those with other views, and try to put ourselves in the shoes of those we disagree with. This is what God would have us do. We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man, and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them for the good and safety of society. We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held ill-violet as we'll secure to each individual the free exercise of conscious, the right and control of property, and the protection of life. We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce laws of the same, and that such as we'll administer the lie and equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people. In the early days of our church, the leader of our church wrote our articles of faith, and these principles are also taught in our day. I share a couple of them with you, and since it was written in the mid-1800s, sometimes the language may seem a little bit old, but the principles are very clear. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. We believe in being honest, true, chased, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. Indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul. We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or a good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. God answers prayers. He will answer your prayers as you strive to do what's right in these sessions, and invite you to pray often and to listen to his inspiration and act upon it. The prophets have taught us, behold that which is of God, invited and entice us to do good continually, wherefore everything which invited and entice us to do good and to love God and to serve him is inspired of God. May you receive his inspiration. I testify that Jesus Christ atone for our sins and sufferings and the sins and sufferings of all. And I say that in the name of Jesus Christ and now offer a prayer. Our Father in Heaven, we come here today before thee with gratitude in our hearts for the many blessings that that was given us. We're grateful for the freedoms we have in this country, for the opportunity to be able to select good people to represent us and to create laws. We're so grateful for these individuals, particularly in this chamber today, for the sacrifices that they give up in their own lives, to serve us as the people of Georgia and also to serve thee. I ask thee to bless them with inspiration, bless them with clarity, bless them with goodness and kindness and that this goodness and kindness will come to the top of everything that they do. I bless them to be good. I ask thee to bless them to be good listeners, to listen to all points of view to come up with the best solutions possible. Father in Heaven, I ask thee to bless their families. Well, they're away from their families for this period of time and I ask thee to bless their spouses and their children and their other loved ones that they may be uplifted in every way and that they may be happy. I ask thee to bless those who serve as administrative and staff people here for the legislature that they too may feel of ice spirit and be blessed. I ask thee Father in Heaven to please help all of these legislators recognize that God knows who they are and that He loves them. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Contributes to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Take a picture. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members, you may greet the chaplain in the south any room, Elder Galt, we appreciate that message and we appreciate your blessings on us. Thank you on the members and our staff. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I'd like to urge each of you to consider expanded Medicaid because they're a hospital in South Georgia and a few hospital recently in Atlanta, which had the clothes because lack of fun. I think no one knows that better than you, how much finances represent the milk that helped the on the grid, the good work that we try to do to help take care of the citizen of Georgia. I'm proud of what you all are doing. I want to see us step up to the next level and do even more. I've been happy to represent the Georgia State Medical Association as chairman of the board. The present time, I was president of the Atlanta Medical Association. I had a good pleasure of coming to the governor's office meeting years ago when I served on the Georgia Diabetes Advisory Board. Again, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell you how important it is for us to try to help take care of the underserved, all the citizens of Georgia. Briefly, from an epidemiological point of view, minorities are disproportionately affected by diabetic eye disease. But those who do not have access to care are also affected as well. So again, let's just continue to do what you're doing and advance the level of care in the state of Georgia. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Wilkes. We can hear by your introduction. You're a very busy man. So we appreciate you taking time to be here to serve us today. Representative Chocos, if you make your way down to the front, you're going to be my first morning order. Representative Chocos. Thank you, Baker. I've got a great group of students and faculty and teachers and the superintendent from Webster County. All right, guys, in the balcony. I'll stand up. Superintendent Dorothy Ingram brought the students here. 17 seniors from the senior government class. Catholic Scott Ashley Grimes and James McCullough brought them here. And I wanted them to see their capital and experience and see what we do here at the state capital. I know it's a little bit of chaos. But thank you for making the trip. I'll see y'all shortly. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Chairman, Chairman. Appreciate it. Chairman Hawkins is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This week, February 13th, the 17th is the co-aged senior week. Co-aged was began in 1977. It was established as the council on aging to serve as advisers to our state's leadership on issues which affect seniors of this state. Over 1.5 million Georgians are 65 and older, which is 15% of our population. Co-aged provides available resources and recognizes the needs of all our seniors. In the balcony today, we have the executive director of Co-aged, Mr. Deborah Stokes, and some of the other members. If you would recognize them, I'd appreciate that. Thank you all for your service. Thank you. Thanks, Chairman Hawkins. Representative Joe Campbell is recognized for a morning order and he wants someone to come with who you want. There are Representative Campbell. Representative Stephen Meeks. Representative Stephen Meeks. He had to step out for a minute. Looks like you're on your own. Oh, there he is. Representative Chairman Meeks has recognized as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have a high school group here with us today. Two different high school groups. That's why there's two of us. Pellam High School and from down in mind, that's the woods in Macon County with Stephen. And we wanted to thank them for coming. It's about a four-hour ride for them to be here. So they got a part of this morning and drove up this morning. They're going to drive home today. So they did all this to see what we do. So I hope we impress them. But the organization they are part of and our representing is family, career, community, leaders of America. And it focuses on family. And I feel like if we had that group prevalent in all of our schools, we'd have a lot less problems than we do today. They're doing great. So if I could get you all to stand up. Thank you all for coming. They got the red jacket on. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Representative. And thank you all for being here today, making the trip up. We appreciate you all being here. Safe trip home. Chair recognizes representing Crawford, Bentley, and Samson for a morning order. Good morning. You're recognized. Good morning, Mr. Speaker, distinguished body, friends, and guests. I am Omar E. Crawford. And it's my distinct pleasure to recognize some men that you may see in the capital today, members of Omega Scythe 5 fraternity and corporate. No, this is just not a fashion piece. But we have our annual visit on the capital. I am Omar E. Crawford from the DeCab County District, District 84. Omega Scythe 5 fraternity and corporate was founded on November 17, 1911 at Howard University, making it the first international fraternal organization to be founded at a historically black college and university. The founders, Dr. Ernest Jess Bishop, Edgar Love, Dr. Oscar Cooper, and Professor Frank Coleman chose the phrase, friendship is essential to the soul as the fraternities model. And I thank everyone in here can understand the value of true friendship, manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift are the fraternities, and the four-cartinal principles, because real men of Omega should uplift their communities. Real Omega's surrender service to those who needed to the extent that their resources allow. And should any Omega do anything to deviate intentionally from those cartinal principles, then he has violated his oath and his membership should be in jeopardy. I'm excited to recognize some of the members that are here today, but I think I need to recognize a few members for this body of the members of Omega, Hank Johnson, the Congressional of Georgia's fourth congressional district, Dr. Kevin James, the president of Morris Brown College, Dr. Brian Blake, the president of Georgia State, and last and certainly not least, a person who was no stranger to any of us the former dean of this house, Mr. Calvin Smirrey, future ambassador to the Bahamas, is also a member of Omega. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Quite a distinguished list there, Representative Crawford, and I look at that jacket. Yes. It was my size, I'd borrow it tomorrow. And I think it's a little slim on me. Representative Stacy Evans is recognized for morning order. He should be joined by Chairman Tarvan, carpenter, representative Yehoner, and representative Cameron. Are you sure you want all these guys with you? I am sure, Mr. Speaker. You're recognized, Representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thanks for checking on me. The great, we got some Northwest Georgia folks in the house this morning. I am so excited and honored and proud to live in and represent the city of Atlanta, but a lot of y'all know a big part of my heart resides and will always stay up in Northwest Georgia and Ringled, which is why I'm very excited today to represent, to recognize a group of student leaders that are here from Northwest Georgia in the family, career, and community leaders of America organization. We've got students from Ringled High School, my alma mater, Rigelon High School, Southeast Whitfield High School, Northwest Whitfield, Tatuga, Dague County, and the Northwest Georgia College and Career Academy. They will be here for a little while. If you get a chance, please speak to them. They are the future leaders of America and Georgia and among them, a special shout out to my niece, Alana Godfrey. Hopefully she will be in this body with us one day. And if they will please stand so that we can recognize them. I hope you'll join me in welcoming them to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You also had to represent Ridley with you. I missed him. He didn't always good to have folks from home here, but especially young folks. Welcome to your house. Representing Cameron, don't get going. Representing Cameron, you recognize for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. Representative Tarvin and I like to recognize it. I don't know they've made it to the galley yet, but the future farmers of America from Walker County are here today. They're a great bunch of young men and women, and I'm currently working on a project with Regal in high school in Walker County because they do goat showing. Goat showing is a big thing up in Walker County. So anyway, I want to recognize them and welcome to the Capitol. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Representative Crow, Mr. Wade patiently. He's recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today is the Butts County Day at the Capitol. We have a large group of representatives from Butts County, make up of some of our county commissioners, members of the leadership Butts County class, Chamber, Sheriff's Office, and several other organizations. So we'd like to welcome them here, and we've got one group over here on the right-hand side and one group over on the left-hand side. So we can get them to stand and welcome them to the Capitol. I'll appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. And welcome to the Capitol. Well, I'm a little challenged by this next one. I can just tell you. I don't know how I missed this representative, Williams. We should have been there. If it didn't, there was a dance-off between the House and the Senate. I need your attention. A dance-off between the House and the Senate. If everyone knows about that. But evidently, we had a great team. It was comprised of Chairman LeHood, Corbett, and I welcome these dancers down front. Dickie Jenkins, Mathis. Oh, man. Mathis. Yes. Chokus, Tram, and Work-Ozor. Did I miss anyone? I really need Representative Danny Mathis to be down here. Is he here? I know he's here. Okay. Thank you. Wait a minute. Now, I'm waiting just to do gentlemen. There he comes. We have to have the Baptist Convention recognized in part of this whole deal. All right. Let's see. Let's do him again. Did I get everyone? Yeah, we need a little demonstration. Could we get some music? All right. Chairman LeHood is recognized to tell us what happened. All right. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. And members, if you were not at the first ever House versus Senate dance-off, you missed a good time. Our friend in the hallway, Terry Lindell, sponsored the event. And these gentlemen in our spouses joined us for a really good time. And we had fun and saw a lot of funny things. And so our secret weapon, I have to say, was Mr. Representative Danny Mathis. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Let's go Danny. Yeah. Well, like you said, Danny Mathis was our secret weapon. Well, he got out there. You heard of the, you know, staying alive, you know, John Travolta and the BG's. He was I will, Barry you. Barry you. It was amazing. Anyway, Mr. Speaker, we are all at the Senate. The Senate could do when we finished with just by all their heads because they knew that they'd been beat. They laid this shiny trophy right here at the House members' feet. We told him once we told him twice just come on back if you want to try again. All this house does is win. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right. All right. Is there a video? Is there a video? That's what I will, we'll play it. Representative Mathis. If you would demonstrate as you go back down the center aisle to your door. You can't make that stuff up. I'm just telling you. Wow. Thank you, gentlemen. I tell you all, we got the polls just for a second. I got to go to picture. This may never happen again. Nobody will believe this one. Chairman Tauvin is recognized. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it possible we could just have an event not telling anybody about it, not know who the competition was? I apologize to these men. They're all friends of mine, but I couldn't get too excited unless I saw the competition. Well, you're right there, Chairman Tauvin. I was just learning there was not much competition from the Senate. But I want to be on this calendar next year. I want to go watch this one. Chairman Lai to recognize the former member who's in the gallery today representing Buzz Brockway. This welcome representing Buzz Brockway. Hey, Buzz. Good to see you. That completes our announcements. We will move on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to HB 129. House Bill 129. To be entitled back to men. Chapter 4, title 49. The fiscal to Georgia antenna related public assistance. So it's expand temporary assistance for needy families. eligibility criteria to pregnant women. This bill I'm referring to committee on public health. I committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representing Sioux Hall to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, colleagues. I am presenting to you House Bill 129. It's LC 33 9271-EC. The bill is going to expand TANF, which is temporary assistance for needy families. Where pregnant women will now be eligible to receive benefits. As many of you know, TANF is received by federal block grant. There are certain eligibility requirements including work requirement, etc. There are a lot of very needy families that are taking advantage of TANF benefits. This bill will go ahead and extend that to pregnant women. This is a good bill. It is one of the governor's initiatives and I'm happy to be carrying it on behalf of the governor. I will take any questions. I will take any questions. You do have a question. The gentleman from the 1st 70th has a question. Excuse me, the lady from the 1st 70th, I beg your pardon. Is this your first bill? Yes, ma'am. Do you plan to introduce anything else in health? In health? No, not this session. No, no. Well, you did a great job. Thank you so much. Did she say it was her first bill? Yes. It is. She even had a visual aid to go along with that first bill. You do have a question. You do have one more question I see. The gentleman from the 1st 76th has recognized that she will yield for her question. Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does General Lee lead yield? I do. I was digging into this bill here. It's a pretty substantial bill here. One of the things that stuck out to me was on your LC number. It's LC33-9271-EC. Is that correct? It is. What is that EC stand for? It stands for Executive Council, which means that it is a governor's bill versus the legislative council of drafting it. Thank you for that question. Very good. Thank you. Lady Yulfe, another question? I do. Let's get one all the way in the back to your, in front of you on the left, representative Bentley from the 1st 50th has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's the general lady yield. I do. I understand that this is your first bill. Yes, ma'am. Can you explain to me how this bill will impact the funeral home industry? How it will impact the funeral industry? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I do not see it impacting the funeral industry at this point, especially because this is a cash benefit for needy families and for pregnant women. I hope that it does not impact the funeral industry. Thank you. Thank you, thanks for answering the question. Thank you. Thank you, representative. Lady Yulfe, one more question, maybe two more. One more, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. One more, Mr. Speaker. Let's recognize the gentleman from the 6th representing Ridley. I think he's right over here where you sit in that area. You could have asked this question probably and saved this time from the seat mate. But, gentleman has recognized for a question. Well, now I'm confused by any desk question or so you shut up. There's a general lady yield. I do. So you know what I guess you've seen since you've been here is usually a customary on your first bill to give you a hard time. Can since you brought one, the first ones I've seen in seven years that we can't make a joke about. Can we wait for your next second time to build a hard on you? I think today's time was it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. We have a good job. We have a speaker signed up. Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And that visual aid is actually mine. So today I rise to speak in support of HB 129. And I'll note I actually have special attachment to this bill because last week a legislative aid came to find me in the anti-room over there. Telling me that he had a form for me to fill out to present my bill HB 129 in rules. At which point I told him while I wish I did have a bill to present out of committee already he was actually looking for representative. Here's a hint for everyone. We do wear name tags. So HB 129 is a good bill. I was glad to vote for it in the public health committee last week and in a few minutes I look forward to voting for it again. But I think we'd be in remiss not to take this opportunity to look at our 10 qualifications overall as they have not been updated in the last three decades. And let's ensure that we are in fact having the effect we think we will be having by passing this bill. So let's refer to this visual aid over here. So let's look at where Georgia is with respect to its qualification requirements for TANF for a family of three meaning a mother with two children. Now this is going to be some math. Okay, no, it's like we're challenging people to Monday morning after the Super Bowl. So to qualify for TANF benefits this parent must earn less than $784 a month and have countable assets less than $1,000. So let's calculate this out and this amounts to an annual salary of less than $9,408 per year which is 40% of the federal poverty level. And you can see that calculation right up there. This means that 60% of very impoverished parents earning below the federal poverty level earn too much money to qualify for TANF assistance. Further, to qualify for TANF benefits this parent must also work a minimum 30 hours a week. Doing this math for a 52 week year this amounts to 1,560 hours worked per year. So recall though that this parent cannot earn more than $9,400 an eight dollars per year which means that that person's hourly salary must be below $6.03 per hour. This is well below the federal minimum wage which is $7.25 per hour. So let's do a little bit more math. Please indulge me. In order to work a job and to raise a family a parent has to do a number of things and have a number of set expenses, right? Dipers, laundry detergent, children's medications, gas or fair for public transportation. TANF benefits have not been updated since 1991 which I suspect sadly is before some members of this chamber were even born. What has happened to the price of these goods and services in the past 32 years? So it should be no surprise to anyone that the cost of living is much higher now, right? The cost of toilet paper has tripled since 1991 so has the cost of laundry detergent. You'll like this. In 1991, gas cost 88 cents a gallon. Can you imagine that? And in 1991, a one-way Marta Fair cost $1 while now it cost $2.50. 30 years ago, a nominal TANF grant for a family of three was $280. In 2023, now, a nominal TANF grant for a family of three is still $280. So because this has not been updated in more than three decades the math simply does not add up. The qualification criteria has not changed less than a third of the number of families now qualify for TANF as where eligible when the program was originally enacted more than 30 years ago. So I know some people in this chamber might be thinking that's good, right? We should have fewer people receiving these benefits. That's the point. But that depends on what your goals are, right? If our goal is to have as few families as possible qualifying for temporary aid due to extreme and harsh financial circumstances, then yes, we are serving that goal. But if our goal as stated in the presentation, the excellent presentation of H.R.129 is to help improve peri-natal health and alleviate hardships per perspective and current parents, then no TANF in its current form does not fully or best serve these goals. So let's all vote yes on 128, right? Let's mash that green button, right? But let's continue this conversation and look to update in Georgia's TANF criteria to match the financial realities of the present day. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to yield four questions. The lady does have a question. Representative Oliver to your extreme left over here has a question. Does the lady you absolutely not only was I born, I was here when we did this in the 90s. So I remember all this very well ending welfare as we know it. We've gone from providing TANF benefits to several hundred thousand families. Isn't it?

true, ma'am, that the only number of folks that might be eligible for this benefit is approximately 300 Georgians out of 140,000 ladies having birth this year. Gentlewoman knows of what she speaks. And if you complied with the rules, the antiquated rules, the antiquated numbers, you would not be eligible because working full-time, 30 hours, would make you financially and eligible. Isn't that true? Gentlewoman makes an excellent point and I refer again to the math on the board. Thank you. Lady has no further questions. If there are no further questions, I yield the welcome. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. Report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. Will the passage of the bill, the yeas were 173, the nays won, the bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations on your first bill. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 139. House Bill 139, I represent a crow of the 118th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 16 and title 17. The official code of Georgia annotated relating the discovery and criminal procedure. So as we provide for restrictions, the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information of non sworn employees of law enforcement agencies. This bill ever refer to the committee on judiciary non-sevil that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The gentleman from the 118th, is that where you're from? 118th, Representative Crowe to present the bill. The colleague, this is House Bill 139. This is a bill we had last session passed by a vote of 156 to zero. So I hope we can replicate or exceed that this year. This is a GBI bill. I was brought to us in hopes that we could get some parity in the law for law enforcement officers. So when law enforcement officers currently, when they are a witness for the prosecution, by virtue of their jobs with the law enforcement organization, they're not required to give personal identifying information such as their home address, birth date, or personal phone number to the defense as part of a witness list. Those current, those exceptions do not currently move over to non sworn employees. So crime scene technicians, lab technicians, DNA scientists, they don't have those same protections. This bill would seek to change that, would add them to the list of those excluded from having to give their personal information. And then we also cleared up a concern that some had with this process by making sure that if someone leaves the agency, whether they're sworn or non sworn, that they have to maintain the contact information with their former agency, so they can be notified to receive service for court dates and subpoenas. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield for questions. Gentlemen, yields for a question? I do. Representative Huddleston, do you have a question, gentlemen, from the second? Well, your buttons, ma'am. You don't have, you wave? I wave, it's our— Thank you, Representative. You need to manage your button a little better with everything, I mean. You need to take it with you when you leave, evidently. Chairman Martin is recognized for a question of the gentleman with you. Gentlemen, yield? I do. This is a serious question. In rules we talked about, sworn and non sworn, so that's everybody. It's your—isn't it true, even though the bill's written like this, this should include everybody under the employee of these specific organizations, correct? Yes, sir, if they're called upon to testify for the prosecution in a criminal trial. Further questions, further yield? Yes. And this would include, if someone for whatever reason wasn't necessarily a W2 employee, but was a contractor, a 1099 employee, if they were under the employee of these organizations, called upon to testify, it is your belief that this would also cover those individuals as well. Yes, sir, that's correct. Thank you. You have no further questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration and I yield well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 174, the nay zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We're moving on to afternoon orders. Representative Yadanya is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am Representative Shagun Adena of House District 110. For starters, black history is United States history. United States history is black history. I celebrate black history, US history, because I stand here today as a member of this great body as one of the first Nigerian Caribbean Americans to be elected in this great state of Georgia into the general, Georgia General Assembly. My favorite line when reciting the Star Spangled Banner is, or the land of the free and the home of their brave. Understanding the fight for freedom at all costs and the bravery of Harriet Tubman, Rita Daniels, Geraldine Cope's Daniels, and Pauline Cope's Johnson inspire my celebration. White Tubman, according to her words, through the underground railroad, risk life and limb to guide more than 70 enslaved people north to freedom and new lives, although legend has it that she freed more than 300 people. Five generations later, one of her descendants, Rita Daniels of Marietta, Georgia, in 2016 started the Harriet Tubman Learning Center. The center was established to directly impact the deep rooted and grim problem of literacy in US communities, with a focus on science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Steam, for the sustainability of academic success for participating students, the center aims to provide freedom for illiteracy for any brave child willing to risk it all for their future. The slogan keep going, don't give up, which is their slogan captures the essence of what it takes to be free. Miss Daniel was encouraged by both her late mother, Geraldine Cope's Daniels, who passed away two years ago at age of 87, and her aunt, Pauline Cope's Johnson, who is 96 years of age, and is the longest living descendant of Harriet Tubman. I met them both in Washington DC in 2017 at the Congressional Leadership Conference, at a conference of scientists and engineers, as you may guess. Their commitment to learning center and the importance of freeing young minds to recognize opportunities runs deep. Today, I salute Harriet Tubman, Rita Daniels, Geraldine Cope's Daniels, and the longest living descendant of Harriet Tubman, Miss Pauline Cope's Johnson. Thanks to Speaker. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Chairman Barr, excuse me, is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've asked to be joined up here by Representative Williams, Representative Hitchens, and Representative Deloge. We rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Operation Homecoming. From February 12, 1973 to April 4, there were 54 missions flying out of Hanoi, North Vietnam, bringing former POWs home. During the early part of Operation Homecoming, groups of POWs released were selected on the basis of the longest length of time in prison. The first group had spent six to eight years as prisoners of war. The last POWs were turned over to Allied hands in March 29, 1973, raising the total number of Americans returned to 591. Of the POWs repatriated the United States, 325 of them served the United States Air Force, 138 in the Navy, 77 in the Army, 26 in the Marines, and 25 civilian employees of American government agencies. A majority of the prisoners were held at camps in North Vietnam. However, some POWs were held at various locations throughout Southeast Asia. The prisoners returned, included former politicians, such as Senator John McCain of Arizona, Vice President Joe candidate James Stockdale, and Representative Sam Johnson of Texas. Georgia has always provided its best and brightest sons and daughters to serve this country during times of war and peace. More than 228,000 men and women from Georgia served during the Vietnam War. 1,584 Georgians were killed in action. 8,534 were wounded in action. 21 were held as prisoners of war. 28 Georgians are still unaccounted for, and 28 Georgians remains have been repatriated. 1,581 Americans are still missing an unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. The mission of Operation Homecoming continues as our nation is dedicated to bringing home our fallen and honoring those who gave their last full measure of devotion for our freedom. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, can I ask you something? I also this morning would like to ask you to remember a former member of this body who was held for five and a half years in solitary confinement. He was a ranking Army officer held by the North Vietnamese. Former State Representative and Army Colonel Ben Persale. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman DeLogge. Thank you, gentlemen. I know three of you. They're served in Vietnam, and thank you for your service. The sacrifices for our country is always humbling to us all. Representative Jasmine Clark and the Gwyneth delegation for an afternoon order. Good morning, colleagues. Last week, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Last week, tragedy struck the students and families at Meadow Creek High School as they lost. Many will suspend just for a second. Members, thank you. Continue. Last week, tragedy struck the students and families at Meadow Creek High School as they lost not one but two young souls and two separate incidences. Rodrigo Floriano Mayan, who was 17 years old, went missing and four days later they discovered his body in an abandoned home after an apparent drug overdose. Susanna Morales was 16 years old. She was missing for six months before her remains were discovered in a forest miles away from her home in a forest in D'Aquila. The Meadow Creek family is mourning and grieving as it is unconscionable to experience this much loss all at once. We please take a moment of silence with us in memory of these two beautiful souls gone too soon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Chair recognizes Chairman Tyler Paul Smith for an afternoon order. Members of your attention to this one as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of this house, today I rise in remembrance of Georgia State Patrol Sergeant Terry Pont Joe Thompson of Bowden, Georgia, who passed away on February of the 20th, 2023. He was only 57 years old. He was born on February of the 5th, 1966 in Atlanta to the late Robert Bob and Murdy's Thompson. He was a graduate of Bowden High School and a member of Bowden Badger's Church. He was a lifelong law enforcement officer having started his career in 1986 and his hometown of Bowden at the Bowden Police Department before moving on to the Georgia State Patrol where he worked for 25 years. And on to most, his Ponto, he was a friend of many and will be missed by those who knew him. I hope you will pray along with me for his wife, Don, his children, Crystal Wright and Heras, Mike and Core Thompson, his grandchildren, his nieces and nephews. Please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Mix is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, each and every week we come to Atlanta to do the people's work. We live our families and our spouses, our children and our home to take care of home. Today's a special day at home. Today is Joyce birthday.
