TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you you you attention here, if we'll, uh, everybody please take your seat if you can find one and we're going to get started here in just a moment Wow everybody got quite quickly, all right, well, we'll go ahead and get started now My name is John Alvers. I serve in the Georgia State Senate District 56, which is parts of Cobb Cherokee and Fulton County and I'm honored today to open this official first study committee for Senate Resolution 275 to order. We're gonna go through a little bit of logistics and setup for the speeding today. We're gonna hear from some of the folks who are gracious enough to host us here as well as we've got some speakers. So we're gonna go through this process hopefully in a very organized fashion. We have a list of people that we're speaking today. If you came here today in hopes of speaking to the committee and you were not already talked to on the agenda, we are we do not have room for that today. However, we're having five more meetings and if you do have an interest in speaking, please see myself or Ali Farmer who I believe is making sure everybody can get into this room right now. So we can look at a future agenda to possibly put you in. So let me begin by a little bit of history of how we got here today. Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones came to me early this legislative session and said one of his priorities was going to be workforce, both for who worked for the state as well as how we supported our private businesses and asked if I would be willing to chair a study committee to go all over our state of Georgia because we are a very unique and diverse state to find out how we as a state can better prepare the workforce for the future. Now that involved a lot of key areas from kindergarten and 12th grade to our technical college system or university system to our small businesses, our medium, our large businesses, our great partners for associations, chambers of commerce, businesses, alliances and all the folks that work together to make that perfect recipe which is Georgia's success. We are at the number one place to do business for nine years. I know we're all very proud of that. The only one problem with being number one is everyone wants to knock us off. So we have to continue to stay ahead of that and the workforce obviously is a key and critical component to doing that. So in a moment I'm going to ask each one of our committee members to just spend a few minutes to introduce themselves but aside from our regular committee we have a working committee set up and that working committee behind the scene is helping to provide a lot of the information that feeds into these meetings. So I want to take a moment to recognize some of those folks in our Senate press office who help put together logistics here and we're going to hear from them in a few minutes about the website and other things is Lexi Giuliani and Emily Leonard. We're very happy to have them. We also have he's on his way here right now Mr. Brad Vaughn. He is with the Lieutenant Governor's office. We have Haley Williams with our Senate Research team. We have Miss Sean Marie Story who is one of our steam legislative council members who gets to write all the laws that we come up with. And then last but not least I think all of you have heard from Ali Farmer who is in my office who is helping to do a lot of the scheduling putting together. So that's an important group for you to know and as we continue throughout this process if you have questions please direct it to anyone up to and including me if I can best serve you. I want to talk about our meeting schedule first and you'll see more of this when Lexi gives an review of the website but our next meeting is going to be held in July 25th and lovely Savannah Georgia. Georgia's first city and there is in your folders for the committee members. There's a cheat sheet for you. August 22nd will be out at West Point at the key of plant. September 29th will be in commerce somewhere either at or next to SK innovations. Oh I'm sorry 19th. Thank you. October 26th will be up in the Dalton area and then we will have the final meeting which will be November the 14th back at the Georgia Capitol. The 14th of November will we culminate in us creating a report that Haley will talk about in a little bit but I've already asked her to start and that will be our recommendations and findings from this committee. From those recommendations and findings several things could happen. That could be the beginning of us creating legislation in order to make necessary updates and changes to Georgia code. It could be budgetary items where we want to make more investments. It could just be things that we're going to do as a state through different teams and different groups and different departments in order to help continue fostering the workforce to make sure that we are prepared for what we are going to have in the future which is hopefully many many more years of Georgia being the best place to live, work, play, raise a family and certainly operate a business. So at this time on do is I'm going to pass the microphone down. I'm going to walk it down to the end for Dave first and then we'll pass it down this way to do a quick introduction. Chairman thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Dave Williams. I serve as the senior vice president for public policy and talent at the Metro Atlanta Chamber and talent as I think is no surprise to anyone talents the most pressing challenge that our employers and members face and so we're happy to be participant and hope we can contribute. Thank you. Hello everyone. Jason Estevez, the proud state senator for state senate district six which is northwest Atlanta, parts of Cobb and Fulton County also an attorney and small business owner, former educator, sat on the school board and Atlanta.

I'm Steve Saird from the four central district. The main thing I tell people when people say what which district is that I say well that's that was Jack Hills district. Oh yeah I know what that is. But that's all of Evans County which is Jackson, all of Cannell County which is matter, all of Bullet County which is state for all of Effingham County which is Rankin and Springville and about 30 thousand people down in the Goddard station area of Pula. So I'm very happy to be. I am also a CPA, a small business owner. We got about 40 accountants with us. So all this stuff kind of makes a good bit of sense to me. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Good afternoon. I am Senator Sonia Halper in representing district 39 which is right here in Fulton County in the Atlanta area in South. My district is the most social economically diverse district in the state. As it relates to me personally I have been in business, I have been in not for profit and philanthropy and always concerned and excited about issues of opportunity and so economic opportunity is always the foundation. And so I'm excited about the work that we'll be doing here and glad to be joining all of you in the effort. Hello my name is Greg Dozier. I'm commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia and just proud to be here because our main mission and focus is workforce development. So I appreciate all the support and all the focus. Good afternoon. My name is Danielle Alapari. I serve as the Vice President of the Georgia Chamber Foundation for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce where the state's largest business advocacy organization and the War for Talent is the top priority of our membership. Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I'm William Smith and I'm a hero on behalf of Delta Airlines.

I myself am a small business owner. I live in Roswell and I think each member of this committee is going to bring a very unique perspective as we move forward. At this time I'd like to ask Mr. Walt Farrell to come on up and give us a little welcome from Georgia Power. Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Walt Farrell. I'm a vice president of community and economic development here at Georgia Power. It is our privilege to host the study committee members of the audience here today for this discussion. Large part of what we do is partner with the Department of Economic Development to attract new business to the state. Obviously as the number one state to do business for the last nine years in a row we're proud to be a part of that team that's helping attract new industry. We're also focused on community development so around the state working with community leaders to help them understand the assets and attributes that they have locally to recruit new business to attract talent and to build a workforce pipeline. The really the third pillar of our organization is education and workforce development. You'll hear more from Jamal Jesse who's going to talk to you today a little bit about that and the different areas that we support the state around workforce and education. Again, privilege to host you guys and proud to be here. Thanks. Walt thank you so much. We appreciate it. All right next I'm going to ask Lexi to come up with our Senate Press Office to tell you about some of our technology and logistics for the committee. Yes sir thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. So glad that you all are here. I'm just going to give you all a quick tour of our website. As we were the working group for this committee was meeting we worked with Chairman Albers to develop a website to kind of be a hub for information for those who are interested in the work of the committee as well as a place for people to provide remote testimony to the committee or written testimony to the committee through the website. So I'll just give you all a quick overview. If you're wanting to follow along on your own devices or if you're watching the live stream at home you're looking for expanding George's workforce study.com. Again that's expanding George's workforce study.com. So just very quickly here on the homepage if you click on about you'll be able to see a little bit more about the resolution that created the committee as well as all of the members of the committee. Next we have our meeting schedule as Chairman Albers alluded to. We have some upcoming meetings our next one is going to be in Savannah. I believe after that we we're going to West Point. So all of the details are here. You can click into each one of these and as we get parking information and all of that sort of thing for those who are interested in attending will actually compile all of that here. So for any of those people who will be traveling all of that information will live here once we get official meeting notices and logistics hammered out. But if you're not able to make it to one of these six meetings we're going to be going all around the state as well as having a final meeting at the capital. If you're not able to join us at one of those meetings and you still would like to submit written testimony to the committee we actually have a Google form here on the website if you just click on submit testimony. And this is where you can give first name last name organization and submit a statement to the committee if you have particular bits of data or links that you would like to share. And so that will live in a Google drive that will be available to the committee members. It'll be published as a part of as an appendix in the final report of the committee. So feel free to go online and submit remarks there. After this meeting is concluded we actually are going to be traveling to live stream and record all of the committee meetings as they take place throughout the state. So all of those will live here where it says video archives on the committee. And then as the committee decides we will publish news and any documents reports, overviews anything that the chairman and the rest of the committee sees fit we can publish here. And so as documents are coming out of this committee and as work is coming out of this committee all of this will be available on this website. And I believe that concludes the tour. So yeah feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about what might be on the website. My contact information is at the footer so y'all just feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Great job, Luxy. Thank you very much. You'll see that we're going to try and do most things electronically both through the committee but to make sure that we're being very transparent and inclusive with everybody who wants to participate you will find all the information there and I do want to say for anybody who might be watching us via live stream that doesn't have the opportunity to travel. As Luxy mentioned to please communicate and fill out that forum and send your information over to us because we do want to hear from you. We understand that not all the Georgians can make it to these meetings but every Georgian can certainly participate in this process. So thank you for doing that. I'm going to ask all the committee members. We already have the Senate headshots but if not if you'll send us a headshot so we can put that on the website. I would appreciate that and Billy Hickman sent over his high school mug shots so I'm trying to get a more current picture. Next we're going to I'm going to pass a microphone down to Haley. Haley is with our Senate Research Office. I want to take a moment to explain the great work they do for us. We are a part-time legislature which means we work about 80 hours a week for a little bit of pay. Seriously though the having the groups of people such as our legislative council or Senate press and our Senate research is critical to the work that each one of us gets to do when we're either in legislative session or like the things we're doing right now are and we really rely heavily on Haley and that team to help us out. Before I pass the microphone down I want to let the committee members know that Haley being part of our group will help us don't don't go crazy trying to find things yourself when she's got an awesome team of people that can help us out. So let's make sure we funnel our quest through that and we also have one place that will keep all that information together. It would be really important because we're going to get a lot of different information from different sources and she'll really be the glue that holds us together. Thank you. Okay. My name is Haley Williams. I'm going to give this presentation from my seat because you don't need to see me anyways but I do want to start off as Chairman Albers mentioned. I am responsible for producing the comprehensive final report that comes out of the study committee. So any suggestions that come from the committee members or otherwise should all come to me. Also housekeeping matter. Any prospective speakers should be sending me any materials at least two business days prior to the meeting at which you plan to speak because it needs to be screened. So other than that let me save this works. Oh okay cool. So I would like to preface with a couple of disclaimers. First of all regarding the data. Everything that you're going to hear does come from official sources and it's the most up-to-date information that is publicly available. However, a lot of the annual reports that are referenced through here are updated in the fall of the year following. So a lot of this is going to be reflective of 2021 but it won't be you know terribly far off and a full list of references will be included with this presentation when it is uploaded to the website. Also regarding content this could be a two-day seminar and I'm going to just do this in about 15 minutes so keep in mind that this is an overview. It is not meant to be comprehensive if I leave something off. It's not personal. It's just an accident. So just kidding. Just kidding. Moving on just to give you an idea of where we're going to go. I'm going to cover little information about the current workforce and then some info about the top industries in Georgia and then some of our workforce development initiatives in the state particularly in the last five to 10 years. So start us off. Georgia has a workforce with about 5.1 million people. As you can see on employment rates 3.4 percent that's actually up a little from last year but there are a lot of reasons for that and for your information these are the top five occupational groups in the state. This is where the majority of Georgians are employed one way or the other. As you can see I've got a little five-year information and then more recent. So between 2017 and 2021 Georgia did add 130,000 new jobs to the workforce and despite having a huge drop in job openings in April 2020 this is an interesting step to me. There was one opening for every four unemployed people and by July 22 there were four three openings for every unemployed person. So great sign bouncing back quickly during the first half of FY 23 the most jobs were created outside of the metro area which has been a pretty big problem in Georgia over the past several years. Rural workforce development is a lot more difficult than metro Atlanta development. So Atlanta is the sixth most sought-after location for professionals to migrate to and unfortunately that doesn't take us down to Valdosta for employment purposes. Okay a lot of text on this but I'm going to go through several of Georgia's top industries starting with advanced manufacturing which does it does encompass pretty much every sector in the state but about 300,000 Georgians do work in some kind of production capacity. Of course there's aerospace, automotive, defense, food processing, life sciences. Aerospace, automotive, defense and food processing are pretty straightforward. Life sciences will include things like insulin pumps and other medical devices but it could also be more like intellectual type productions such as in the pharmaceutical realm. Also digital health as in you know telehealth and other things that are available through technology. Of course we have agribusiness which is the leading industry and energy which the Department of Economic Development estimates will invest five billion dollars in the state within the next decade and then logistics and supply chain. Georgia is really well known for a very robust logistics and infrastructure system. Obviously we all know that Hartzill Jackson is incredibly busy and efficient. The Portis Savanna is incredibly busy nowadays. It's only getting busier. It's actually the number one export. It's the number one port for exporting automotive and that's a recent statistic as well. Hartz Film TV production obviously we all know about the very attractive tax incentives for the film industry that they're bringing about four billion dollars into the economy every year. Tourism which includes hotels also you know the fees that we get from Airbnb's but also little tourism things. The classic definition of tourism is one of the largest industries in Georgia as well and then corporate innovation. We always hear Georgia refer to Silicon Valley of the South. Obviously these are I'm sorry I don't mean to keep saying obviously these innovation centers are scattered throughout the metro area mostly and it's only growing as well and then technology which encompasses cybersecurity data centers financial technology an interesting fact payment processing firms in Georgia handles 70% of the transactions in the United States. I find that fascinating not sure if you guys do. Now onto our workforce initiatives that are already existing in Georgia. Most of it is based in education because talent is made and not necessarily brought in all the time. So I'll go through I'll go through a little bit of information that's related to K through 12 education specifically then post-secondary and then some other things that are a little of both. First of all in our K through 12 systems we have got a great dual enrollment program that has expanded significantly over the last several years as well as participation has grown significantly. CTA-CTAE programs which include mostly you know technical and agricultural things they are very successful there are several career clusters or pathways that students can participate in in school that sets them up to either receive certificates or test for one. College and career academies have become really popular throughout the state. They actually do collaborate with different people in the community to work on workforce development initiatives and public private partnerships with schools and local businesses and larger businesses. For example I've got this text drawn company that is in Augusta and they've actually developed their own program that works with the school system there to bring in you know lower income and higher risk students to actually train them to do jobs that they can continue after graduation. Higher education initiatives we have USG we also have TCSG. TCSG arguably has a lot more specific programs that lend themselves to workforce development but USG has some interesting things. These are just a couple of highlights from USG. A new tool that just came out recently the career resource planning platform is from what I've heard a very comprehensive sort of one stop shop for career planning and it connects students with actual alumni and people that are in the workforce currently who can give them direct advice and give them more realistic ideas about what to expect after graduation and what sort of skills that they actually need rather than you know algebra and things like that and then the next is degree program is particularly interesting it's a different credential it would you know parallel a BA or something like that and they also are available to people who don't even have degrees if they just want to teach themselves about a certain skill set in an industry that they already work in or if they want to make a move these programs are available and the first graduates of with this credential graduated from Columbus State in December of 2020 and I haven't heard much about what they have to say about the program but it was successful at least for them and then TCSG we'll talk quite a bit about they have a number of free resources for those who don't have degrees at all people who want to take their GED exam TCSG has also recently been given the authority to grant a high school equivalency diploma so they offer prep courses for those exams the Hooc career grant also covers 100% of tuition or up to it for these high demand fields and there are also courses that are they don't offer any sort of credit or any sort of certificate but they will set you up for exams to get certifications related to an industry that a professional currently works in they also have included a nursing reentry program because that has been very important as we all know with the pandemic it was a everyone was scrambling to get more nurses in and TCSG stepped up to the plate TCSG also has a workforce division of course Mr. Dozier will have to correct me if any of this is a little off but the workforce division is responsible for administering funds throughout the state grant funds for they administer grant funds Georgia quick start has been ranked for 13 years now as the number one workforce development tool in the country I am unsure of who decides on these rankings but it is very popular and it comes up in so many articles and reports and things when I was doing research for this I was very impressed at how Georgia quick start is actually used as sort of a template for other states who are trying to get some sort of tool like this but for certain businesses particularly new businesses small ones they can get some free training and free resources from this program to maximize their potential for success so I'm actually almost done to finish up Georgia sees talent and skill as a renewable resource as I said before it's not something that needs to be imported but it all starts in education and I think that Georgia has done a great job at capitalizing on this but we can always do more most of our initiatives are education based and that's sort of inherent and if anyone has any questions I'll be happy to field them this was an overwhelming amount of information to put into a short time but thank you all for listening thank you Haley that was a lot of information the reason why we wanted to do a quick overview that was to set a foundation for everyone I hope what you realize is lots of good things are happening in Georgia right now great coordination great work

from all the different areas that we provide from the public and private sector. So you might be thinking, well, then why are we having this committee job? Because we have to do even better now. You saw when Haley was presenting how many job openings there are versus people available to take those jobs. But we've also learned is whether it is a kid who is pretty much made of their mind by middle school what they want to do. Or it's an adult who now decided to make a career change or the field they were in before is being sunsetted for a new opportunity. There's things that we have to continue to do better and better each and every day. One of the things that the Lieutenant Governor asked to do and we passed into law was Senate Bill 3 this year. And that was primarily on the government side where we create job requirements like each and every one of you must do in the private marketplace. And you create a job description and you'll post a job description. What we found in the state is some of our stuff was a little bit out of date. And in some cases we were missing the very best and brightest and talent because of that and I actually used a couple of examples for technology jobs we had. Some of them had required 10 years of experience. But the software had only been around for three. Some of them required college degrees but Bill Gates could not apply for those jobs who created Microsoft because he did not graduate from college. So we have to find the unique balance to make sure that we're not ever undervalued education because it's very important. But at the same point we do not want to over educate to the point where people have a large amount of student debt and they don't have a job that's going to be able to have that return on investment for them in the future. So we have a lot of options here again it's really to connect the dots which is a lot we're going to do in this committee. I've got it. Okay. This one we're going to switch to start hearing testimony from folks today. And again I want to remind everybody if you're not on our agenda today to please reach out to us either via directly or through the website or email whatever is your preferred method of communication. We will not be able to hear from each and every Georgia there's not going to be enough time on this committee meetings. But some cases we will consolidate folks together to help represent certain industries or certain areas again knowing that very unique in each and every part of our state as has already been mentioned. So we're going to begin again we're going to go back to Georgia Power. Jamal if you would come up please sir and present at the microphone. We'd love to hear about the workforce needs from from Georgia Power and thanks for keeping the lights on. Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Jamal Jesse and workforce development is for Georgia Power. And today I'll talk to you a little bit about some of the workforce challenges we're seeing across the state as well as some of the work that we're doing at Georgia Power to address some of those challenges. So Haley I applaud you you did a great job with your data points. You actually took a couple of minds but one thing I did want to highlight is that the 5.1 million workers in the workforce is a great number. It's a high number. It's a number that's high in pre pandemic. 180,000 Georgia's unemployed at the high to pandemic in 2020 in March. She was 600,000 and unemployment at 3.2%. So we should be in a good position. But when you go to your communities that's not what we're hearing. We're hearing that we're having problems filling vacancies. We're hearing that we're having challenges with people with skills. And basically there's just a lot of issues that we're realizing that's going on right now that although we have a strong workforce, there's a lot of opportunities to improve it. So one, a couple of things that I've kind of noticed as well as our research team that are causing some of these issues are for one, record job creation. We have large job creation. New projects comes to the state. The second is skills mismatch. We have 54% of the jobs in Georgia require less than a 40 degree, but more than a high school diploma. So that's very important that we look at the skills mismatch. And then also there's over 800,000 Georgians that don't have a high school diploma or GED. So obviously that's a huge problem to solve for one group. So that's why we're here to work with you all and collaborate with our partners across the state, business industry, government education to kind of look at addressing those challenges. And at Georgia Power we have three focus areas that we support building a building a workforce of the future, stringing education and supporting policy and funding. So I'll talk a little bit more about building the workforce of the future. And that's how we partner with our communities to grow economic development and work with them to help grow their workforce. And a couple of different things that we're doing with them is as we heard about these different projects coming to the state and working with those communities, we realized that a lot of communities didn't really have a plan. They didn't have a roadmap to address some of these new job creations and influx of work coming to the industry. So we work with the confidence and instant to develop a workforce state planning guy. So this gives communities a chance to identify their market, look at the supply and demand needs of the workforce and really kind of build out a strategic plan of how they can address this and make sure that they have a plan in place to make sure that we are creating opportunities for Georgians as well as meeting the needs of business industry. A second thing we talked about is our work with the technical ecosystem of Georgia. At the TCSG we have eight electrical line worker programs and these are great programs that really help us grow our workforce at Georgia Power. These pre-apprenticeship programs really help with the skills mismatch that we realize and a lot of students that are coming into workforce aren't able to go into the jobs at Georgia Power as well as our industry partners. So the partnerships with the TCSG has been very beneficial to not only Georgia Power but as well as the industry. And then also I will share a little bit about the work that we're doing with Hyundai down in the JDA down there in Savannah, Chatham, Evan Hammond, Bullet Counties. We are working with them to identify their markets as they have 8,000 plus jobs coming to that region to look at where the opportunities are with us to supply demand at that particular market, how are they looking to address the needs of Hyundai as well as their suppliers and just making sure that they have a industry plan in place to address the needs for the auto industry and the EV market that's coming out to that region. The next thing I want to talk about is our work with strength and education. We align with the Georgia Department of Education to support Georgia's standards of excellence. We have an organization that's called Learning Power and Learning Power is a group of educators that go out to K-12 schools. We teach Angie Efficiency lessons to students and we align those with the Georgia standards of excellence and ensure that they are aligned with the curriculum developments to introduce students to STEM as well as Angie Efficiency opportunities across the state. The next thing I want to talk about is our work with CTAE and Cosmic Career Academies. We are working with the CTAE to make sure that pathways are aligned to key industries to ensure that students that are going into those have the right skills to be ready to go into the workforce as well as we're working with our economic development to make sure that school districts have economic development certifications to make sure that they are in partnership with economic development, business and education to ensure that those school districts are preparing students for the opportunities that are ahead. And then the other group, the other thing I want to add is our work with teacher externships. Just left Georgia Power. We are welcoming 14 teachers to our organization for three days of externships. They'll go around and learn about different parts of the business. Kind of ride around a bucket truck, see the work that Georgia Power does. So that way they can take that message back to their students and talk to them about those careers. So when that student decides to graduate college or high school, they can consider Georgia Power or our industry as a particular employer of choice. Last thing I want to talk about is our funding policy funding work to address education and workforce training needs. We are Georgia Power Foundation by Angie has a workforce grant that they work with schools to provide for new pathways as well as existing pathways. This again helps align with the needs of the industry and make sure schools have pathways in place that are training people to go into those jobs and meet industry standard needs. So this was just a little bit of work that we're doing at Georgia Power. We realized that by partnering with our government leaders as well as our education partners, nonprofit partners that we can all kind of collaboratively work to do this work and make sure that we actually work, build Georgia, our power, build Georgia a workforce for the future. Any questions? First of all, we just say thank you for this great presentation. I think I've got a question from Senator Hick. Well, I think it's more of a statement in question, but we're actually seeing because I didn't really know what college and career academy was till I got into Senate. I've become a big fan and it was course in the social we don't call them that we're going pathways. We haven't got you technical college there. But one thing that they're doing in our area, go stream in the ports authority are now reaching down into the high school level. And taking some of these children students, taking some of these students out of high school and doing internships with them. So they're actually kind of like a football now. So they actually dropping down the folder and realizing they got to go down to the 10th grade and sort of identifying kids and put them in internships. So hopefully get them at that level. I'm a big fan of that. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. I didn't catch the name of the program, but I wanted to hear a little bit more when you talked about how you're working with school districts and aligning them with economic development. I love the concept and I know that some of my children too have been in schools where the principal himself has said my job isn't to get you out of like elementary school or middle school. My job is to prepare you actually for, you know, 2030 when you're at a college and working if you go to college and but when you're working. So really to prepare students from the time they hit elementary to be ready for 21st century jobs. Is that something? Can you tell us more about that and how many school districts you're working with and is where's the buy-in for programs like that? So maybe talking about two different things we maybe talking about learning part of K through 12 energy efficiency lessons. Okay, you talk about economic development certification. Okay, so the economic development certification is a program through the Department of Education under the CTE program. And we partner with them to work with school districts to earn this economic development certification. They have to apply. There's an application that they apply to and they go through about a nine month period of evaluation to ensure that their curriculum as well as the work that they're doing or in line with economic development as well as education and business industry. And you can find more about that on the CTE website, economic development certification center. That's great. And following that same logic, I think that you know kids when they're exposed to things at a young age, right? And this is not necessarily meant just to be about children, but you know Georgia Powell obviously a storied entity here for our state and literally does so much goodness and so many communities whether it be directly or indirectly through the EMCs. How does that work with you all getting into even the classrooms and that kind of that kind of kindergarten through fifth grade or middle school so they can get exposed to that? Do you have any programs like that? I'd say you said we're actually in pre-K. We're reading to pre-K students and as I talked about our learning power program, that's a program that we are in 155 but on 159 counties around the state of Georgia. We're teaching energy efficiency lessons to K-12 and we're talking about the different careers with Georgia power as well as in the energy industry as well. We also work with our CTE College of Career Academies to actually do summer internships for students. So we're only talking to them about the careers K-12 but once they get into 12 grade, we're talking a little bit more to them about the careers and we're bringing them to our facilities to what's called a day in a life. They actually tour the facility, look at the work we're doing and see if there's something interested in and then we follow that with an internship over the summer and we've had 21 people started last Monday. Fantastic. I've read too a lot of those groups as well. They're terrific. They're not that excited to hear from state senators to be honest with you but I bring my fire helmet and tell them I'm firemen, I'm usually a pretty big kid. Other questions from our committee members? Okay, seeing none, thank you so much for your presentation. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. All right, next up, Sharon Mason with our very own Cobb Chamber of Commerce, one of the counties I'm honored to represent. Take it away. Thank you Senator Albers for this invitation and to this entire study committee on this important work. It is great to be with you all as Senator mentioned. I'm honored to serve as the Cobb Chamber's president and CEO, working very closely with our Metro Chamber, Georgia Chamber and many Chambers across the state and here to talk a lot about the partnership initiatives, public private partnerships that should hopefully help us along the way with the study committee. I also want to mention Amanda Seals, our EVP of advocacy and government affairs is with me as well and I know many of you know her and working on many different things over the years. And for me personally, I've enjoyed Chamber industry now over 21 years because we get to work with so many partners in this room and outside of this room and each one of you are critical in this because workforce as we know there's many pieces to this puzzle and partnerships is at the heart of everything we're doing here. And so I want to talk a little bit about some of the successes because you mentioned some of the investments and workforce and we're really realizing and seeing those come to fruition in our local communities and it's great for you to know that those investments are really paying off and they're making a major difference. And so for us, I know you heard this from Metro Chamber and Georgia Chamber, number one issue we've heard from businesses, especially from our strategic planning process. We just got through hearing from over 500 stakeholders and the challenge of workforce came up not only loud and clear as the top challenge, but really five times greater than it did even five years ago. So that really shows you how things have changed. And I know for all of us, we're very proud as Senator Albers mentioned being number one state to do business, but it's important that we drive those innovative solutions to keep it that way. And for us and Cobb, the top reason companies are choosing Cobb choosing our state of Georgia is because of our talent and because of our pipeline. So initiatives like this, the study committee, even businesses knowing that we're driving solutions is going to make a major difference. And I know in our local communities will really be utilizing this as part of our talking points in this. And for us, I know many local chambers across the state and we get together, Dave's on our regional business coalition, we meet quarterly to share best practices. We started Cobb Workforce Partnership actually eight years ago and that was really to bring together K through 12 higher education and our target industries to really drive solutions so we could work together on a lot of things. And I know a lot of our local communities are doing the same thing. And so from that that helped us really be able to elevate some needed work and some of those things that we even started back eight years ago, we're seeing in Comder fruition. One of the first things out of the gate that we focused on was supporting the College and Career Academy development, especially advocating for the funding in different places and Commissioner Dozer. You know this so well and have been such a critical part of this. And so for us in Cobb County, we have two one College and Career Academy on Marietta campus, one Cobb Innovation Technology Academy in Cobb County Schools. Another one that just got approved for funding through our education spot, so we'll have a third coming up, but we already have two open that just opened up a few years ago. And we're already seeing the results of that. We're already seeing students not only increasing graduation rates, but really being able to find their talent, their passion and jobs available that they didn't realize, wow, this pays a lot. This is a great career for me. We hear that over and over from our great partners there and over and over from testimonials. That's a great example. And I think the more we can expand upon that, the better. Secondly, Vector Commissioner Dozer wanted to give you another shout out as well, because we just had this second Vector Center actually open in Marietta on Chattahooji Tech's campus. And this was something for us and our local community. And I want to give a shout out to Colonel Ross, who's now Commissioner Ross for our Veterans Affairs. She was phenomenal and she really showed us and won a Robins, the first Vector Center, how effective that model could be. I don't know, several of us, several business leaders. We went down and we visited her down in Warner Robins and saw how veterans, you could easily help transition into it. And if you're not familiar with that, veterans stands for Veterans Education, Career, Transition, Resource. That's exactly what is intended to do. And it really becomes a one-stop shop for veterans to help them transition in their careers and partnership with technical colleges. I know this would be a great model to have across the state, really having two that are going to be highly successful and then seeing Warner Robins doing so well. And the Vector Center really appreciate our state legislative delegation. We're able to get 2.25 million in funding approved to renovate an existing building on Chattahooji Tech's campus in Marietta. And that really dovetailed that support because we have hundreds of thousands of veterans in Northwest Georgia plus the technical college and just being a one-stop shop. And so excited to see more opportunities there. Also having Dobbins Air Reserve Base in our backyard. We've really been involved with the Georgia Joint Defense Commission. And that group has been driving legislation that helps more veterans transition in their careers. And I think the more that we can do that, the better. Making Georgia even more veteran friendly that is a group to really focus on. Next with our universities, and I know we've got some great folks at KSU and many other universities here represented. The support from the state for funding our universities and very specific projects as well as K through 12 is making a really big difference. And I know KSU, you're now almost 43,000 students there. And so having the new STEM building approved will make a major difference. And so that was a 34 million plus approval plus funding for the hope scholarship our teachers, all those things will make a very, very big impact. So thank you. But also we're seeing from our universities they are really listening to our businesses. And that's important. That's where the collaboration is coming and play. And so Cobbort Force Partnership, send them we've been trying to do is really be that resource for our universities to say, hey, this is coming down the line. This new degree program, this is really needed. And I did want to give KSU a shout out because this is, this is really incredible. So according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, new data science jobs, they're projected to increase 36% by 2031. I mean, that's tremendous. And so just this spring, KSU is approved by the Board of Regents to offer a bachelor of science and data analytics. And so that really gives them that full suite of degrees, bachelor's, master's, doctorate that will really help. And so in that fantastic job, I mean, the median salaries over 100,000, we know that's going to be great. So kudos to KSU. Thank you. And I think that's a great example of really collaboration listening. And then I'll also say industry specific legislation is making a really big difference. So Senate Bill 6, thank you, enabling more aerospace jobs and in particular, Lockheed to expand on our local community. And then, I mean, this whole, this whole legislative delegation, you all have supported so many great initiatives are incubators across the state, Georgia Tech, hatchbridge with KSU again has been great. Then the training programs, Georgia Quick Start, you mentioned this, Haley, thank you. Locally in Cobb, the workforce cobs power up, pre-apprentice program has been phenomenal and really making a big difference. So the more programs like that, I know we got a regional workforce board as well. And so all of those things really drive a lot of great things. We all also seen locally with a CARES Act funding and with ARPA funding. A lot of our local commissioners are using those for more workforce needs. I know particular for us in Cobb County in 2020, we were able to administer over 15 million and small business grants over 3700 companies just to help in that gap. And that was thanks to our Cobb Board of Commissioners. And then now through ARPA, we're administering day care grants because that's a very critical need. And so really each local community looking at those innovative solutions to drive is absolutely critical. You'll see in front of you, we did provide our annual report from Select Cobb, which is our economic development arm. And this gives some great resources about some very innovative programs. A lot of them are brand new. So one of them, you'll see real line restart. That's a partnership with Workshaws Cobb, Cobb Sheriff's Office, Chattahoochee Technical College Construction Ready. They just had their first set of graduates on 13 graduating from Construction Ready. And what it gave was inmates who were 90 days from being released. They were trained on the job. And so that way when they get out, they're able to get into the workforce really turn their life around and then make such a difference. And so you'll see that. And we've had a lot of other great programs that we're very proud of, be proud, you've to mend program. A lot of these things explained here, even driving some new solutions like HR Roundtable. But I will say something we heard from our workforce task force is that a lot of businesses don't know about all these resources and said the more education, more marketing about them, the better. That will make a big difference. And in closing, I just thank you again. Here is a resource here to help and here to answer questions. Thank you so much for everything that you're doing for Cobb County and also with the partners. And I think you brought something up that is particularly important, Sharon, which is making sure that our business community is working with our University of Technical College just in the connected dots. I always use the example that if you're getting a degree in Scandinavian art history, there's only one job when that person retires. We need to connect the dots to make sure that they are in fact doing that. You're representing your members and having everything from Commissioner Dozier and all of our Regent's Universities together helping the funnel that is really, really important. And certainly the Vector Center, if you have not got to see or learn about that, I encourage you to do that. Are there any specific things that you would like to see Sharon as an output from this committee that if you can just wave your magic wand and say this is the one thing that I want. I think the continued investment in our technical college system in our university system, universities, all those programs, they are major drivers for economic development and workforce development and they help in so many different ways that I mentioned several. And then also our K through 12 as we talked about, it starts at pre K really for the interest for these students and so the counselors, that was a great investment in the state session this year of investing in more counselors. So those type of initiatives and then other innovative solutions like the Vector. I know it's serving a great purpose in Northwest Georgia, the one in Warner Robins and serving a great purpose and really a great model in working with our technical colleges. And then other industry related work for solutions also will make a major difference too. That's great. Well, having Commissioner Dozier, but also Senator Hickman, chairs our Senate Higher Education Committee. So we've got the right people listening. Are there any questions from the committee members? Senator Estabez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Questions, slash comment, Sharon. Thank you so much for all that you and the cocktail were doing. I appreciate the fact that you all focused on partnerships and as the chairman mentioned having that K 12 higher education, business partnership is extremely important. And I've seen having been on the school board how effective it is to have that partnership at each level and reach for students as the senator Hickman said, 10th grade, earlier and giving them information. You mentioned that your members often don't have the information about all the resources available. Students also don't necessarily have that information available. Or they may be interested in a career or an apprenticeship or an internship. They may not know how to get there. So one question that I had is related and you touched on this, the importance of counselors, the importance of people at the school level who can provide students with specific information because really what we need to be doing, and you see examples of this and your information is handing a road map to these individuals. And when you hand them the road map, they're able to follow it and complete it. Yeah, absolutely, Senator. You hit the nail on the head. That is so true. And students is important. A lot of them don't realize that there are all these great careers out there that would match their passion, their ability, and great paying jobs. And more heavily available than other career paths that might not lead to as great of a job as a sound might. And so that is a great opportunity with the counselors to really guide them and help match what their interest level is, what their passion is, where they're going to excel. That's critically important. And that's also where the college and career academies do play such a vital role because you really hands on, get to experience different things and realize things you may not be good at or things that might be right up your alley that are perfect for you and where you're going to be interested. And also lead internships because sometimes students need to try out things to see what is the best pathway for them. And so all of those play a critical role. The parent education, the student education, the overall business education as well. And making sure we're matching up all to move forward for our workforce pipeline. Thank you. Can I ask a couple questions? Absolutely. Well, one of the things you hit on it, I have not paid a lot of attention to this until lately, but I'm having more and more people you hit on earlier about daycare. And the cost of daycare being so high, I'm sure you got a lot of young parents in this room. I don't know what it is, but they tell me it's settled could be several hundred dollars a week time. And so what we're having is, is that right? Wow. So we've got a real issue there because we got we got parents that can't afford that. So the moms have made it. And so I think it's the kind of it's kind of like a. I don't know see saw thing because the mother the mother the mother stopped working. So maybe she's at home now working with a children reading to them at night helping read. But yet on the other hand, parents can't afford to send them to some daycare. So there's some issues there. We got a balance out. The other thing that this is kind of a paid political, no paid, paid announcement here. We will kick off our literacy council, which is creating an educated workforce sometime in August. And one of those key issues that we're going to be looking at in that is pre K and K through 12. Because what we're finding out and I'll give you all an example is that in Canterbury County, which is one of the counties I represent, when I talked to bubble longer and superintendent in that county, I said, have me kids in Canterbury County qualify for pre K. He said 140. I said, have me to you having school. He said 110. I said, where the other 30 children that he said they're at home. I said, why are they at home? He said two reason he said the parents have to elect for me to go to pre K. It's not a mandatory situation. And the other thing is we don't have any other pre K authorized daycares or church there. So you got you got 30 kids in that in that county. Every year that is already one year behind kids that go to pre K. Then the other thing you got to we got to look at is and we dropped a bill on this and waiting on the fiscal note is the mandatory age for children to go to kindergarten. The school is six to 16. So my birthday is in September. School starts in August. My parents don't have to send me to school until next year. So Jason's already two years ahead of me in school. So when we get to third grade and they start doing these tests on us, I literally raised my literacy race way behind his. So all of a sudden I can't psychological deal with it. He's so far ahead. He said there's issues like this and all this stuff is so timely with what we're talking about here today and then also the pre and educated work. You're absolutely right. And yes, pre K is critical and that feeds into success later in life. I know you'll see many.

studies behind that and then also the daycare that we've heard that that's a major issue for a lot of families trying to get back to the workforce and so we really appreciate Cobbord, a commissioners allowing us to and partnering with us to administer grants for daycares through select COD and that should help and help specifically with the local COP community but I know a lot of local communities are looking at best ways to utilize those funds to help in needs like that. Yeah absolutely. Any other questions? Sharon, I was so glad that you mentioned so many businesses that are taking proactive steps to really engage with their K-12 systems and their higher education systems. I think what Senator Estivis shared about really helping students build that roadmap is so critical and then what Senator Halpun was talking about kind of building these economic development strategies around those partnerships but you know I think certainly the opportunity is really to do this at scale you know not to kind of just do one company here and one school here so I would love your thoughts just on kind of building kind of a more cohesive strategy at the local level and in state level as well. Yeah I think there's a lot of opportunities to expand upon some of these great successes we've had in many communities and especially focus on on specific emerging industries like logistics supply chain that we've seen growing on a hospitality tourism in a major industry there's there's many others of looking at industry specific as well. Other questions from the community members? Alright see you know thank you Senator thank you. Next we're going to have UPS Steven Jones if you want to make your way up here and first I want to just mention that we have Mr. Nick Smith here which is no stranger to us he was a tremendous asset to our state and you're fortunate to have him and I do also want to just mention a quick story Oz Nelson the former chairman and CEO of UPS was a good personal friend of mine as well as a fraternity brother and we got to speak in the same stage and many times together and I remember meeting with Oz and asking him he made the decision to move UPS from northeast down to Atlanta many years ago and I asked him what was the single you know overriding decision to make such a big move such as a story company like UPS of Georgia and he said you know that the answer was actually pretty simple John he said it wasn't that we had every answer in Georgia but we had the grit and determination to figure out what the answer would be to all those questions so tremendous man and mentor to me personally and thank you for representing UPS and talking to us today. Well thank you for the opportunity my name is Steve Jones and I'm the director of HR planning for UPS and I'm very passionate about workforce development been involved in workforce development for 22 years had the privilege and honor to serve on the United States Secretary of Labor's advisory committee on apprenticeship for 10 years and help with the apprenticeship programs in the country as well but when you think about UPS in general people think about the brown trucks and what I say is that we hire everything from people who unload trailers in the middle of the night to pharmacists to nurses to automobile mechanics anything that you can think of we hire we have about 530,000 employees globally and when you think about 530,000 employees what does it take to staff an organization our size it's it's a big effort so just a little bit about background we're seeing that job growth is still robust and most industries are back to pre pandemic levels of employment I would encourage the committee to actually look at the conference boards reports on labor for the next 10 years because labor shortages are here to stay we are not going to have enough employees in the United States or in Georgia to fill every single job opening and so we're going to have to do some things differently within the country particularly for industries like UPS or the restaurant industries which require in-person service workers we are seeing that the signs of the current labor shortage are past us to the worst extent we're starting to see that come better wage growth is strong particularly blue collar wage growth is stronger than white collar wage growth at this time and we're going to continue to see that trend here in Georgia and elsewhere because we do not produce enough blue collar workers in the United States our education systems are designed to get everybody to be college ready versus career ready and I would encourage the committee to look at career ready employment as well as college ready education systems so as we look at our economy over the next few few months we think job growth will continue to slow going into the second half of the year we expect the number of job openings to decline and we expect the unemployment rate to grow in the United States about 4.5% by the end of the year as I said any recession that we do go into is only going to ease recruitment retention difficulties for a temporary time period labor shortages are here at least until 2030 and I'm seeing as far out as till 2040 and we're going to continue to face those suppressors that requires companies like UPS to change our employee value proposition to change how we go to market to be more adaptable it also requires us to provide career development opportunities for our own employees so one of the things that we do that's unique is even for our part-time employees every part-time employee here in the state of Georgia has the ability to use our earn-and-learn program which we will pay $5,250 a year of college tuition for them as long as they're employed with UPS we think that's a great differentiator of ours but we need to learn how in in the current labor markets how to do some things differently and jobs skills are going to change and so one of the other things that I would encourage the committee to look at is capabilities and job skills because the world changes so rapidly that even with an MBA 10 years down the road the skills that you learn are probably outdated so if people don't learn and companies don't require people to continue to develop skills and capabilities if we don't encourage that and we don't have tax policies that encourage that people become their jobs go away and so I would I would really urge you to look at capabilities and skills the other thing that I would talk a little bit about is we have to look at labor differently and we have to look at it as a talent pool versus a labor pool and a talent pool allows us to identify skills that then can become capabilities and we as companies need to be able to provide training opportunities to build a necessary expertise earlier we mentioned that in the state of Georgia that we asked for 10 years for things for three years there are many jobs that are that way and across a lot of industries because we haven't as industry and as government and as policymakers started to make this shift to capabilities and capabilities is where it's going to go it'll be interesting to see how that ends up in the next 10 years I wanted to just talk about some skills at UPS that we need right now in my previous role I was responsible for U.S. talent acquisition and marketing and branding we in the United States if you can tell me where to go find mechanics both automotive, electrical, truck, diesel, conveyor, plant, aircraft, anything if you can tell me where to go find them on a regular basis I'd like to know about it we don't create them in the United States we don't incent people to go into it the barrier entry to be a mechanic is tools and so there's programs that could be created that people could get grants to get their first set of tools the $5,000 this required to get their first job mechanics pay between 70 and $140,000 a year I think that's a pretty good job maybe we should look into that the other thing that we don't have enough of in the country is drivers with CDLs we have a well over 100,000 driver shortage right now we don't have the ability to create programs to train them quick enough to be able to make a difference if anybody who's lived through the supply chain issues that we've had in the past couple years understands is that a CDL driver is critical to the economy some of the other things that we look at that are really critical for us as a company is people who can problem solve people who can have computer skills basic math skills multi-tasking abilities accountability for decision making those are some of the skills that we need we need people who can collaborate build customer relationship skills when we talk about these types of things we don't teach many of these in our school systems we teach things that are really important but how are they going to get the life skills that are required to be able to be employment ready is something I believe that many needs to look at from our professional standpoint like I said we have a lot of professionals about 50,000 of us that are professionals at UPS digital fluency is going to be a critical skill moving forward data analytics just like auto mechanics I'll find any engineer please send them my way we can use them anybody that has stem skills are really really hard to come by and we don't create enough of them in our country to be competitive IT all disciplines how are you going to train IT differently how about boot camps what can we look at to get this current skills that we need today agility how to how to be agile we we find that people have a difficult time the world changes so dramatically so quickly that we cannot change as quick as we think we should so those are some of the skills that we think at UPS that are going to be critical for the community to look at and with that I'm happy to take any questions that you have Steve thanks for that great presentation you highlighted something that I agree and I think this is something I'm looking over at Haley right now we'll start adding to our report is the you know I think we made a shift a generation or so ago to every kid going into school we should get on a college path and again we always want to support education in all forms however in in lieu of doing that we took out of some of the shop classes and auto mechanic classes and other things that were were traditionally in in the high school environment and I'm not sure if you've ever studied some of the model they have over in Europe specifically Germany where they work on different career tracks are you familiar with any of those type of things that are being done other areas of the world I am if you want to look at how they really do it Germany it's through the apprenticeship program and I would also encourage the committee to look at the South Carolina's version of apprenticeship they have some really great things in the apprenticeship working with their technical colleges that has made South Carolina the leader of apprenticeships in the United States so I would encourage you to look at that as well that's great hit we would see if we can't get some information on that to send to the committee members that would be great well one of the question that I have in relation to workforce right now I met with a group of people a few weeks ago Steve and all kind of in there they're early to mid 60s or even late 60s who retired during the pandemic you know it was one of those times where life seemed to be too short the stock market had gone through the roof there was a lot of good reasons to retire and they did and they took so security early now though they're face with the stock market has been a little bit of an up and down a little more down than up certainly inflation pressures have been there as well and some of those folks both need and want to go to work however they're penalized to go back to work for that time and I'm wondering because the baby boomer generation is by far our most you know skilled and reliable generation in the workforce right now what would your thoughts be if we could find a way you know to hopefully take the penalty away for a certain amount of time or if not permanently to get some of those experience revered back so that's a that's a federal question that I wish I had to answer for Senator the penalties on a lot of things even for people who are disabled that get some social security benefits make it so that people don't have the ability to have part time employment I would think that there was some ways that we could work with the federal government to incentive people to continue to work I asked that knowing your department of labor background so I thought maybe we could have a further discussion if I can help I'd love to okay questions from the committee members for Steve more of a comment thank you Stephen I would say that list of skills that you have if you were to transfer that to Delta Airlines it would play perfectly not a mere what a lot of other folks are talking about don't actually removing college degrees off of the job descriptions in a lot of areas focusing on the skills first approach and so what I would encourage us committee to consider is the Atlanta R the College and Career Academy model overall that model of getting to the kids before they graduate to let them know they're better options so they know what they're signing up for they've already had they already have the competency they get a chance to try it in a very low risk fashion it creates just an environment where our graduation rates go up our cost per student goes down because more people come prepared and so I would I would hope that we would focus on that and part of that is to get the right information to our high school counselors our high school counselors are products of the education system so they believe the education is the way to get out of poverty and elsewhere but there are many other ways that people can do that so part of it is also to make sure that our high school counselors are equipped with the right information so people can make the right choices yeah I would agree the salary ranges you mentioned were very accurate well north of six figures in a very in just a few years right so good jobs minus sort of an open ended question something I'd also like to make sure that the committee keep is focused on which is that we've heard a lot of very hard technical skills that are needed in the workforce and certainly there are no end of those but I think it's also you mentioned things like accountability and collaboration and communication skills which I would call more kind of soft skills maturity skills as opposed to professional skills so I want to make sure that in our conversations we keep a laser focus on those as well I mean punctuality is a skill and in my world I'm sure as well as as well as Delta you know we find that some of our we have the privilege of being some workers first jobs and the job falls to us then to teach them being on time is important you know reading the uniform manuals important and I think those things are just as relevant in today's labor market I agree with you and and we don't do a really good job of teaching those skills in our education system as well so that's something that we could look at just how to handshake a good solid handshake I think I've got to put someone in the eyes those type of skills yes I just want to add something to the apprenticeship and love your comments around apprenticeship and South Carolina model I do want to thank the governor of the Senate and the House for a first time supporting two years ago a base funding for apprenticeships and then this last year the governor through the cares funding provided an additional four million dollars toward apprenticeships so very very proud of where we're moving on apprenticeships and hopefully hopefully we'll be standing there talking about Georgia pretty soon on apprenticeships but we have a great foundation because of many folks like the chairman here so thank you and may I just make a point on that if you want to have the best paying career in the United States right now without a college education you need to be an advanced manufacturing machinist and if we don't figure out in Georgia how to produce those we are not going to be successful to continue to have the types of economic growth that we have because as jobs continue to be matured we may not have as many jobs in plants but these machinists are absolutely critical to the success of Georgia. Just a question everything you said in your presentation totally resonates with me one I want to say thank you for even in the beginning explaining all the different kinds of jobs at UPS because I think one of the challenges in our conversations often we're talking kind of really entry level or really advanced level and there's this whole middle section of workers who also need new opportunities so that they can continue to build their careers as well so thank you for that reminder I'm thinking about my dad who worked at IBM for 30 plus years and obviously we're no longer this is generational you know kind of in that mindset so much but because you mentioned the work that UPS is doing with kind of helping employees either upskill or re-skill I'm wondering just from a business standpoint how much tension are you feeling in terms of how quickly people are generally and you might not have this problem at UPS or Delta but how quickly people are willing to leave your company for the next company as opposed to really staying and then seeing their career with a growing trajectory all the way through to the end. Thanks for the question Senator and thanks for your support as well understand that's in your district so thank you I'm a product of starting at UPS as an unloader in the middle of the night going to college so I've been there 33 years so I grew up with the company into a pretty senior role it's interesting how if you can't sell what an opportunity is as a company what's the next step how many people are willing to jump for 10 cents five cents an hour we all have to do a better job of having people understand what it can be all right so we have some really great paying jobs at UPS our drivers are paid very well as many of you know and it's a matter of teaching them and talking to them about those opportunities and we try to at UPS we try to have five five out of six of our promotions within the company that's just something we try to do we think it's easier to grow talent than to buy talent and I think it's just a philosophy that a company has to have if that's what they want to do. I just wanted to double click on something that the chairman pointed out which is the pendulum swinging in our education system from sort of gatekeeping and folks not being able to go to college as freely as they could to the pendulum swinging all the way to everyone should go to college and if you don't go to college then you're a failure and I think that stigma has stuck around us and is it's in our schools and I'm curious whether commissioner dozier agrees with this but our technical college system is a valuable piece of this puzzle and too often if a student says I'm going to a technical college after high school graduation they don't get celebrated as much by the community and not just their parents but just generally celebrated as much as they would if they were saying I'm going to Georgia State or UGA and I think one of the things we need to talk about is how we change not only public policy but the culture in the state around that pathway of going through technical college or going straight into UPS and upgrading your skills. I'll let the commissioner answer that. So I do see TCSG as value. Yeah you mentioned that but absolutely I think we are the pendulum is moving. I made a comment to someone the other day we've done a great job in Georgia of showing certain pathways as being true viable pathways for great career earnings and future meaning welding. We have families across this state who see welding as a true pathway for future success. We have not navigated as many pathways as we need to for that success building on what you you mentioned and that's something we're working hard at TCSG to do is to truly educate and see those pathways so that the opportunities both financially and career are seen because I think that is so so important. The other thing is is we continue to work extremely hard to make sure that our identity is understood because as the good overview provided the identity of TCSG is very difficult sometimes to understand we provide an opportunity for our adult learners. We provide an opportunity for those looking for a technical skill and we offer opportunities for someone who's just trying to get their kickstart to a four-year degree. We issued over 9,000 associate degrees last year and so as you look at the opportunity of your 22 colleges across the state it truly is the pathway to any pathway that you may want in your future career and so I truly appreciate the comment because there are so many opportunities for true careers that's offered at TCSG and USG but we don't truly promote it and celebrate it as the org you use and that's something we're really working on so thank you appreciate that. Any other questions for Steve? Just one other comment this year we have I think seven valid Victorians that chose TCSG as their pathway so I think that says a little bit also. That really does and my my data is going to be a few years old but when I sit down and talk to kids which most of us get to do and center-estive as you're spot on I remind them this was a few years old a few years ago that seven of the top ten most wealthiest people in the planet did not have a college degree if you measure that as your your point of success it's something to keep in mind probably why I'm not doing nearly as well. Steve just a funny just kind of a funny question I know when y'all first came to statesboro UPS moved to statesboro y'all was wife to trucks every night you don't watch the trucks every night anymore what what happened to that you know you know Senator I don't know the answer to that. Labor shortage. All right Steve thank you so much for everything you do your presentation in UPS thank you Nick. Okay next we're gonna get some tag teaming from the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association we're gonna have Mark Friday and Raymond Reyes come on up and I want to thank Chris Hartman who's I think going to kick us off here who should be no stranger to all of us in the capital as well and aside from being great representative for the association has the unfortunate problem of being one of my neighbors. I'm a lucky man I'm sure you're gonna pass me on the way home today so well thank you Mr. Chairman as the chairman mentioned my name is Chris Hartman I serve as the director of governmental affairs for the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association I want to start off by thanking this committee for their dedication and your time to spend tackling probably the most critical issue that our industry has faced in many many years and we will continue to face for those of you that don't know I think Miss Williams actually told you earlier today that the hospitality and tourism industry is the state's second largest private sector employer generating roughly $65 billion and total economic impact. For her 20,000 jobs that was going to be my next statement so the hotels which make up a large portion of that industry actually support over 300,000 jobs which equates to roughly $22 billion in wages and salaries each year but that number is down just over 10% from 2019 and in order for our industry to be able to grow and to get back to those 2019 numbers we need the support of this committee and our innovative efforts to be able to bring us back. I like to say that the greatest asset in a hotel it's not the structure it's not the amenities you receive for the atmosphere that you have it's those men and women that work tirelessly each and every day to provide that memorable experience for the over 150 million visitors that come to our state each and every year and nobody knows that better than the two gentlemen that I have here today with me. We have Mr. Mark Friday that took just about as long as of a trip as the chairman Hickman did coming from Savannah to join you today he's with the planners in Savannah and then following him will be Ramon Reyes who is just down the street at the Omnits CNN Center and actually recently wrote a book about Senator Estavez and Senator Halford and you guys mentioned about the pathway in a career he just wrote a book about his pathway in his career and hospitality and how he got to where he is today so they'll be able to take two very unique perspectives though they have different properties and different parts of the state they have similar struggles when it comes to the workforce crisis that we're in right now so with that Mr. Chairman if you'll allow I'd like to bring Mark Friday up. Welcome Mark and thank you for coming up and while you're doing that Chris thank you for the introduction and overview and I know as we continue our committee meetings we're going to rely more for more regionally located folks as well from GHLA. Senator Halford thank you and the committee for doing this this has truly been I've been in the business 45 years and this has always been something that needs to be addressed. Senator Hickman if you need a ride home let me know and I'll let me just briefly go over I was told to give you a little background on myself as I've said I've been in the business for about 45 years actually came up through the pathway of washing dishes and there's many a day I wish I could go back to doing that I worked at larger hotels the hotel I'm at right now the planters in the small boutique hotel in Savannah has 60 rooms and I've worked in hotels up to 230 rooms so it's I've got a very very opinion of how some of those work I had a lot of mentors growing up and I think that's one of the things that that our industry is missing right now I had Leroy Dukes when I worked in Athens go dogs and Mr. Doug Lambert from Savannah and I'm thankful for them for all they taught me the workforce that that we have in the workforce that we need within our industry is just so important I've given you I gave the committee a spreadsheet that was produced by the American Hotel and Lodge Association now on that is is the national figures on the right hand side which they published but more importantly was was the Georgia district too was what they call it and that encompasses the majority of the

area. And if you look at that, it'll, it breaks down the, the gas spending, the number of properties, number of guest rooms and what have you can look at that as your leisure. I'm not going to go through it. But I gave that to you for the interpretation that we need to understand how much of a workforce that we need. We have it, we have in that entire district the hotels and on the average they require 135 employees to operate each day. And it's now some are smaller and some are larger at an average, but it's very difficult to find that many people and that many qualified people to come in there and do what we need to do. Our industry, and we, you know, you talked about apprenticeship and I've always thought that our industry is one of the last apprenticeships there are because the people that come in, we teach them, you know, how to do specific skills, but more importantly, I think from, from a workforce development standpoint and I think the restaurant tour at the end of mentioned this, we need soft skills. We need people to know how to say yes or in no sir and come in on time and what to wear and stay at work when you're there. The soft skills that, well don't laugh, you know what I'm talking about. The soft skills that, that, that when we grew up, we had that background and I think that goes a long way. A lot of the larger corporate hotels, they have their own and house training programs to do what they need to, but it's just, our business is trying to make guests happy and in order to make the guests happy, we have to have the employees happy and we have to have them trained and how to make other people happy. And that seems to be a challenge. I'm not sure why, but I mean it is. And a lot of that can start within the school system. I mean it, it's great for our industry, but I see it actually going into all the industries that we've talked about so far. I mean it's not just a one shot deal. Let's see if there's, in Savannah we have the Big Hyundai plant that's there and we have, I think it's called that quick start program down there where the economic development comes in and they set up their trailer and they teach them how to do what they need to do. You know it would be nice if there was something or some way that either the technical colleges or the state could put something like that together to teach the soft skills that we need. There's also probably an online component you could do to that, but it's to me and I tell my employees this is such a simple business. You just have to make the people happy, but it's the most difficult thing in the world to do. It's just, it's frustrating at times. Now of course, you know, I'm, I'm pleased say I'm old and I need to retire because that's not the way things are and I'm like well that's the way things should be and we will not. I mean there's a lot of other businesses that will be able to do a lot of automation to take care of some of the vacancies that there exists, but we can't do that. We are face to face and we're people to people and I think that's what they expect. I appreciate Governor Kent for doing what he did in opening the state as quickly as he did. I think without that the industry it took one heck of a hit, but I think it was minimized by the actions that he took and the fourth right thought process that he had into that. So we as a hospitality industry are very thankful for that. I'm especially thankful because some of the buffets are starting to come back. In Savannah itself and just from a local perspective, I mean the hotels that we have down there now and it's interesting because the more hotels that we have the fewer hotel, the fewer employees some of the other hotels have, I'm not quite sure how that works, but so we've got about seven new hotels that are in the pipeline right now averaging about a hundred rooms a piece. So they'll be looking for employees probably the same ones we have. The industry down in Savannah, the hotel motel tax just in the Savannah area is expected to bring in $47 million next year. I mean we to say we have a robust economy tourism economy down there is an understatement. And I say that just to show to you how important it is for us as hoteliers, but also for the local industry and then also for the state from a revenue standpoint. I know that at the time of Ireland the majority of the hotel motel tax makes up about 50% of their budget. So it's very important for them. It's very important for the city of Savannah where we're fortunate to have an increase. I say fortunate we were had an increase in the hotel motel tax up to about 8% this special legislative session and with that what we're going to do is improve River Street, improve the city market area, improve some of the rotten street area and that just brings more people in. So I thank you thank you all for for doing that. And let me just close by saying it's you know I'll get back to the workforce and it's just so important that we get some of the people with the soft skills that want to be a part of the industry and it can make it up there. I mean you can stay in the industry for years and move all around and it's a great great industry. With that I'll turn it over to my colleague and author. Thank you Mark. Appreciate it. I'm welcome. And thank you to all the committee members as well for having us and a lot of us an opportunity to share our thoughts and I was asked to also share a little bit about my career but I'll double down on some of the very points that were made today with regards to the importance of education. So I'm going to go a little further back. I'm a byproduct of a program of the National Academy Foundation. So my career in hospitality started in my high school years where I learned the very soft skills that you mentioned. I learned how to write my resume. I learned about a firm handshake. I learned about travel and tourism but above and beyond that I learned how important it would be to serve people and how to best execute that and all of that started in high school. And so I believe that that's where it starts. So fast forward a little bit after that I began my career as a dormant and had the good fortune of working in every single position within the hotel and that apprenticeship that was discussed. That that journey for me was in one building in the city of New Orleans for ten years where I had the good fortunes I mentioned of working every single position before going into management. The mentorship along the way, the learnings along the way. All of that was started during those foundational years in high schools as well. And so I believe in education I think that's part needs to be part of our solution as well start early on and start exposing people to our industry. Most people that work in our industry, their degrees are in everything but hospitality. But most of them fell into our industry and fell in love with it subsequently because similar to UPS we have almost every single position that you can think of. We have sales and marketing. We have engineering. We have anything culinary as well. Anything where that basically fulfills your passion and your purpose. And today you hear the term used of often meaningful work. That's what that apprenticeship allows you to do is find what job and what purpose you have and what's meaningful to you. And so I think again starts in the high school years and moves fast forward. I have the good fortune today to serve as the general manager of the Omni Atlanta Hotel here in downtown. Prior to that I opened the Omni at the Battery and partnership with the Braves there. And our challenges post pandemic certainly because that was pre pandemic now post pandemic have changed. I have a hotel the pre pandemic used to have 600 associates working in order to fulfill the needs of our customers. Today we're just under 400 associates with business that's back to levels where I should have 600 people. And the way I've supplemented that is with H2Bs with J1s and with contract labor. All of which we would prefer not to have I would prefer to have associates who work directly for the hotel that are that are a byproduct of programs here in the state of Georgia. And how we fix that again I think is is with focusing on those early years in education exposing those students to career and hospitality. I am still working with the National Academy Foundation where I mentor high school and college students. But we don't have any programs that with the National Academy Foundation actually are focused on travel and tourism. And I think that's what we need to focus on. I think all the other points have been made and we've kind of gone pretty lengthy with our time. But those are my comments and I think everyone for having us today. That was a great comments. Thank you. What's the name of your book or a phone? Familia. Familia is a charismatic framework to hospitality to growth and hospitality. That's fantastic. And I just want to follow up on what you said Mark said and certainly what Ryan said on those soft skills. I think some of that school I think a lot of that's parents though. Right. And you know that's what you know I was taught and what I've taught my boys to do. And in today's day and age I think these are prohibitor. Right. Too much time not actually communicating face to face and just texting or using social media. So I think in part of that maybe the answer is and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this is schools also have to educate parents sometimes on what they need to be doing at home and to help that gap. And I think that maybe sending stuff home saying are you mean with your kids and talking about these soft skills and talking about these things away to communicate because it's only so much we can expect a school to do because you know a teacher can't be everything to a child right they actually have to just be able to teach too. So what are your thoughts? I agree probably one of the toughest things to do though is to tell parents how to parent but but I've actually I do some work in the nonprofit space as well we focus on youth and career development and in my prior life in New Orleans and we actually did spend time with the parents and the students and focus on that very subject hence why I say it's it's quite difficult but I certainly agree with the importance. All right. Question from Senator Halper. Hi I'm wondering so my my family's in the hospitality industry as well we're restaurants not hotels my husband started at like 16 chopping vegetables at a Chinese restaurant fell in love with it got like well went no dish washing they got promoted to chopping vegetables and then anyway fell in love with it went to school and he's been in his whole life I'm wondering this question I'm wondering if you are finding a generational difference in people's love for this industry driven by the fact in the Georgia Chamber I learned this just recently that so like the largest percentage you can tell me the percentage I forget 80 I'm making this up 85% but it's a predominant number of kids graduate from high school now having never worked a job at all and in the hospitality industry it strikes me that this is what you know like I worked in a restaurant when I was in high school like this is where you would find the love for it so I'm wondering if you if you think if there's a generational peace also to this particular industry yeah where did people generally fall in love with the industry to decide that they were gonna make it a career was it before they graduated was it after whatever they were doing that well I think certainly probably different for everyone but I can share from my personal experience in high school I grew a love for travel and tourism but today what we're seeing is you know applicant flow has increased it's gotten better over the last couple of years but those people don't necessarily have an idea of what a career in hospitality looks like or feels like and that kind of lends to the to the turnover for us in particular again I can always speak for my hotel there there was two years ago our turn our retention rate was 24.4% so we weren't retaining anyone because they would come in try it and they would they would basically leave because they didn't know what hospitality was about the work wasn't meaningful to them fast forward we're around 74% today so it's gotten better but I do think that you have to have an opportunity to really be exposed to the industry and learn Creasore has a fantastic program where we have four interns from Creasore at our hotel and I think a great model for most any high schools to have to expose these kids to a career in hospitality and even if they don't want to go in hospitality to expose them to a place of business what it means to again give a firm handshake and to look someone in the eye and understand how a place of business works I think we need more programs like that. Ramon thank you so much I appreciate you I appreciate Chris up I don't know more question mark I know back during the pandemic I know Doug Lambert used some prison labor as house keeping is that all that over with now is that just it was that just a bad during that time that happened or he's available now. All right well again thank you thank Chris and Mark and Mark I want to follow up one comment you said about customer service and I would just say that all the businesses I've ever had or worked that I've told people the only sustainable advantage of business is superior customer service your spot on my friend thank you. Okay and now last but certainly not least I want to bring up Jasmine and Brett with select filter right here in the heart of Fulton County and they're doing some great stuff on workforce and we'll look forward to hearing from them we're gonna try and keep on track and wrap up here in the next 15 minutes so I'll turn it over to you. Thank you Mr. Chairman I can tell you're your wisdom and that not only did you stack the committee with Fulton representative is but you put us at the end so the last thing everyone can hear as you get back into traffic is how great Fulton County is and Senator Heckman we welcome you's an honorary member of the Fulton delegation and join us. My name is Brett Lacey I'm the deputy director for Select Fulton where the economic and workforce development arm of Fulton County serving our employers and the residents of Fulton County to ensure that they are competing for the workforce and opportunities here in Fulton County and to compete for these jobs of the 21st century. Gonna be a little bit of relief pitching here for Haley. As the deputy director in Select Fulton I oversee our workforce team which means that we are in charge of Fulton's local workforce development board there are 19 boards across the state and we administer the state's workforce innovation opportunity act funding that flows down from the technical college system of Georgia. So I've got the map up there to orient you again there's 19 of us across the state doing this work so anything I talk about as it pertains to WIOA you can get at your home home county anywhere in Georgia. Last year our system our public workforce system that's funded with these federal workforce dollars served over a hundred thousand job seekers. It's pre-remarkable that's about just over half of all individuals that claimed unemployment over that time period so you're talking 150,000 individuals on unemployment we served over a hundred thousand in some form or fashion whether that's enrolling in training or coming to see us for employment skills job readiness skills doing labor market research to find out about these jobs they came into our career centers and we were able to offer those services to them. The top training programs that we actually enroll them into and support that training whether it's at the technical college system or another training provider in the state and we saw that lineup right with where you're going to see those top jobs in the state of healthcare IT and logistics. I'd add as a person on that that Fulton County recently made it a half million dollar investment in Atlanta technical college to build out a new truck driving facility for Atlanta Tech so they had more opportunity and more space to train truck drivers as we're kind of maxing that out and cannot get enough students into seats to actually get their CDL that's part of the problem. The final note that I'll put on this slide is that it costs us just over 5,800 dollars per individual to go through our programs. We're spending just under $6,000 to take an individual who might be unemployed whether that's an adult or a youth and get them back into a high demand career where they are earning on average about $38,000 so $6,000 investment by these federal funds turns into $38,000 in wages and you can think about how that turns over in the local community directly and directly what we're able to do and the impact we can make on families just on that $6,000. It's not to say it's all roses and sunshine. We do have some issues there that we're trying to tackle to just do more and continue to provide the workforce that our employers need. There are several areas that we see as kind of untapped where we've not really made headway into the workforce. The first being the long-term unemployed so these are going to be individuals that have exhausted their unemployment benefits and are no longer in that count of 150,000 individuals who filed with the State Department of Labor. They may have exhausted them or just given up looking for work and we're trying to get them back into the workforce. Another major barrier that we're trying to get into is individuals who have a criminal background. Again, thank you all for SB 157 which you all unanimously passed through the Senate last year. Got a little hung up in the house on occupational licensing reform. Two individuals that have a criminal background. Sometimes this was preventing them from getting their license and going into a workforce opportunity. We're looking to streamline those that the limits that are in place make sense for those occupational boards. I'll also note the particular here in the Atlanta area there is the potential for refugee population similar to senior citizens of individuals that have skills, have a lot of experience, but for one reason or another are not entering into the workforce. Some of it may be a credential issue, but again that's something that I think we could take a look at is how to rapidly credential in they may have education or licenses from their home country and being able to get them into the workforce here in Georgia. Then we see the limits that are on full participation in the workforce. Again, those that may be not filing for unemployment may not be acting, actually seeking jobs, what those reasons are. The top three reasons that we hear from our job seekers are coming to our center that they are not able to complete training or go into the workforce or child care, transportation and housing. I grouped those three here for you. There are some strategies that are in place or some winning programs that can do that. In particular I'd encourage the committee to look at the state of Mississippi and the Dallas-4th area which takes $10 that are already coming into the state and they leverage those dollars to cover the cost of child care for individuals, low-income individuals who are in training or some sort of a work experience program. So they're already doing that sort of work requirement of trying to get back into the workforce, but a lot of times that cost of child care, the pay check wipes out that check. And so these are funds that the state already has, Georgia does not really leverage this as much as we could, but using those $10 to cover the cost of child care for those eligible individuals could help remove that barrier so they can get back into the workforce. We also noted we've already sort of talked about the skills mismatch, Jamal talked about it, how some of the job openings don't match the population that we have and the credentials and skills that they have. I'd also add to that there are barriers such as high-speed internet access. We have really seen since the pandemic a number of jobs have moved remote or virtual and sometimes individuals aren't able to even take advantage of those jobs because they don't have reliable internet at home to be able to log in every day and complete the job. So it's one thing that we're continuing to make investments in and look at how do we make sure that every citizen in Georgia has that high-speed internet access. And then the big thing what I've got this nice little line graph on the screen for is something that's called benefit cliffs and this is a big conversation for us as workforce development professionals. This is a chart that's produced by the Federal Reserve Bank here in Atlanta. There are tremendous resource force from a policy perspective, but what you see and what this line illustrates is as an individual increases their earnings it's going to reflect the public assistance they might be on that's attached to that income. So what ends up happening is that they cross a threshold for which their actual take home pay drops significantly. There are some programs where it's a long tail things like the earned income tax credit. It's a long tail to get them off of that assistance and being able to adjust their budget. There are other programs where as soon as you earn one dollar more you lose the entire benefit. And it changes your household earnings where you were able to afford your grocery bill, able to afford gas in your car and completely wipes it out. And you see that major drop there at about fifty five thousand dollars. That's where we see that wipe out. So you have workers we've talked to employers, we've talked to job seekers who will turn down job opportunities. They turn down promotions because they know with that new job and with that increased in earnings they're going to be worse off. So it's just a policy piece that we can look at and try to look at what levers the state can pull to turn that into a long tail rather than a cliff and encourage individuals to pursue those additional jobs. Again that's a barrier where particularly for some of these jobs that are earning seventy eighty thousand dollars. Part of the reason we can't find a workforce is because individuals are actively not seeking jobs that earn over certain income. Right. So again they know exactly where that that dollar changes and where they're take home resources really change. So those are some of the things from a policy piece that we're looking at. I do want to highlight some some great things that we do have in Fulton and some of these touch on some things that we've talked about this afternoon. The first is we call max. It's the Metro Atlanta Exchange for Workforce Solutions. So this is really a collaborative of your educational providers, your industry leaders, your workforce development organizations here in the Metro area and it is a database basically of where we go one we go all. So if you are an employer, if you are a some sort of a provider of resources for individuals focused on economic mobility, you can really tap into all of us as a Metro area to be able to partner and provide the resources necessary for an individual to be successful and to really lift up the economic mobility of the Metro region. This is scalable. You can take this and move it to any part of the state because all you're really doing is bringing together all of your providers from education, industry and workforce perspective, bringing them all to the same table and all row together in the same direction. So we're really proud of that sort of unique piece that we have in the Metro region. And the other one that I'll highlight is a partnership is called Air Tropalous Atlanta. And so this is a public-private partnership that's centered around the airport that again brings together private industry and workforce development along with the community. To focus on how do we make the airport stay not only the busiest airport in the world, but how do you staff all of that that requires to keep that economic engine churning, not only in the footprint of Hartfield Jackson, but in Clayton County and South Fulton County, even over into Douglas or into DeKab and up Fulton industrial into Cobb County. There's a tremendous workforce that's there. And so how do we work with that to continue to provide those opportunities? And we've got some programs that we've invested into actual workforce programs to do that. And then we have two pilot programs that we're proud of in Fulton. The first is called Career Reboot Fulton and this was funded through CARES Act funding and Rescue Act funding where we basically took individuals that are impacted by COVID, worked with them on digital literacy and short-term credentials to get them back into the job market faster. To date we've served over 2,000 individuals with over 600 placed into employment. Those numbers will continue to go up as we continue to get positive outcomes. And then the other is we are very proud that Fulton is the first workforce board in the state that has partnered with the Department of Human Services and the State SNAP office to co-enroll individuals into SNAP employment and training and to WAOA. And so the idea here is really better government to align these programs for individuals that are enrolled in multiple programs, make it easier on them. They can spend more time in training going to work and less time dealing with a government office. And the idea is that also that better wraps around the services of those barriers they may have, align those systems so that we can cover the training and the supportive services. We know from our data that individuals who are in training that have some sort of a resource support, be it transportation housing, or childcare, fare far better than individuals in our training programs that have no support. So we're trying to align that and then roll it out to the rest of the state based on the model that we achieve here in Fulton. So there's my comments Mr. Chair, I'll turn it over for any questions. That was fantastic. I couldn't agree more on how sometimes we de-insend people that you mentioned and Ryan did as well of getting to that next threshold. And it is something that has to be one of the outcomes of this committee of what we can do right from a state level or if not working with our counterparts, whether it be federal or other to help solve some of those problems. So thank you for that. This was well done. Questions to committee members? Mr. Chairman, there's Brett's up there. Brett, if you could talk a little bit more about the funding mechanism as far as the money coming to Georgia and how it has been declining the last few years. And some of the, since it's primarily focused on the unemployment rate, there's other things that Georgia's missing out on because of how it is appropriate from the federal government. I think that's something we need to see and hear and talk about as far as losing the impact of reskill folks in the future based on that funding. Yes. Commissioner has probably been had his ear talked off about this. So these federal we owe a dollars are it's the latest in a long line of federal workforce programs. The funding formula has not been changed in over 40 years. It's three different buckets, adults, dislocated workers and youth and each of those has a major two-thirds of the formula is based off of things like excess unemployment and poverty numbers. So Georgia has done a great job of attracting business and jobs to the state. We've got a low unemployment rate and our reward for doing such a great job of getting people to work is less money to continue to meet the need of these employers that are locating or expanding in the state. So you talk about what's going on with the JDA down on the coast and all these great job openings that are coming but we don't have the resources to train that workforce. Same thing here in the metro area any part of the state as those dollars are attached to a lower and lower unemployment rate how do we invest in and train tomorrow's workforce. So that is one of the challenges we faced. I think over the last five years if I'm correct the state is down on most 30 million dollars annually. So that is a third of our budgets cut over the last five years. There has been some investment from the state in terms of the apprenticeship dollars and things like that. We have done everything we can to cut costs. You know the Hope Career Grant is a tremendous asset for us of really cutting tuition dollars by sending an individual to school for free but we've got to find how to make up those dollars because at the end of the day when the federal dollars are cut it means fewer individuals can enroll in our programs and be trained. A number of us have waiting lists of people waiting to be served and just waiting for more funding to be able to enter into training. Any other questions from the committee members? Okay seeing Brett thank you for your presentation. Alright it's right at three o'clock so we're going to wrap up here in just a moment. I want to begin where we or end where we started which was thanking everyone for participating. You'll see in the back of the room Ali Wavrehand Miss Ali Farmroom helps make all this happen. If you've got questions about what's happening with the committee as far as scheduling, putting things together, Ali is kind of quarterbacking and project managing that process for us. For the committee members we heard a lot of wonderful testimony today. I've done a lot of study committees and I found is you can't wait to document stuff until you're in the fifth meeting because you will forget some of the great things that we heard in the first several meetings. So Haley is capturing all that stuff. I'm going to ask you that if you took down some notes and you had something you're passionate about to follow up and send those email over to us so we can see our caption them. Also in the back I see Brad Vaughn with Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones office who's helping us out. Thank you for participating representing our Lieutenant Governor and the Lieutenant Governor is going to come to one of

future meetings to address the committee. Again, this was his priority and we're just glad to be able to serve and support that initiative for him. I also want to take a moment to acknowledge I know a couple of folks mentioned Governor Campbell in opening up our state. Being the first to open up the state has led to our state having either at or hovering in the lowest unemployment ever in the history of our state, which has been truly extraordinary. Here again, our next meeting is going to be July 25th in Savannah. I'm going to guess Mark would get you a room at the planters in and he would have to host you with great customer service at a favorable rate. But I hope you do try and book in your time down in Savannah to enjoy all the wonderful things that part of the state has to offer and you can get a ride for being centered Hickman on the way down. I do want to say one more thing that I think is important. We're hearing a lot of good information and jobs are so important and each one of you that communicated today talked about what it means, but it's inspirational to that person for their very first job. Well, you took a chance in them whether they worked in a restaurant or a hotel or they did it through an apprenticeship or they'd be mentored by somebody. But those that are employing today, you made the difference for that person that may be by their first car or their first home or take that first vacation with their family to build those life memories. So it's very meaningful. And one of my heroes in this world is Ronald Reagan and he always said the greatest social program ever created was a job. So the work we're doing today and we will continue to do with these next many months is very meaningful. I want to thank you again for your input. This is just the beginning and we will look forward to many meetings in the future and many meaningful pieces of legislation and budget. So with that, we will adjourn our Senate Resolution 275 Study Committee for today and I wish you all safe travels. Thank you.
