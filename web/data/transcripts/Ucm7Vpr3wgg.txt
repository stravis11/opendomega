Well good morning the hour from convening having arrived. All members, all members will please come into the chamber and take your seats. Mr. Clerk will you please ring the bell. Members of the rule committee, you rules committee, you need to be making your way to the chamber. But members, we're going to delay the vote this morning that you're of attendance that you're here. Our morning rule call vote to give an opportunity for all of our members that own rules committee to make their way to the chamber. Doorkeepers will you please close the doors. Doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed. Members will you please take your seats. Doorkeepers, if you please close the doors. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the lady from the 173rd House District, Chair Lady Darling Taylor. Representative Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I am delighted today to introduce this guest chaplain for today. He's a wonderful man. His name is Michael Lovejoy. And not only is he a wonderful community leader, he is a football coach. And he's here today with our team that won a state championship. So he has such an effect on the people of our community and the young lives that he is transforming and helping to grow into fine young men. He loves the Lord. He loves his community. And he loves the young people. I now give you and please give a warm welcome to Michael Lovejoy. Good morning. To speak of Burns and Representative Taylor, thank you for the introduction. To all who make up this collective today, it is indeed an honor and privilege to be able to share with you on today. I won't spend much time in my salutations because I've been reminded that I should exercise brevity. So I'll move on and just share what I have with you for on today. Our scripture of meditation will come from the book of Psalm, Psalms 72 verses 1 through 6. And in that Psalm, you will find these words, give your love of justice to the king, oh God, and righteousness to the king's son. Help him judge your people in the right way that the poor always be treated fairly. May the mountains yield prosperity for all and may the heels be fruitful. Help him to defend the poor to rescue the children of the needy and to crush their oppressors. May they fear you as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains in the sky. Yes, forever. May the kings rule be refreshing like rain on a freshly cut grass, like the showers that water the earth. In this particular Psalm, it is unique in that it is a scribe to King Solomon. And while Solomon was attributed to have spoken 3,000 Proverbs, composed 105 songs. Yet only two Psalms were a scribe to his name. And in this particular palace poetry, Solomon proposed as a prayer. It is a prayer seeking guidance for good government. His request and recitation revealed to us that good government is godly government. And in this particular passage of scripture, he reminds us of what godly government entails. He gives reference first to his position. And in his position, he sees himself not so much as sovereign as he does a servant. And even as we are here and gathered with this great body, as I heard, Speaker Burns say that today is also law enforcement day. That scripture teaches us that there is no greater position than that of a servant. For Jesus said, let him who desires to be great among you desire to be a servant. So in your position, we thank you for your service. And not only does he speak of his position, but he also speaks of a power. And it is a power that has the ability to empower. We saw that as representative Taylor said about our football team this year that through good leadership, you have the ability to empower. And through your service and your position, there is a power that allows you to be the voice for the voiceless. A power that enables you to be hoped for, the hopeless, a power to provide strength for those who may struggle. I thought about this as I was entering to the city on last night as I was in the vicinity of Hartfield Jackson. I saw a plane descending as I was supposed to the runway. And as I thought, I began to reflect. And I was reminded that on that plane, there were people from all walks of life. Not only were there people from all walks of life, but there were some who purchased a first-class seat. There were some who may have purchased coaching, economy seats. But because of those who were flying the plane, no matter where they were seated and what type of ticket they purchased, they all arrived at the destination at the same time. And they arrived because there was somebody who was able to guide and to lead them there safely. There was a pilot and a copilot. The Bible speaks of, in the multitude of counsel, there is safety. They were able to reach their destination safely because of guidance. Not only did those pilots rely on their skill, but there was someone who was in the tower that was directing their steps and directing them and ensuring a safe landing. And I want to tell you that in your service, there is someone in the tower who says that if you lack wisdom, all you have to do is ask. And if you seek God's wisdom, He'll grant it to you. He said liberally. And so I think that in this great state of Georgia that we are represented by great leadership, great guidance, power. And then also, He talks about a prosperity because He said that when there is those who embrace the idea, servanhood, that there is prosperity for all people, that there is a righteous rule that translates to God. That translates to peace and prosperity, prosperity to all people. And then lastly, He mentions and says that because of this power and because of the position, that there is also the thought of perpetuity because where we are guided and we're governed by time and all those who are in this chamber and apart of this great body, we are. We are led to impact lives and to make decisions that not only will mark this fiscal year, but He says that it will go beyond that which is fiscal and go into forever. So again, we thank you for your service. We thank you for the ability to empower. Thank you for all that you have been given in this great task of leading this great state of Georgia. Now if you will, I would ask that you would stand with us in a word of prayer. Father, we come today in the humbleness of our humanity and it is in this humbleness that we honor and acknowledge you. We honor you as the source of all wisdom and truth. It is our prayer that you would so empower this assembly that they may be just in their judgments and righteous in their rulings. Through that justice and righteousness, let peace and prosperity precipitate upon the people as the refreshing rains, do so to replenish your creation. Father, I pray that you would let them take concern and consider the cause of the poor. I pray that their decisions and their discussions be embodied with empathy and empathy that makes us love our neighbor as we love ourselves and empathy that will lead us to a love in a way that we would do unto others as we would have others do unto us. An empathy that will allow each member of this assembly to operate in a true spirit of wisdom, justice and moderation. That in the end of our journeys, we may hear that satisfactory salutation, servant, well done. In our most holy and divine name, we do pray, amen. If you will, join us in the pledges and leeches. Our pledges are the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands. One nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I don't take. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors and allow members to come in. Thank you, Pastor Lou Joy Coach. We appreciate you making that long journey here from South Georgia. Thank you for your words of inspiration this morning, and we most, most definitely appreciate it. And thank you. Thanks again for being here. Thank you. Members, you may greet Pastor Lou Joy in the south any room and express your appreciation for him being here with us today. Members, if you come to the floor, we will have the morning roll call. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell so members will know where we are? Okay, members, if you will come to the floor, we have a couple special recognitions. We will do the first thing and then we will move on. But at this time, we are going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Yes, please.

Mr. Whip, Whip Park. Of all members voted, their presence in the chamber. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Members will please take your seats. Today is a number of really important happenings in the House. And in this capital today is Alzheimer's Day. And I appreciate each and every one of you that did. That were your purple today. As we, this House has continued to be great supporters of Alzheimer's research. We appreciate what this House has supported over the years. It is also another pretty important day for the people of this state. It's law enforcement day at the Capitol. And I know you noticed them when you came in. A lot of blue and gray or a lot of beautiful uniforms. What can I say? Thank you all for being here. You know, this House has always stood strong supporting the heroes of different state agencies. And whatever capacity they serve that keep us safe, keep our family safe. Let us enjoy the quality of life that we enjoy here in Georgia. There are heroes that the men and women of our law enforcement agencies that every day go out and do their jobs. Support us sometimes without things. So we wanted to make sure today that we recognize them as they are around this Capitol. But also wanted to make sure they came in here to let them know just how important they are to us. This George of House of Representatives, this family, to Yalls family and law enforcement and the fraternity that Yall represent. I'm not going to introduce them all. I'm going to introduce a couple of them. One of them has a special place in this house because his father serves in this house. Colonel Billy Hitchens, if you'll stand, let's give him a round of applause. Colonel Hitchens is actually Billy Hitchens, Bill Hitchens III. You all know of the service of his father to this state and so many different capacities and now as a member of this house. But I can tell you from personal firsthand knowledge, Colonel Hitchens also recognize as Commissioner of Public Safety. But I can tell you where is that blue and gray mighty proudly. He has received numerous awards during his years of service. But let me tell you one that's very noteworthy. He was there with his father when the Olympics were here in Atlanta. If I may, Billy. Billy received the Materias Service Award for his actions during the bombing that occurred in the Olympic Park as did his father. Billy and his wife Angie both reside in states, Burnt Bullet County. He, both of them grew up. They were born and reared and effing him County, our home county. And we are very much appreciative of his success and his leadership as he leads. I think I know one of the finest, if not, no. The finest law enforcement agency in this United States and I'll think around the world, our Georgia State Patrol. Now Colonel Hitchens Commissioner graduated from the 69th Trooper School a couple years ago. A couple years ago. But I wanted you to realize this is about leadership but it's also about whether rubber meets the road. On those that keep us safe. So I want to introduce you to someone else. Trooper Cole Spires. Office number four, one four. Trooper Spires graduated from the 108th Trooper School and he's assigned to the post-own and doubling. So he helps protect Georgians on the big four lane highways, the highways and byways of Georgia. This is leadership from the top and leadership that gets the job done. Every day around our state we appreciate your service trooper end and what you do. And all of the men and women that serve in the state agencies, you see here at DNR, Georgia State Patrol, the Notacarias Division. Thank you for what you do and thank you to the sheriffs and the local law enforcement agencies and our communities around this state who put your lives on the line every day for us. So with that, I'm going to ask you all to stand. And as y'all all know, it's been a very difficult time for the Georgia State Patrol and that fraternity. That family with the laws of two troopers in the last few couple of weeks. We want to send our condolences, our prayers to their colleagues, but especially the family of Trooper Chase Redner, who tragically lost his life this week in service to us. If you will, join me in a moment of solace for Chase, a life well-lived and for his family and his colleagues. That is great. Heavenly Father, we just give you thanks for these men and women that risk their lives to protect us. Lord, we thank you for Trooper Redner, his commitment to his fellow man, to his neighbor. We ask that you be with his family and soul them, Lord, and in these days and in days it come, but always help us remember and appreciate his service to all of us and to our state. Amen. One more round of applause and I know these gentlemen and ladies would get back to doing what they came here today for is to celebrate Lord Enforcement Day at the Capitol. So let's give them a round of applause and we'll ask y'all to be dismissed. We also have Commissioner Walter Rayburn, I just saw Walter and for his officers who keep us safe as we hunt and fish, enjoy those great pursuits out of doors, and also keep us safe on our lakes and our rivers as we enjoy a great pastime, but do a great job of making sure that our people are kept safe as we enjoy. The great natural resources of this state. Thank you, Commissioner. I'm glad you're here as well. Thank you members. I appreciate that. I hope y'all feel as I do it. It was worth us taking a few minutes this morning to celebrate these men and women who keep us safe. Thank y'all. Our doctor of the day today is brought to us by our chairman Bill Gerder. Dr. Sally is that pretty close bill. Dr. Sally is here today, so if you need any assistance, you know where to get it. I'll have the chair of the committee on information and audits is recognized.

I just wanted to call colleagues. I want to extend that my invitation to my Johnson Miss High School and my district Johnson High School Knights. Like we said, they're three times state champions, national champions, 2023. These guys work really hard. We got a great program there. I asked these guys if they are all three of these are the seniors from the soccer team. What they were going to do and if they want to be a politician and they said no. And then I asked them what there's going to be and I said, when I'm saying there's going to be a attorney, a doctor and a sportsman, I said, well, you might be doomed for being a politician. But I'm going to let the coach just say a few words. Thank you all for your indulgence. Soccer teams up there in the gallery. Would you all stand up? Stand up. These are future leaders. There they are up there. Go ahead, coach. My name is Frank Samora. I had coach at Johnson High School. First of all, I want to thank the speaker, thank Representative McCollum for having us here and thank all the representatives. First of all, for supporting and pouring into high school athletics. We are a testament of what high school athletics can do and how they can transform lives. Not only did these guys were able to accomplish back-to-back championships, being named national champions as well. They were able to do it while maintaining team GPA of 3.3 and serving the community as well.

And I want you all to know that I am a member of the Machines Union for 44 years. Joining when I started at Lockheed, January 21, 1980. At this time, I would like the members of the Georgia AFL CIO to please stand as we recognize you and working you to the House of Representatives. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you, Representative. That concludes our morning orders. We'll move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1124-1124? House Bill 1124 by resident of Martin of the 49th to be titled next to the amendments. Subpart 2A, Part 3 of Article 7 of Chapter 3, Title 20. I would like to go to Georgia and attend a relaying the needs-based financial aid program. So it's required for a definition. This bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Higher Education. That committee recommends a disbill. Do pass. Chairman Chuck Martin is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm referring to you today. House Bill 1124. And as the caption said, this seeks to improve the College Completion Grant program by reducing the threshold for students to use it for a four-year program from 80 to 70%. And for the first time allowing individuals that are in a two-year program to qualify at 45%. It also extends the program through June 2027 to give the department ample time to check the new cohort. I just want to say this, 94.8% of the credit hours attempted under this grant have been passed. 94.8%, 58% of the people got their degree or certificate. And with 92% have not yet, but with almost 95% of the classes, this is a good investment for an average cost of $1,200. We're helping people cross the finish line to get their degree or certificate and make them productive. Mr. Speaker, if there's no questions, I would ask the House's favoral consideration to move Georgia forward. The gentleman has one question. Yes, sir. Representative Becky Evans to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General, please. Yes, ma'am. Yes. So is this what was known as the completion grant earlier or is this the same or different? Yes, ma'am. This is the college completion grant. Okay. If the lady would call us, we pass it last year. Something got added on the Senate that calls the gubernatorial veto. So this is that bill come again. Thank you, sir. Yes, ma'am. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Yes. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass?

This bill then referred to the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Corda Barrett is recognized to present the bill. Representative Barrett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 579 makes a few small changes to the Georgia Special Needs Scholarship Program and increases transparency therein. This program has been around since 2007 and there are approximately 6,000 students participating. I collaborated with many interested parties on this legislation and was pleased when it passed unanimously by committee. The changes will improve the program for families, school administrators and the Department of Education. It will provide scholarship estimates and amounts in a more timely manner. It updates how funds are remitted to schools. It has clarifying language about the appeals process for scholarship amounts and provides even more information into the program about the students who participate in it and on the types of conditions participating schools are able to serve. It's a great piece of legislation for a program that's working well. I would appreciate your favorable consideration on the bill. I'd be happy to take questions. Gentlemen, it has no questions. You can yield the well. I yield the well. You look good standing up there but it's time to yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous

Question being ordered that Chair Hissnun, the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the Committee's substitute that Chair Hissnun, the Committee's substitute is adopted?

Requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations, Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 993? 993. House Bill 993, by the way, is in a poll of 33 to be entitled to amend part two, part three, chapter 12, the title 16. The fish go to Georgia and Tate relaying off. Fences related to minors generally, so as a revive for the offense of grooming a minor for indecent purposes. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Juvenile Justice. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee's substitute. The gentleman from up on the lake, Chairman Ellen Powell, is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Powell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I bring to you this morning, House Bill 993. And for years, people have always said, I'm across the board on subject matter. A lot of the issues that I deal with legislatively are quite frankly products of the Committee that I've chaired over the years, whether it be public safety or regulated industries or governmental affairs or whichever Committee it might have been. But then there's also other issues that I get involved in. Most of the time, these are issues that I read about, hear about. And I want to tell you, that's what wanted the genesis of this bill. Nine thirty-four years, I didn't think that we had left any stone unturned when it came to dealing with predatory sexual behavior. And that would be dealing with minors, the children in the state. And it became obvious to me after some events that we have an issue, that we have these people who are sick, and I can't use any other word but sick. I can't use it, but I won't use those words for them. But these are people who have a pattern of behavior that they groom young children. They might be coaches. They may be ministers. They may be the song leaders. They may be teachers. They may be the uncles or the steps. But they use this pattern of behavior. More so it appears today that this behavior is being used by internet technology or social networking or cell phones or text and all of those things that have been a plague on most of our lives today. And that's what has happened. I have before you build a day that deals with grooming of minors. And why does it mean so much that when I see and hear stories of 11 and 12 year old girls and these people have started paying so much attention to them. And I'm talking about grooming if you can imagine such a word. But it's like they're getting prepared for the future. And they start them at a young age. And they compliment them and they're buying gifts or they do all kind of things. And all of a sudden when that child gets to a certain age, they're still not of age of majority consent. But that's when certain actions happen. This is a disease, ladies and gentlemen. And at any point we need to put tools out there for law enforcement and prosecutors to deal with this type of behavior. I'm not an attorney. I've been quoted a lot of times by saying I may be one of the few members of the legislature. He clearly tells people I'm not an attorney. But I do know some of the best legal minds to consult with. And I want to give fair credit to some of the folks that worked on this. First I'll give credit to Judge Stan Gunter, Chairman Gunter. He and Chairman Smith, I went to these as Chair and Judiciary about this issue because I did not want to pass a piece of legislation that would stand a chance of being able to provoke somebody for being charged for nothing more than being nice. And I went to some other people, the PAC, the prosecutors, the attorney's counsel. And they worked with me on an earlier version of this bill. It would have been an add-on charge if somebody had been a strictly an add-on charge that had been convicted. Well, we didn't move that bill last year because it just didn't feel right. But then we came back this year with the draft of what packet came forth to him. And that's what's before you now. And it was assigned to Chairman Ballinger's Committee. And I'll have to tell you in 34 years I've never been in front of Jimmy Justice. But I will tell you what an enlightening experience it was for her committee. By partisan support, almost at the point of excitement that somebody wanted to know why they had not been able to sign it. I said, well, I didn't think about it quite frankly. And Chairman Ballinger's leadership on this issue and again, PAC. Because one of the things I wanted to be absolutely certain about was that we did not ask anything that would have any constitutional questions that might give a perpetrator and their defense lawyer grounds to appeal. And that's the product that you see before you this morning. Very short, very succinct to the point. If you look as the header says, this is offenses relating to minors for the offense of grooming of a minor. The definition section in one defines computers, electronic devices, the minor itself, sexual offenses, sexual servitude. And then we get into the guts of it. A person has to be over age of 18 and no less than 48 months older than the alleged victim. There has to be a pattern of activity of knowing and intentionally performing such acts through these devices, electronic devices, third persons or whatever. If possible, they'll be convicted of a felony. They also cannot do grooming either in, within or without the state. So if they're in the state and they're grooming across the state line, they could be found guilty. Or for out of the state and grooming into the state. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a tool. It's certainly not a cure all in the sixth society that we live in today. But it's a tool for law enforcement and prosecutors. I'm fortunate or unfortunate. There are no female children in my family. I had sons, I have no sisters. I've got nieces, I've got God children that are female. And I'm always been very fond of the females because all I had surrounded me in my life was a bunch of males. And they were always had enough power with them that they defended themselves. But when I see these acts that are created against these children, and then when they get a few years older, then they're engaging in sexual behavior with these predators. To the point that it creates mental health issues, severe mental health issues, to the point that sometimes it creates a situation of suicide to these victims. Ladies and gentlemen, this is just another era in the quiver of stopping some of this behavior. Mr. Speaker, I'd be more than glad to answer any questions. And if our none, I'll step aside and ask for your favorable consideration because I don't think this is a very, very needed bill. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions? I'll be glad to stand for questions. Representative Kendrick has a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This gentleman you? Yes, ma'am. This is not true that this bill went through several versions in juvenile justice to make sure that we got the language exactly right because it is a criminal part of the code and that we came to a decision about this to make sure that we can protect minors in the state of Georgia. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. Gentlemen, you here for another question? Yes, sir. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman you? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that it is not just girls that can be groomed and enticed in this way, but boys as well can also find themselves in this situation. You're absolutely right. Thank you very much, ma'am. And I would also tell you that this is a bill that is nonpartisan in nature. This type of behavior crosses racial, gender, partisan lines. It affects every individual in the state. And I certainly would urge your consideration and vote a positive yes. Mr. Boehm, one more question. You voted someone, sir. Yes, sir. Representative, I think you need to clarify some things. Yes, sir. Let's see. Representative Chairman Gutherr is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, you? Yes, sir. Is it true that this is a multi-year process for you to put in this bill together? Yes, sir. And is it also true that you listened to suggestions and took every one of those into account? I listened to the folks that I respect. The people who have outstanding judicial knowledge, and that would be people like you, Mr. Chairman, as well as the professionals like the prosecuting as an attorney's counsel. I want to thank you for bringing this bill. I want to thank you for your help and support. Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I want to step aside and I would ask you to do something that is just and something's right, because we try to put another plug into this type of behavior. Chairman, as you did the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members have voted for what purpose does Chairman Tyler Paul Smith rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Miss Speaker, is it not true that this will close up a loophole to make sure that pure evil is helped to be eradicated in our state by not allowing those to prey on our youth? I think this House is about to take action and do just that for what purpose of representing Baysmore rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State, you're inquiry. Is it not true that this bill will also help to eradicate human trafficking? Well, I think the lady is knowledgeable about what she speaks, and I would definitely agree with her. Thank you. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 993, the Yays are 174, the Nays are zero. The bill haven't received an requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Congratulations, Chairman. Congratulations, House. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 1170? 1170. House Bill 1170, the representative of Hawkins, the 27th, being titled an act to amend Chapter 2A, Title 31, and the official go to George Anatetti, relating the Department of Public Health, to us require the certain state government buildings, courthouses, and university buildings maintained and make accessible opioid antagonists. House Bill 11 referred to the committee on Public and Community Health, that committee recommends this bill to pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Gainesville, Representative Chairman Hawkins, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think we're all aware of the opioid epidemic and now the introduction of fentanyl into our society. This bill deals with opioid antagonists, which will be available in courthouses and government buildings. It says universities, there's a definition of universities in the bill, but they have been taken out. I have to consultate you on the Board of Regents for a few reasons. But the premise of this bill is to provide those antagonists in government building next to an AED. So especially like in small towns where the courthouse is in the center of town, you have coffee shops and shops around. People will know where that is and they can actually go to the courthouse, get it and save someone's life. When you enter this building and go past the guard station on the left, there's an AED on the wall and one of these antagonist dispensers there. So if there are not any questions, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'm asking for your favorable support. You have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Chairman has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1170. The AES are 166. The NA is one. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1199, 1199? House Bill 1199. By the way, I represent a percol 169th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 5625. I'll be the official go to Georgia annotator relating the maintenance of statistics on architectural and engineering firms doing business with the state in eligibility firms. This bill haven't served the committee on governmental affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Percol has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, House Bill 1199. Since 1970, our state auditor has conducted a monthly report from every department, every agency, every authority, every public corporation within the state on all architectural and engineering firms doing business with the state with a 36 month period. Similarly, since 1970, no one has read this report. This bill merely seeks to provide efficiencies in this data and collecting it annually, rather than monthly, and publishing as part of the Transparency and Government Act. This is my understanding the state auditor and tends to make these statistics available online to provide additional transparency. And maybe in the hope someone will read this. This comes as a recommendation of the World of Mental Counsel. Good limited government. I'd love to get your green support for this bill. Gentlemen has no questions. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, as you do the well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? That Chair here has none of the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? That Chair here has none of the committee substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? That Chair here has none of the committee has agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1199. The yeas are 166. The naysayers zero. This bill receiving the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1203-1203? House Bill 1203 by Representative Kelly. The 16th and others to be entitled to amend Article 3H, Chapter 7, and Title 44 of the official go to Georgia and attendee relating to dispossessory proceedings. So those to authorize landlords to use certain off-duty sheriffs, constables, or marshals. This bill I've referred to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Trade Kelly is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Speaker. Colleagues, I come before you today with House Bill 1203, which is a bipartisan measure that passed unanimously out of the House Judiciary Committee. My House Bill 1203 aims to do is provide landlords an alternative method for service for Ritz of possession. If they choose to do so after a period of 14 days is passed, and the original officer is unable to serve the Ritz of possession, it gives them the opportunity at their own expense to hire a sheriff, constable, or marshal, an off-duty sheriff, marshal, or constable from that jurisdiction to deliver that Ritz of possession. Mr. Speaker, fairly simple bill, but I'll be glad to answer any questions. Should there be any? Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. I'll be glad to yield. Representative Silcox, do you're right in the back? Has a question. Representative Silcox, recognize for a question. Does the gentleman yield? To my friend, of course. Representative Kelly, I thank you for bringing this bill. Isn't it true that in the full county alone, there are over 3,200 Ritz of possession outstanding for eviction? The general lady is correct. What we heard is that there's just a labor shortage, not enough officers that are able to serve those, and this will provide an alternate method for us to list some of the other agencies in Fullton County that assist with that. Will you further yield? I will. Isn't it also true that this will allow these off-duty policemen in the same jurisdiction to make additional monies on top of their salaries and speed up the process as well? Absolutely. I think it's a bill that works for the landlord and for our law enforcement officers. And I think we'll always celebrate law enforcement day today. It's a great time to pass this legislation. I appreciate all your help on it. I thank you for the bill. Thank you. The owner of the center out, Chairman Collins, is recognized for a question. Does my friend from Seager Town yield? Yes, sir. I'll be glad to yield. Is it not true that an overwhelming majority of police department sheriff's offices, if they have an officer or a deputy that's going to have a part-time job away from their full-time job, that they have to get permission from that jurisdiction through the chief of police or through the sheriff's office. And that's just a good way that we put guardrails on some of this oversight here. The gentleman knows what he speaks. And what we do in this legislation is also makes, they'll have to get clearance from their agency they work for, but they'll also still have to provide a list to the agency that's originally responsible for delivering as well. General, I have a couple more if you'll take them. I'll take them to speak. Representative Reeves has a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, gentlemen, yield. I'll be glad to yield. Is it not true that this bill will help clear out backlogs that were created in COVID and that remain today and that are hurting landlords? It will. It will provide more housing opportunities across our communities. Thank you for the question. Chairman Carpenter to your right in the back has a question. Chairman Carpenter. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. It's not true that this bill will be a first step for affordable housing in the state of Georgia as it currently states 13 months for people to get evicted. The people that are paying or paying more to cover the cost of people that aren't paying. I couldn't agree more with that sentiment. I appreciate the question. Appreciate the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I know we've answered a few questions and there's a few other speakers signed up to speak for the measure. So at this time, I'll ask for the body's payroll consideration and I'll yield the will. Do we have a couple of speakers signed up? Representative Shae Roberts has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello, colleagues. I am one of the co-sponsors of HB-1203 and very happy to support it. Just to give you an example, my law firm represents several commercial shopping centers, owners, and often our clients are waiting months and months after the judges issued the writ. But because of, there was a huge backlog after COVID, we're just struggling to get these served and meanwhile, the property owners are still paying mortgages and expenses and not able to re-rent the property. It's extremely expensive and this bill gives Sheriff some extra way to make a little extra money and relieve the financial burden on the property owners. I appreciate my friend, Rep Kelly, for carrying this bill and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Representative Yasmin Neal has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you to the speaker. I rise in favor of Hospital 1203. I know my colleagues have echoes and sentiments. I actually thought about just waving, but I wanted to just let the body know about my support. It's a great opportunity for law enforcement to help the courts and also an opportunity or a much-need opportunity to supplement their incomes while helping the courts, especially for those areas such as our rural areas in Georgia where our officers are paid lower than other areas across the state. I also know my judges in Clayton County are excited about this bill because we desperately need help in this area. So join me, join us in supporting House Bill 1203. Thank you. The lady has yielded the well. She had a question, but she's yielded the well. Do you want to take a question? She's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here is none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1203, the yeas are 168. The nay is won. This bill haven't received your requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 986, 986? House Bill 986, by the represent of Thomas, the 21st and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2, a title 21 of the official code of Georgia and it's an election in primary generally. So it's established the criminal offense of election interference with a deep fake and solicitation of such this bill. I've referred to the committee on governor affairs. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Brad Thomas is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise to present House Bill 986, LC number 56013.

We want to ask. The first part of this bill creates two crimes of fraudulent election interference. And I want to put emphasis on the fact that it says fraudulent. There's many different types of protected free speech. We want to protect good political free speech, but fraud is not protected free speech. And that's what this bill is going after. It does so by publishing broadcasting, streaming, or uploading materially deceptive media, with most importantly, with the knowledge of its falsity. And within 90 days of an election, it defines some materially deceptive media as a video, video file, audio recording, audio file, still image, or still image file that appears to depict a real individual speech or conduct that did not occur in reality. And in addition, it would have to appear to a reasonable person to be authentic. Secondly, it prescribes a person to be someone within campaigns, political parties, PACs, or political committees. So it's very prescribed. 98.5% of Georgians do not fall under these categories. Secondly, it creates the crime of solicitation of election interference by a person just for encouraging an individual to commit the offense. It also adds transparency requirements by creating requirements to disclose if content is AI generated. I think it's worth noting that we have put significant protections in this bill to ensure that the judicial branch understands the will of the General Assembly and its dedication to the First Amendment. And 55 through 57 clearly state nothing in this code section applying to activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, including but not limited to, satire, parody, or memes, works of artistic expression, or works of journalism, and anybody that tells you otherwise is just flat out I and to you. This bill has significant safeguards against law fair and has transparency requirements. It requires an investigation be conducted by the Board of Elections. And in line 94 through 95, it has a transparency requirement requiring that the findings of any completed investigation be made public. Additionally, it decentralizes this by bringing in the Attorney General's Office for concurrent jurisdiction. This way we make sure that we have a checks and balances between the State Board of Elections and the Attorney General's Office. That's the basic outline of what the bill does, Mr. Speaker, and then I'd be happy to take questions. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, has a couple questions. To your left representative, Jasmine Clark has recognized for our question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I'm very curious. Why did you all decide to do it within 90 days? So a person could make a deep fake four months out from the election day, and it would be completely legal, but three months out, it is now illegal. That's a very good question. Thank you for asking it. The thing is, we have to tightly prescribe this bill to an election. And by giving it a set date from an election, it makes sure that we're saying we do not want election interference in our elections in the state of Georgia. Could we extend it for a longer period of time? Maybe, but right now there's just no, there's no case law, there's nothing to support going forward. So we felt like we wrote this as tight as we could to make sure that they would stand this scrutiny of the First Amendment tests. Does the gentleman further yield? I do. Are you open to extending the time period because I think that most of us in this room that have to campaign know that campaigns start well before 90 days before the election, and I would be concerned that limiting or allowing this to happen 180 days before the election. So basically six months before the damage would still be done. And so I think a campaign season, I think we could probably come up with a different number. Are you open to that? I mean, I would be, I'd like to get some guidance from the judicial branch in some case law to say, you know, what are our guardrails? Right now we just had to make sure we kept it as tightly prescripted as possible because if it does stand a First Amendment challenge, we want to be able to come back and we want the judicial system to say this is within the bounds. And that was the goal of the bill. Thank you. Thank you. Representative Ridley to your right has a question in the back. Representative Ridley has recognized for a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Could this bill be weaponized against the campaign volunteer? So that's an excellent question. Thank you for asking. The thing is that we have to talk about the crime. What is the crime? The crime here is to publish broadcast stream or upload materially deceptive media with the knowledge of its falsity. That's the crime. So campaign volunteer knocking doors in no way is any way going to be affected by this bill. Thank you. Yeah. Representative Yasmininio to your left extreme kind of behind you here is recognized for a question. Representative Niel. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true? Well, I think the question is trying to ask. Does this bill address the physical, like physical flyers, tangible media that you would get in your mailers, what have you, or is it only for visual, online media, in the second part of the question? So someone tells lies about a person or a candidate, like be a text on social media, what have you. Does this cover that at all? So yes, it does. It's materially deceptive media. But it has to meet two criteria and I go back to this again. It has to depict a real individual's speech or conduct that did not occur in reality and it would have to appear to a reasonable observer to be authentic. Does the gentleman further yield? I do. I'm looking at last 32 through 34 and I'm finding that I don't see where it clarifies that materially deceptive media actually covers those things. It looks like it's only physical digital. Well, you would use an audio file or still image in your case that you're talking about, which is online 34. Still image. Still image. Still physical, tangible image. Yes, that counts for him. That may ever occur in reality. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman Warkhizer, to your left is recognized for a question. The gentleman will take a question. Thank you, Miss Bigger. Mr. Jim and you. I do. There's been a lot of questions in debate about the infringing on our First Amendment. Is it not true that there was a lot of attorneys, not just locally, but from all of the country that their entire living is based on offending the First Amendment and that they support this bill? I mean, I can't speak for every attorney, but I can tell you that it has been thoroughly vetted by several attorneys across the country and many of your First Amendment rights attorneys. Thank you. General has a couple more if you'll take them. Yeah, I'll take one or two more, Mr. Speaker. Will Park has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Excuse me. Is it not true that there was a lot of that this bill was vetted multiple times in the committee and I've asked questions to potentially expand the scope of this bill, but to ensure that it addresses concerns across the spectrum, it's been narrowly tailored. That is true. And to your point, we've had hours and hours of debate. We've made everything available for public input and that's gotten us where we are today. Thank you for the question. Will the gentleman yield for one more question? Yes, sir. Is it true that the dangers and threats of deep fakes with the advancements of AI and AGI are very real threats that should concern all folks regardless of political partisanship? Yes, I would agree with you again. This is a real problem and a real concern for the upcoming election cycle. And we in Georgia are leading by doing this. So thank you for the question. Thank you. The gentleman, I do. Is it not true that fault statements are not protected by the First Amendment? That is true. Is it also not, if you further yield? I do. Is it also not true that fraud is not protected by the First Amendment and that we have numerous criminal statutes and civil statutes that give claims for fraudulent activity? That is true. Thank you. Gentlemen, yield for another question. I'll yield for one more, Mr. Speaker. Repetition, the whole come is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. And just to make sure that I understand it, the key part of the criminal component seems to be lines 33 to 37 and specifically that an individual is pretending to be somebody else and pretending to then make statements on behalf of that person, correct? That would be correct. Okay. Help me understand on the page six lines 122. It says, notwithstanding the prohibitions in 21, 2, 605, which are where we criminalize it, it seems that you can do it as long as you then have a disclosure that those events may not be real. It does put a transparency component into this because again, if there's questions on the material, whether it's legitimate or not, this would again preempt that and say, okay, well, we know that this is a generator of AI that's been used to create these images. And I think even more importantly, it says that the events depicted may not have actually occurred. And I think what we're looking for is an informed voter. And these prescriptions allow to inform the voter. So thank you for the question. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask for everyone's favorable consideration. Gentlemen has yielded the well. Okay, we're in its wisdom, the rules committee this morning enacted House Rule 33.3 to debate on this issue to limit it to one hour. We have 30 minutes for those in favor, 30 minutes for those opposed in 20 minutes for the chair's time. At this time, I'll recognize Representative Charlie's bird to speak in opposition to the bill. Representative bird. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, House members and guests. Thank you for the opportunity to address you. I stand where many eloquent orators have put great ideas into powerful words and humbling to simply be allowed to stand where they once stood, much less added my words to theirs. I rise to speak in opposition of HB 986. The question before this body today is liberty versus security. It is much the same as the decision made in 1918 by Congress of the United States of America to pass this edition act of 1918, which subsequently used by Woodrow Wilson to prosecute anyone who dare speak against him. This decision is like made by Congress to pass the edition act of 1798. So the federal government could prosecute anyone who dare criticize the president or his party. Even more recently, the United States of America Patriot Act of 2001 used to violate the constitutional right to privacy under a veil of secrecy. In all of these instances, security won. But at what cost? Even in the process of providing security, you abolish liberty. What are we even protecting at that point? Mr. Speaker, as someone who votes red a lot, I think I will be voting red harder on this one. This bill is in a front on our First Amendment rights. They say HB 986 has improved. However, this is not preserving our liberties. We are gathered at a crossroads faced with a bill that while polished to a deceptive shine threatens to erode the bedrock of freedom. This bill aims to criminalize the creation and distribution of what they call deceptive digital content in the run-up to an election. I understand that parameters were established, but with all due respect, it is not good enough. I will share a small portion of a story from Crack Tucker Carlson dated November 9, 2023. Quote, if someone told you 10 years ago that you could be indicted by the federal government and go to prison for 10 years for making fun of Hillary Clinton on social media, you would have never believed it. It is a free country. We have free speech. But it turns out not only is that possible, it is likely to become much more common because the actual war is on information. One of the first casualties is a man named Doug Mackey from Vermont who during the 2016 election made fun of Hillary Clinton on Twitter using means and jokes. 10 FBI agents and local police descended upon his home to arrest him. I am still trying to get my head around that entire story. Requiring a referral from the State Elections Board does not diminish the concerns. It simply brings us back to 1798 allowing whichever political party is in power to punish, push for the prosecution of their foes while holding no personal accountability, much like the Sedition Act of 1798 used to target critics of the president and his party while not daring to do the same to the critics of the party. The idea that a body appointed by politicians cannot be politicized is naive. Certainly my friends across the aisle should be concerned about how this could be used against them and their supporters. I implore my colleagues in the majority to see this. Anything to benefit us while in power can be used against us in the future. Narrowing the scope of the individual's eligible to be prosecuted under this bill is inadequate for protecting freedom. It does not apply to everyone. The scope is not even limited to the staff of a campaign. Anyone affiliated with a political party, political body, candidate, campaign committee, political action committee or any other political committee would be eligible for prosecution. Those affiliated with a political party or political body are a very broad and large group of people. A party activist could absolutely be prosecuted for going a little too far and a little too hard on Facebook with means. This is a dangerous law to have on the books. I do not address you today to cast out on the intent of my colleagues. We do often talk in this esteemed chamber about unintended consequences. Every year we have many bills designed to simply correct unintended consequences of bills past the prior year. Again, the First Amendment is the bedrock of this country. I implore you to have the same courage that fueled our founding fathers into signing their own death warrant, the Declaration of Independence, and the face of tyranny because they knew the freedom demands bold action. I urge you to vote no against HB 986. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. She had a question, but she's yielded the well. That concludes our speaker's opposed the bill. Now we'll move on to the chair's time. Chairman Todd Jones has recognized to speak to the bill for up to 20 minutes. I've been asked to limit my, well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've been asked to limit my remarks below 30 minutes, so tie me to 29 if you don't mind. I think, first and foremost, when I first took office, one of the things that I talked a lot about was constituent services and great policy. Great policy assumes one very critical thing that I believe our founders thought through every day. And that was the idea of intelligent banter. That was the idea of good ideas against other good ideas to create great ideas. It was not about basically the misinformation campaign that could possibly go on in the day of the internet. Our forefathers assumed a town square. Our forefathers assumed the idea of meeting in constitutional hall. I'm not suggesting that they couldn't see the future, but they probably could not see a future where instantaneously within five seconds a rash of misinformation could go across our entire state. Many of you have received information over the last 24 hours that frankly I'm saddened by. Those individuals claim to want to be part of a process that gives us great policy in our state. They claim to be the ones that they don't want us to have unintentional consequences as the previous speaker spoke to. But I wonder if that's truly the case. Because as I review what has been sent out, what has been sent out conveniently misses the definition section. Little hard to look at a bill and look at the contents of that bill without first understanding what the definitions are. A lay person reading the bill without access to the definition of person wouldn't truly understand what person is as it relates to 986. The former speaker spoke to the ideas that quote everyone could be trapped within the definition of person. I respectfully disagree. A person is clearly someone who is an employee of a contractor of are similarly situated. Similarly situated and employee and contractor cannot be confused. That is not a volunteer. That is not someone who walks. That is not someone who basically knocks on doors. But that is someone who is similarly situated. In addition to that, we also have the requirement that they are part of a formal campaign, they are part of a PAC, part of a committee, etc. Further, the former speaker, the previous speaker spoke to the idea of the Vermont case and the mean. I can assure you, this bill does not catch that person in any type of trap. Because I would ask you to look at the definition of materially deceptive media. That definition alone that you will find in the bill, onlines 33 through 34, make it very clear that you must first and foremost, it must appear to be the real individual's speech or conduct. I want to say that one more time depict the real individual's speech or conduct and reasonable to the observer. That is a critical distinction between a meme and basically a video that purports in Turkey. We saw in an election last year where gender AI was used to depict an individual soliciting a prostitute. That individual did no such thing. It was shown to throw an individual smoking on a legal substance. That individual did no such thing. It used to be that the lies that went through the political process that unfortunately are protected, unfortunately sometimes by the First Amendment, were too dimensional. They would show up on a TV screen, they would show up on a mailer. But now we're talking about three dimensional in terms of video, in terms of audio. The idea that you can depict the current president's voice and do a robo call and let literally people believe that the election has been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Decreasing turnout. This body has talked about liberty. It has talked about freedom, but it has also talked about an election integrity a hundred times in the last three years. How can we have election integrity without knowing what the candidates are saying and what they're truthfully saying, what they truthfully believe in? I know no person in this body who does not believe in freedom and liberty, but I do know this. There are operatives in this state who would prefer to use gender of AI and deceptive media to be able to take over the integrity of our elections. It's not enough that we go through how the ballots will be done, how the counting will be done, how the audits will be done. But rather leading up to that election, that individual going into the voter box must know what you believe in. And that can't be done if someone is deceptively using your name, your image, your likeness, not possible. So I ask you this. We've spoken the entire morning about the first part of this bill. I'm going to flip very quickly to the second part of this bill because for some reason, those that have permeated this misinformation failed to talk about the second part of this bill. The second part of this bill is critical. It's critical for us as a body and it's critical for us as a republic and to be the bedrock of this democracy and that's this. No one is saying you can't use gender of AI and I want to tell you something, I'm probably going to use it in my campaign this year. What the second part talks to though is you must disclose it. What's wrong with that? Hi, I'm Todd Jones and I approve the use of gender of AI in this particular ad, in this particular video, in this particular audio. Don't we want truth and advertising? This is not a difference between freedom and liberty, absolutely not. This is a difference between ensuring that we have an lecturing integrity, ensuring that the falsities that people are peddling over the last 24 hours do not win the day within this chamber. I respectfully ask this body for its favorable consideration of HB 986 and Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well, that completes our discussion on House bill 986. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here is none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agree to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose this chair let it camp, Roz? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that on February 16th this year, 20 tech companies including Adobe, Amazon, Google, Metta, OpenAI, Microsoft, TikTok and more, signed a voluntarily pledge to help prevent deceptive AI from disrupting the voting in the 2020. No, the lady knows reflects and she keeps them straight. So I believe that to be true. What purpose is represented? Jasmine Clark, Roz. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that while I understand and support the intent of this bill, I really do have problems with it only being within 90 days because things live on the internet much longer than that. I know the lady stated that concern. If it passes this house as it appears it may, she can have those concerns heard over the Senate. But what purpose is represented? Canard rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that I share this concern, but don't we have sufficient slander and liable laws on the books now for this offense? Is it not sufficient? I'm sure the gentleman probably believes that is if that's his reading, his understanding. For what purpose does Rep. Cheerleady Darling Taylor arise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that no one has the right to use an image of me or my voice and to put words in my mouth that I did not say using AI in misrepresent what my thoughts are. That's why I'm voting for this bill. I'm sure the lady believes just what she stated. For what purpose is represented? Lisa Campbell rise. Thank you Mr. Speaker, Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that I also support truth in advertising, fairness, and security and elections? But this bill limits our ability to manage that through its 90-day window and also in lines 123 through 127. Basically gives cover to using AI deceptively as long as there is a disclosure.

I heard about it, it's a disclosure, I didn't hear about it, it's a sector piece. For what purpose is chair, chair lady, Halston, Roz? Is it not true that I'm not sure? Is it inquiry? Pauper inquiry. Yes ma'am. Is it not true that I'm trying to get my head around why it is a liberty to burn somebody's life in fits in election? That's a good question, chair lady. And it seems it's the way of the world these days. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. Own the passage of House Bill 986. The yeas are 148 and nays are 22. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Resolution 918-918? House resolution 918 by Representative Mathis, the 149th resolution, designating the golden aisle greenway as an official corridor in Georgia. This resolution haven't been referred to as the Committee on Transportation. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Representative Mathis, you ready to go? Representative Mathis is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring to you House Resolution 918. It's to have an official corridor, the golden aisle greenway. What we're trying to do is to generate tourism, economic growth, to set ourselves up for federal and state funds to get a section of this greenway from Twigs County, Black and County, Dodge County and Parks to Bill. We think it will help us in those areas of economic and tourism. There's only a small section of this corridor that we're wanting to do that needs to be four-lane. It's from exit six to highway 96, which is about a 20-mile stretch. If we could get that done, it would open up from all the way from making at exit six, all the way to Brunswick, the golden aisle partway. We do think this would be a great exit. It will take off some of the traffic off 16, and it will also take some of the traffic off for 75. And we think this is the shortest and most beautiful way down to our golden aisle coast with the middle Georgia ride that you'll have for this. So Mr. Speaker, with that, I'll ask for favorable consideration. And if there are no questions, I'll yield the way. You have one question that I will allow in this bill because you've just presented a bill that could be very impactful. Chair Lady Lynn Smith has recognized for a question. If you'll accept a question. I will be honored to accept it. Gentlemen Ye old. Yes ma'am. I thank you for this initiative. It's one who drives this route all the time. And I'd like to be able to get off that road every now and then and have a pleasant drive. So thank you for what you're doing. Well I thank you. It's so wonderful on this part that all the bridges from this 20-mile stretch are already fixed for four lanes. So it'd be ready to go. All we'd have to do is just get a picture of that four lane. We'll have all the way to the coast. Thank you very much. No more questions I yield away. Gentlemen, as you're the well, good luck. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? The Chair has none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report to the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The Chair has none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor, the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose does Chairman Collins rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. As a member of the Undertaker Caucus, is it not truth? This also will serve as a testament to our senior member in his golden years. Well, you covered a lot of ground on there on that one, so I'm not sure the gentleman knows what he speaks and believes it to. No. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House Resolution 918. The yeas are 168. The nays are zero. The resolution haven't received any records. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, if you'll join with me and welcome me, a former member of this House, former member of Representative Ralph Long. Ralph's good to see you, man. Representative Ralph Long. Good to have you back. Your reputations intact. Be careful who you talk to back down there. That would be that part. Mr. Clerk, we'll read the caption to House Bill 1207-1207. I represent a plumbing of the 114th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 2, Title 21 of the official code of Georgia annotated, relating the elections and primaries generally so to provide for proofing of ballots by local superintendents in certain races. Mr. Bill, I'm referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Tim Fleming is recognized our only Fleming now to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 1207. It's an elections bill and what it simply does is it allows a 24-hour time period for ballot proofing by candidates. So if you're on the ballot, a candidate will be able to proof their sample ballot with their race to check for spelling. Make sure their district numbers correct if they're a component needs to be on there. How that process would work after a candidate qualifying is over. The Secretary of State's office builds the ballots. And then once they finish their process of ballot building and proofing they send it to each county's election superintendent. They then go through their process of checking the ballots for races and their community. Once that process is finished at the county level, there would be a 24-hour period where the sample ballots would be melded to the candidates. And if you choose to as a candidate, you can proof your ballot to make sure all your information that you put on your qualifying forms is correctly put on the ballot before the ballots are printed so there won't be any issues. If a candidate finds an issue on the ballot with their race and their name, then they work it out with the local election superintendent to get that corrected. If a candidate chooses not to review it, they do not have to do it. There would be a 24-hour time period that the Secretary of State's office would set after qualifying. And all candidates would be notified ahead of time when that 24-hour time period would be and then the ballots would be emailed to the candidates on that ballot. That's what the bill does, Mr. Speaker. If there's any questions, I'd be happy to take a few. Gentlemen, you have a far question? Yes, sir. Chairman LeHood to your right has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Would the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1207, the yeas are 168, the nays are zero. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? I'm sure that applause is well needed and well received. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption of House Bill 843? 843. House Bill 843 by Representative Stevens and the 164th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 3, a title 3. The official go to Georgia annotated, related to regulation of alcoholic beverages generally. So it's been applied for Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises and locally designated special entertainment districts. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman from the coast, Chairman Ron Stevens is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Miss Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House, I'll bring you House Bill 843 today. This bill strictly and totally only applies to those areas. The state designated special entertainment districts as it relates to alcohol. Georgia alcohol sales vary across the state by jurisdiction and that's exactly what we want as local control. But state law sets the earliest and latest the sales times for each day of the week. Generally, Sunday sales of alcohol is allowed by local governments for Sunday sales of service and bars and restress beginning at 11 a.m. on Sunday. No later than 11 30 p.m. There is exceptions to the state law. Currently the exceptions are the stadiums, coliseums, auditoriums and these special entertainment districts. There are two in the state of Georgia. One is River Street in Savannah, Georgia and the other is Underground Atlanta here, which has had its problems over the years. This legislation pertains only to the special service districts that are defined in the code and set up many years ago. Underground Atlanta, of course, qualifies under Georgia law, was designated as a special entertainment district. This legislation simply allows Underground Atlanta to continue to qualify as a special entertainment district. The meat of the language, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, it is on line 14, which allows the special entertainment district to qualify as a project which receives or has received whole and part public funds. That's all it does. It will allow the Underground Atlanta, once there is an economic development, massive economic development investment there to continue to be a special entertainment district. I will answer any questions if there are any and if not, I'll you the well. Someone has a question, Chairman Tarvan, to your right in the back house of question. Chairman Tarvan? Chairman Liu? Yes, sir. Does this bill in any way interfere with local control and would force any local county or city to allow this without their permission? That's a very good question. It does not. Thank you, sir. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask for your favorable consideration and I'll yield the well. Chairman, as you do the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Hears none of the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? That Chair Hears none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote. Yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 843. The yeas are 151. The nays are 13. This bill, having received the record, the constitutional majority is therefore passed. I know I've spent on y'all's mind this morning that the Senate was going to come in and go to work and I think they finally did. So that's a good thing. Yes. The table falls. Chairman Hatchett is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this House disagree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 915. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 915 by Representative Burns 159. Jones, 47th, abstraction to the 104th and others to be entitled, neck to amend and act, and providing appropriations for the state fiscal year, beginning July 1, 2023, and ending June 30, 2024, known as the General Appropriations Act. Chairman Hatchett, I thought you had a perfect bill when you sent it over there. Was it not? Chairman Hatchett is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Y'all, this is just the amended budget. And we have disagreements. So this starts the process and the next time it will start the process, so we can start working to come to a resolution. On the gentleman's motion that the House disagreed to the Senate substitute is their objection. Here in none, the House has disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 915. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10491049? House Bill 1049 by Representative Williamson of the 112th to be an act to amend chapter 52 in Title 33 of the fiscal year. The Georgia Annotated Relingen Assumption Reassurance Agreements, so to enact the Insurance Business Transfer Act. This bill I have referred to the Committee on Insurance. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Chairman Bruce Williamson is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, the rise before you today to present House Bill 1049 by Committee Substitute LC520447S. Quite simply, this is the title of this is Insurance Business Transfer Act. It simply provides a model for the State of Georgia for Georgia, Domicide Insurance Companies to purchase or sell books of business. It's got sufficient guardrails around it when the insurance commissioner is office and a per the court review at any point in time. Anybody can object to it. All policy holders are notified. And what it'll do is, again, it allows insurance companies, if they might be overly concentrated in one line of risks, they can rebounce and work for the reinsurance market as well. So it should provide even a more attractive place for insurance companies, the domicile here, to allow them to enter into this marketplace. I'll be happy to answer any questions here and then. This is a model legislation for National Insurance Commissioners. It's been vetted by the Insurance Commissioners' office, our insolvency pool. There was no objections to the bill and it came out unanimously out of Chairman Lumpston's insurance committee. Again, I'll be happy to answer any questions if not on the SPF. There's a question from your cousin from the coast representing L Williams, if you'd yield for a question. Well, the gentleman yield. Happy to. Isn't that true? That while I like the intent that in a very recent past, a major insurer of church policies pulled out of Georgia because of experiences in Florida doesn't sound too good. It might be legal, but it had a terrible stink to it. Is that natural? I'm not familiar with that situation, but there's a lot of reasons insurance carriers might want to leave the state of Georgia, but this allows more flexibility for insurance companies to in fact rebalance their books of RIS with all these guard wheels around it. It might be more likely that insurance companies could stay in the state of Georgia if they get overly concentrated in one risk area. I hate to use it analogous to laying off bets or whatever. I'm not a better, but it allows them to better manage the RIS where one event or one type series of events doesn't take them down. Again, it comes with all the proper financial oversight. Well, gentlemen, further you know. Is it not true finally that while I agree with the concept, I just would hope that we'd keep in mind that this particular company does only churches which probably have the lowest rate of losses of any category. Is it not so that I'm concerned about other folk because of losses in other states pulling out of our market other than that? Is it not true that I'm supportive of the bill? Well, thank you so much, Representative Williams. I appreciate you support. No more questions, Mr. Chair. You have another question. I just want to say thank you, Representative Williams, for making that point. That is a big concern. Hopefully this legislation will help address that. The General Yeeil Representative Kelly, to your left, has a question. Yes, sir, to my friend. Happy to yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman Yeeil. Happy to. Isn't it true that the process you've outlined in this legislation will make sure that all effective parties will have an opportunity to have their voice heard and make any objections and have those considered throughout the process. And I actually see polly seeholders as well as both sides of the transaction. That's true. I mentioned that in my remarks, but that's exactly correct. It's just another pathway. If the insurance commissioner's office approves both the buying and seller insurance companies can walk it any time and the court does have to validate it. So your answer is correct. And all policyholders are notified. Thank you for the bill. Mr. Chairman, you indulge me for one more question. That would be from Representative Jason Ridley to your right. Yes, sir. Your extreme right behind you. That's appropriate. My friend Yeeil. Yes. Is this not true that this is just a risk management tool to diversify where you don't have so much stuff. It's so much risk in one place and the banks have been doing it for years. And that's basically how you get your bond ratings or your triple A rating for as a company. That's correct. Basically they're managing their balance sheets to protect any unforet. And unwound it scenarios. And again, it's principally used by the reinsurance markets. So great question, Mr. Speaker. I yield the oil. You have no further questions. Thank you for taking those questions. Thank you, gentlemen, for the questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to a report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose does Representative Edna Jackson rise? She weighs. All members voted ifs. The clerk will unlock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1049. The yeas are 168. The nays are zero. The bill hasn't received their requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1073? House Bill 1073 by Representative Washburn and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 36 to 66. 4 of the official court of Georgia and Tatey will be hearing some proposed zoning decisions notice of hearing non-governmental initiated actions, reconsideration of defeated actions and procedures on zoning. This bill I refer to the Committee on Government Affairs. That committee recommends the dis bill. Do pass. The gentleman from BIP County, Representative Dale Washburn, is recognized to present the bill, Representative Washburn. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House come to present House Bill 1073, which changes state law to remove to repeal requirements for halfway houses, drug rehab centers and other facilities, changes the state law. It is important to note that the local governments still have their control over these kinds of rezoning and this does nothing to change local control or local ordinances. Ladies and gentlemen, in our quest to improve mental health in Georgia, this is a good bill and I urge you a favourable consideration of it. Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions. Gentlemen, has those questions? He's yielded the will. We do have a speaker. I'm pleased to recognize Representative Mary Margaret Oliver to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise very briefly to thank the sponsor of this bill and the chairman of the Public Health Committee for bringing this forward. Since this obstacle, a preemption obstacle to a specific kind of treatment facility was enacted by this General Assembly in 1998, we've made enormous improvements in progress on providing different kinds of treatment facilities for our local communities to help families in our local communities. In 1998, I don't know who in the body I was happy to have been here then, recognize that this enactment in 1998, to point out one treatment facility as having a different statewide zoning application, whether that was violation of the federal law at that time, I believe it was, and we missed it. So we're coming back today to correct. I think a little mistake we made and to make our local zoning laws more equal, more fair, and more open to the reality about the variety of treatment facilities that are coming forward on behalf of our families. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies, you, the will, thank you for your insight and observations there, and thank you for your work on mental health for all of George. We appreciate what you've done and what you're doing. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 1073, the yeas are 161, the nays are five, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1114 1114? House Bill 1114, by the way, to the ninth and others to be entitled to amend Title 33, the official go to George Annoted, relating to insurance so as to enact the data analysis for tort reform act, this bill having for committee on insurance, that committee recommends it to spill due pass. The Governor's floor leader, Representative Will Wade, is recognized to present the bill. Like speaker colleagues, I'm going to make this short and sweet to someone that told me earlier that that wasn't possible. I'm here to prove you wrong. Anyway, House Bill 1114 allows the office and directs the office of insurance and safety fire commission to collect and analyze anonymous data from insurers related to tort related risks. A report is going to be required to be submitted to the Governor, the House Committee on Insurance and the Senate Insurance and Labor Committee by November 1, 2024, and each year thereafter it would be repealed on January 1, 2030. And I'll be happy to answer any questions if needed. You do have a question. I'll take one question. I'll go to the park to your left in front of you. Has a question. Whip park. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a gentleman yield. I do. Is it not true that the purpose or substance of this bill could essentially have been accomplished in a study committee as opposed to a bill drafted by the Governor's legislative council? I don't believe that it is actually true. I do think this will actually get a sense of urgency. We've got a lot of anecdotal and qualitative data that we've all many of us have received from back home and we've got insurance companies, businesses who have serious concerns. We want to be able to get in more real time through the Office of Insurance, real data to be able to back up legislation so that we'll be ready to hit the ground running and this will help facilitate that in a quicker manner. Mr. General, you want to ask one more question? I'll you'll for one more. Are there any concerns about the effectiveness of the bill in achieving its stated goals of reducing frivolous tort litigation, especially given that there are factors beyond tort reform legislation that impact insurance premiums and other market dynamics? I think there's always concerns for most of everything that we take up here, but this will direct an opportunity to bifurcate the costs that are associated with normal, the pricing for actuarial companies to help guide that process, but to be able to separate what is the biggest impact that's coming directly from tort? Thank you. If there are no other questions. Do you have another question?

All right, I'll take your right close to your seat back there Chairman Carpenter has a question. Does the gentleman yield I do I Appreciate you bringing this legislation. Obviously as a as a person that loves and breathes small businesses We already feel the the effects and the need for tort reform and I know there's some people in this room that need to see that Analysis but I can tell you firsthand that We need some relief. So thank you for bringing the bill. Thanks, sir All right if there are no questions you have police Release a candle to your left has a question all right Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield yes, I do point of clarification Within the bill the data that will be shared the aggregate data not the personal data It's my understanding and reading this bill that that will only be shared with the commissioner and that will not Be made publicly transparent won't be published other than his report is that true? That is a good understanding of the intent we want to ensure that we protect the trade secrets and the practices that are being used by different Companies because we do have a free market system This will aggregate today that so that we don't put any one company under the microscope as to their Common practice and how they price their risk and how they do those things With the gentleman yield for a follow-on question certainly clarification sure so in the report All of the data will be shared Is that accurate not not the aggregated data? So that will be shared or just what the commissioner chooses to report on all of the data that is the for the specific Questions that are outlined in the legislation all of that data will be shared with the insurance commissioner and it would be shared with us in an aggregate format for analysis and review all of it all of it. Okay. Thank you Gentlemen has no further questions. I appreciate this body's favorable consideration. I yield the well Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none? previous question is ordered is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill The chair here's none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill We'll vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine Have all members voted Have all members voted if so Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine on the passage of house bill 1114 1114 The yeas are 132 the nays are 32 The bill having received it requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Chair recognizes representative representative hatchet for a motion Thank you mr.
