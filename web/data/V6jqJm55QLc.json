representative Emory\nDonahue representative donohoo\nthank you Mr Speaker\nhave the privilege of introducing my\nfriend\nPastor Jeff Appling he's otherwise known\nas Pastor a but first of all let me\nintroduce his beautiful most talented\nmusician and what a beautiful voice Miss\nLisa and Miss Lisa Appling\nthey they were married at three years\nold so they've been here quite a while\neven though they don't look like that\nwe uh you know I have the privilege of\nvisiting this church\nand when I go there probably several\ntimes a year it's because my middle\ndaughter Megan Seth my son-in-law we\nhave Levi we have Selah and Becca that\nlove the Grove then my son Josh Holly\nKai and Haven love the Grove I attend\nanother church but every time I can\nsneak away I go to The Grove\nnow with that being said to give you a\nlittle history The Grove is in Maysville\nGeorgia it was founded in 1802.\nThomas Jefferson was president and I can\nsee\nPastor Ray riding that mule with a straw\nhat waving holding the Bible as he\ntraveled the dirt roads to spread the\nword of God\nand that's a joke there but he's been\nthere 33 years\nso with that I want you to put your seat\nbelt on and buckle up because right now\nas not a very good golfer just in case\nhe hits one in the weeds I'm going to\ngive him a chartreuse golf ball but it's\na Titleist Pro-V\nand just in case he wants to hit it\nstraight down the Fairway we have a\ntightness Pro B and it's ready to Tee It\nUp Pastor so here you go thank you sir\nthank you thank you yes thank you\nspeaker\nwell I played golf yesterday so I need\nboth of these based off what I played so\nit's an honor for my wife and I to be\nhere we are grateful to God I am not the\nfounding pastor of the Grove but I\nI did go there in 1990 Lisa and I were\n26 years old and we began our journey in\nthe pastorate it's our first pastor and\nwe've stayed and we've enjoyed it we\nunderstand the value of planting\nsomewhere and staying somewhere and\nworking hard\nand we're grateful to God for you\nwe pray for you\nI understand leadership I have the\nopportunity of working with a fellow\nmany of you may have heard of Dr John\nMaxwell\nand for 20 years I've worked with an\norganization called equip alongside of\npastoring\nand equip is just uh it's a name that\nsimply means encouraging qualities\nundeveloped in people\nand we do it all over the world\nand God is blessed and we've had\nopportunities to travel a lot the one\nthing that I do know and understand\nfully\nis that you in this room sit\nin a leadership seat\nand a lot of people from a distance look\nat leadership and think is fun they kind\nof think it's a lot of uh uh they think\nit's beautiful you know it's like oh I'd\nlove to do that\nuntil they sit in the seat\nand when you sit in the seat you\nunderstand real quick there's a lot of\npressure a lot of responsibility and the\none thing that each of you are called\nupon to do\nis to make is making decisions\nand that is a responsibility that you\nhave\nyou know the Bible says that God so\nloved the world\nthat he gave his only begotten son\nthat whosoever believes in Him should\nnot perish\nbut have everlasting life\nand Lisa and I were talking about that\nthis morning on the way in and we said\nisn't it really wonderful that we serve\na God that loves the whole world\ndoesn't matter what side of the aisle\nyou sit upon doesn't matter what race\nyou may be\nwe serve a God who loves you and we are\ncapable of loving one another because\nGod so loved us\nbut I understand that under in your\nsituation and even as a pastor for this\nmany years\nwe are called upon to make decisions and\nwhen we make those decisions how many of\nyou know not Everyone likes our decision\nthe moment we make them I heard a little\nstory it said you know to dwell below\nwith the Saints we know\nyou know oh I'm in order to dwell above\nwith the Saints we know won't that be\nglory but to work below with the people\nwe know that's another story\nit's not always easy and not everybody\nlikes our decisions and we get that\nbut I thought if I had one thing to say\nand basically when I came in they told\nme you have one thing to say and sit\ndown I said okay I agree\nthe word of God says and we know\nand we know this\nthat for those who love God\nall things work together for good\nfor those who are called according to\nGod's purpose\nthe promise is given to those who love\nGod\nthat God will take the decisions you\nmake\nand God will work them in our nation and\nGod will work them in our state\nboth Lise and myself have enjoyed living\nin Georgia our entire lives we went away\nto school for a few uh five years and\nthen return to Georgia and we were so\ngrateful to God to be back in the great\nstate\nand we we had to make decisions in our\nlife and so over the last 33 years we\nhave learned that some people are real\nexcited when we make them and some\npeople are really not excited at all\nand sometimes we think we're doing good\nand then sometimes we think I don't know\nif that's good or not and this is my\nquestion to you\nhow do you really know what's good\nand how do you really know what's bad\nwell I'm thankful that we have the word\nof God to measure our decisions by and\nwe certainly can consult the Lord and\nand I would say please for all of you in\nthis room\nwho are representing me and my family\nplease be prayerful please seek the\nwisdom of God I think God's smarter than\nall of us and I think we can lean on him\nand the Bible said if we acknowledge Him\nGod is faithful to direct our path and\nto help us make those decisions but as\nwell as we all know decisions are not\npopular with everyone but I heard a\nfriend he was trying to tell a story and\nhe said hey can I tell you a story about\na trip I took on a plane he goes man I'd\nlove to hear that story he said well I\nwas going to take a trip on a plane and\nit was my it's my first time to fly he\nsaid well that's good he said well\nhe said no it's not he said it was bad\nhe said because they had promised me to\ngo up with a pilot in the field and he\nwas going to take me up but he got sick\nand he wasn't able to take me out he\nsaid oh man that's bad he said no I said\nit was good he said because the pilot\nthat was got sick couldn't take me up\nand so he decided I'll find the best\npilot on the field to take my place and\nthat best pilot took me up he said oh\nman that's good you he said no actually\nit's bad he said because that guy was so\ngood he wanted to show out in that plane\nhe flew it straight up nose dived it\nback to the Earth flipped it over he\nsaid oh man that's bad he goes oh no he\nsaid it was good he said the most fun

got to that\nHaystack he said there was a\nfour-pointed pitch for it sticking right\nin the middle of that thing now I was\nheaded straight forward he said oh man\nthat's bad he said no sir he said that\nwas good he said actually he said I\nmissed that Pitchfork he said oh man\nthat's good he goes no man that's bad he\nsaid I miss that whole haystack\nand to sum up my five minutes and if I\nkept five minutes today I want a five\ndollar tip\nwe don't always know what's good and we\ndon't know what's bad and some of us\nhave gotten involved in things and\nthought it was good and lived long\nenough to find out oh that was bad\nand some of us have lived long enough to\nget involved in some things that weren't\nso good and to find out you know what\nisn't God good to be able to work out\nthings in our life that we could have\nnever worked out on our own\nthis morning when I came in I was\nlooking for uh Emery who's been a great\nfriend and I I'm not familiar with the\ncapital I'm not even familiar with what\nall you do other than we know you have\ngreat responsibility\nand I was praying Lord please help Lisa\nand I to find our way and we we were\nwalking through the streets and I\ncrossed the path of another\nrepresentative in the room Mr Chris\nIrwin and Chris and I used to be\nneighbors and I thought you know what\nGod knows how to direct our path to the\npeople we need to meet when we need to\nmeet them and they'll get us to where we\nneed to go\nand I just say to all of you\nwe love you and appreciate you\nGod loves you and wants a relationship\nwith you\nand if you'll trust him God will give\nyou wisdom to navigate every decision\nyou have to make and when they're made\nif you love God he is able to take\nthe little things that we do\nwork them all

to health of students in\nelementary and secondary education\nshall provide for the care of students\nbeing treated for epilepsy or a seizure\ndisorder this bill ever referred the\ncommittee on education that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nchair lady Dempsey is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ngood morning we've had a joy-filled\nmorning it's very important to pause now\nas we've been begin to go through these\nmeasures this first one I actually wore\nthe right color for today it's purple\nthis Sunday is being recognized in our\nstate\nas the the day for epilepsy awareness in\nthe state of Georgia\nI was so unaware of a lot of this and I\nactually have a husband who had a heat\nstroke running track in college which\nbrought on a seizure and those seizures\nreturned later in life he's on great\nmedicine and he stays very healthy\nbut there are actually 40 different\nforms of epilepsy as well as 25\ndifferent kinds of seizures some are\neasy to recognize some are not just like\nmany of the things we've done to have a\nprevention mode in our schools whether\nit is an allergy a reaction to a bee\npeanut butter anything else that can\nhelp a child and a parent feel safe it's\ntime for there to be an epilepsy plan\nfor each and every child that might be\ndiagnosed with that and that's what this\nis\napproximately 16 almost 17 000 children\nand teens live actively with epilepsy in\nGeorgia and Miss 11 or more days of\nschool in the past year is the average\nnumber that they miss because of this\ntrue challenge\nwe have an opportunity now with free\ntraining it's not only good for our\nteachers and the staff and everyone in\nthe schools but friends and each of us\nwho might suddenly find ourselves in\nthat situation it's free it's online\nthrough the epilepsy Alliance Foundation\nit takes about an hour to do with a\nbrief registration before it and\nafterwards a certificate is provided so\nwhat we're going to do is try to join 20\nother states that have passed this safe\nseizure law\nKentucky Indiana Texas Illinois New\nJersey Virginia Washington Oklahoma\nAlabama Colorado Nebraska Minnesota\nPennsylvania Utah Florida Maryland\nArizona Missouri Louisiana and\nCalifornia we cannot let them take\nbetter care of this situation than we\ncan it is imperative that we take care\nof each and every one of these young\npeople it requires that no later than\nAugust 1st of this year the Department\nof Education shall develop a model\nseizure action plan\nnot every school has a nurse those that\ndo that can be the person but if they\ndon't it's quite possible for other\nteachers other administrators others to\nbe aware and be prepared of the exact\nneed for that exact child some of our\nspecial needs children\nhave multiple seizures\nand very intense seizures but there are\nalso those that can go unnoticed but can\ncause severe complications if not\ntreated exactly correctly for that\nindividual child so I ask you to join me\ntoday in supporting this measure to help\nour children be safe and parents to feel\nsafe about having their children in a\nschool Mr Speaker I will take questions\nor

that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass\nchairman Lumsden is recognized to\npresent the bill\nMr Speaker members of the house I bring\nto you Senate Bill 65 which is a\nGovernor's bill\nthis bill is a one-page bill that does\nonly two things first it authorizes the\nCommissioner of Insurance to take the\nnecessary action to establish a\nstate-based Health Insurance Exchange to\nserve as the enrollment platform for\nindividuals to shop for and purchase\nhealth insurance in Georgia and secondly\nit strikes from code language that\nprohibits the state from establishing\nand operating a state-based health\nExchange\nMr Speaker that's the bill I'll be glad\nto appreciate your favorite\nconsideration gentlemen you ought to see\nor is he taking a question uh I'll take\na question\nrepresentative owl is recognized for a\nquestion to your right\nthank you does the gentleman yield are\nyou thank you I have two questions if\nthat's okay first question is as we're\nmoving to transition away from a\nfederally facilitated exchange on\nhealthcare.gov to a state based\nMarketplace what is going to be the\ntimeline for implementation of this\nprogram and how is the state prioritize\nfunds for uh marketing Outreach and\nconsumer advocacy as far as the timeline\nis concerned the insurance Commissioners\nI understand it has been working on this\nfor some time to get the program ready\nto go so it should be a fairly short uh\nprocess to get get the implementation\ngoing and a lot of the funding mechanism\nis um\nfrom\nthe monies that are paid to the\ncurrently that are going to support it\nat the federal level will be coming to\nthe state level\nokay one follow-up question if I may\nsure thank you if the gentleman further\nyields how will the state ensure that it\ndoes have a robust patient navigator\nsystem to reach first of all low income\nor uninsured patients and also to help\npeople who speak languages other than\nEnglish I'm just going to say I'm asking\nthis because I note that healthcare.gov\noffers resources for patient\nregistration in 15 languages and that\nGeorge is also becoming increasingly\nInternational so what programs right the\nNavigator program will remain it will\njust be answerable at the state level\ninstead of being answerable at the\nfederal level but The Navigators will\nstill be just as they are\nthank you\ngentlemen yield for another question or\ntwo one more question\nchair recognizes will park to your left\nright in front of you for a question\nwhat part thank you Mr Speaker does the\nchairman yield I do is it not true that\nthat this bill would create a\nstate-based exchange similar to about uh\n10 to 20 other states that have a\nstate-based exchange I think 17 other\nstates in DC already have implemented\nyet this yes does the general mean uh\nyield for one one additional question\nyes sir is it not true that this state\nbasic chain state-based exchange would\nhave to be subject to the protections\nfound under federal law that ensure that\nfor example all the qualified health\nbenefits are included and the plans that\nare on these exchanges and that also\nallows for flexibility absolutely we're\nstill Bound by all of the ACA\nregulations so yes this is just uh\ntransitioning from a federal program to\na state program which frankly if you've\ndealt with any federal programs you know\nthat they can be unwieldy and slow\nsometimes and we feel like we can be\nmore flexible and move quicker when\nthings need to be dealt with at the\nstate level than waiting on the feds to\ntake care of it thank you Mr Speaker\nI'll yield the well\ngentleman has yielded the well is there\nan objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered the chair has done the\nprevious question

that this bill do\npass\nchairman Petrie is recognized to present\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen in the house to bring you\ntoday Senate Bill 95 this bill deals\nwith the solid waste trust fund on your\ndesk you'll see a an audit that was done\nin 2015 of our uh of our Solid Waste\ntrust fund one of the primary\nrecommendations here was that we move\nour tire fee so when we established this\nin 1992 we established a one dollar fee\non all new tires sold in this state to\nhelp us with Tire pile cleanup all\nacross the state and many of you are\nquite aware as as uh I am of how many of\nthese piles are still out there all\nacross our state what we discovered is\nwe're only collecting about 80 percent\nof those funds because not all of our\nretailers are paying it and so one of\nthe primary recommendations that we move\nthat collection away from retailers\nabout 46 or so hundred of them in the\nstate to less than a hundred wholesalers\nand which are described in the bill as\nDistributors so this Bill very simply\nshifts that to Distributors rather than\nthe retailers all of your tire shops in\nyour community are going to love you for\nthis one and uh moreover we're going to\nincrease our collections dramatically\nprobably around two to three million\ndollars that are being left on the table\nthat we could use for these for these\ncleanup uh\nprojects uh one more thing in section\none you'll see we do add the governor\nwill add a new uh appointment to the\nrecycling Market Development Council and\nthat will be somebody to represent the\ntire industry that's very simple what\nthis uh very simply what this measure\ndoes Mr Speaker and I'm glad to answer\nany questions if there are any\ngentlemen yield for a question you have\na couple yes sir I yield\nrepresentative Wilkerson is recognized\nour question to your left in the back\nthank you Mr Speaker uh I guess looking\nat Lines 49 through 53\ncurrently\nthe retailers can deduct a certain\namount is that correct as far as I'm\nassuming that's for doing the reports\nthat's correct does that amount need to\nbe increased at some point because the\nDistributors are now collecting a\nsignificantly amount amount more because\nyou're having fewer Distributors going\nto collect more they're going to submit\nmore they're going to ask for more than\nthat three thousand\nyou know that issue was never addressed\nit wasn't as part of the recommendations\nin the audit and so we did not address\nthat so what you'll see representative\nthat language Remains the Same uh and is\nunchanged in this measure\ngentlemen yield\nrepresenting Chaz Cannon to your right\nhas a question\nMr speaker thank you do you yield no yes\nsir I yield is it not true that rural\ncounties such as the ones I represent\ndepend significantly on the distrust\nfund for our uh our our\nthe tires to have a collection to then\nget take them back to the state yes sir\nit's uh vital we uh these Tire piles are\neverywhere and and this material is\nuseful it's recycled and uh and has\ngreat reuse value so thank you sir thank\nyou for the question you have one more\nrepresentative yes sir Mr Speaker I'll\ntake one more\nright out to your left representative\nBennett\nthank you Mr Speaker would the gentleman\nyield yes ma'am am I to understand that\nthe one dollar would no longer be\num\naccepted taken or paid to the retailer\nis that yeah yeah no ma'am so the so the\none dollar fee will still be uh charged\nbut it will come from the distributor as\nthe bill describes it rather than the\nretailer so it's just a matter of uh\nwhere we're getting it at what point in\nthe in the process we're getting it from\nthe distributor again about a hundred\nfolks if you can think about the\nadvantage uh administratively rather\nthan trying to collect it from 45 4 600\nretailers we're collecting it from\naround 100 Distributors thank you but\nthe fee is unchanged the one dollar fee\nRemains the Same as it has since 1992.\nthank you Mr Speaker and I yield the\nwell gentlemen's yield of the well is\nany objection to the previous question\nbe in order the chair hears none the\nprevious question is ordered is there\nany objection to agreeing to the report\nof the committee which was favorable to\nthe passage of the bill the chair has\ndone the report of the committee

therefore\npassed Mr clerk will you read the\ncaption to Senate Bill\n129 129.\n129 by Senator Williams of the 25th and\nothers to be titled not to amend chapter\n2 of title 21 of the official go to\nGeorge Antonio relating to primaries and\nelections generally so to provide for\ntime off\nfor employees to advance vote this bill\nhaven't referred the committee on\ngovernmental Affairs that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute\na representative Leverett is recognized\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen I'm presenting to you today\nSenate bill 129. this is a bill filed by\na\nform a member of this body Senator Rick\nWilliams\nI was telling Rick whenever I\nsee members who were house members\nwho have now gone into the Senate I'm\nreminded of the man the words of the old\nman in A Christmas Story and one of the\ndream sequences where Ralphie imagines\nhaving gone blind because of the life\nboy punishment he got and his old man\nsays what has brought you to this lowly\nstate\nso anyway we've got a number of alums\nover there but Rick is doing a good job\nthis is a bill actually it's it the the\nessential and original component of the\nbill is section three that was a bill\nactually that was filed in this chamber\nlast year Bob representative Hagin that\nwould expand the existing Protections in\nGeorgia law that allow people to take\ntime off on Election Day to vote the the\nstatute has not been amended since we\nadopted early voting it still just\naddresses election day so we are\nexpanding that protection to also extend\nto to our employees can take up to two\nhours to vote on a early voting day they\nhave to notify the employer and the\nemployer can designate the actual time\nthey take off but it does allow people\nto to have that time off if they need it\nto vote on an early voting day so that's\na bill that passed out of this house I\nthink almost unanimously last year and I\nwould encourage you to vote favorably\nfor the bill again this year because\nbecause it contains that plus some other\nsections which are and I use this word\nin the well but largely cleanup that was\nrequested by the Secretary of State\nspecifically just to walk through those\nquickly section one that has to do with\nthe uh performance review boards there's\na provision that allows the appointment\nof local election officials to those\nboards that has arguably been construed\nto refer to an entire Board of Elections\nand registration so you'd have to\nappoint the entire board we're just\namending that to make it clear that\nspecific board members can be appointed\nin section two we're changing the text\nof the disclaimer that has to go out it\nhas to appear prominently on a ballot\napplication where the the initial\nlanguage I think was in an earlier\nversion of 202 when it was moving\nthrough the process and there were later\nsome changes made to that section and\nthe disclaimer is more consistent with\nthe laws actually passed section three\nis the original bill from the Senate\nsection four has to do with the reports\nthat the local election superintendents\nhave to generate on the day of the\nelection as to what they're supposed to\nfile a report currently by 10 o'clock as\nto what ballots they've counted and what\nbalance still remain problem with that\nis of course that's the exact time\nthey're you know assiduously trying to\nget the ballots counted so we push that\ntime back to 11 59 and then the final\nsection we're just trying to clear up\nsome of the processes on Audits and make\nit clear that auditing can also occur on\nprimaries and other elections as well as\ngeneral elections uh Mr Speaker that's\nthat's the uh the gist of the bill and\nI'm glad to stand for any questions\nyou have no questions but we do have\nanother speaker on the bill\nthank you ladies and gentlemen I will\nyield the well and ask your favorable\nconsideration of Senate bill 129.\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresenting Bernal is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthis bill is an improvement however the\nintention to modify or eliminate risk\nlimiting audit procedures could be an\nunintended consequence of creating a\nlack of Integrity in Georgia's elections\na risk limited audit can tell us to the\nhighest level of certainty that the\nannounced election outcome is correct if\nthere is a problem with the machine\ncounting a risk limiting audit can catch\nand correct the problem if potential\nhigh-stakes sampling of the Statewide\ncontest is needed a risk limited audit\nof the Fail-Safe method is the Fail-Safe\nmethod to collect the accurate sample\nsize Georgia used the risk limited audit\nmethod to reconcile the 2020\npresidential election\nthis bill would also be more acceptable\nif we could add at least 10 drop boxes\nto each County because we all don't have\nmailboxes at the end of our driveways\nand we have constituents that work\ndifferent shifts and need more\nflexibility thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nthe will\nthe lady has yielded the well is there\nany objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered that Jerry has done the\nprevious questions ordered is there any\nobjection to adopting the committee's\nsubstitute the chair has done the\ncommittee's substitute is adopted he is\nin objection to agreeing to the report\nof the committee which was favorable to\nthe passage of the bill the chair he has\ndone the report of the committee is\nagreed to shall this bill now pass all\nin favor of the passage of the bill\nwe'll vote Yes all those opposed will\nvote no and the clerk will unlock the\nmachine\nhave all members voted\nhave all members voted if so the clerk\nwill lock the machine on the passage of\nthe bill the yeas were 161 denays nine\nthe bill haven't received a requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed\ntrue\nMr Clark will you read the caption to\nSenate bill 204-204\nSenate Bill 204 by representative Donald\nthe 27th and others to be entitled an\nact to amend chapter 14 Title 20 the\nofficial quoted George annotated related\neducation accountability so to provide\nfor the recognition of certain\naccrediting agencies as evaluators\nevaluators of the quality of Education\noffered in public schools in this state\nthis bill ever refer to the committee on\neducation that committee recommends that\nthis bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute\nthe lady from the 36th house District\nrepresentative Judy Earhart is\nrecognized to present the Bill thank you\nMr Speaker members I present to you SB\n204 which addresses the issue of\naccreditation of our K-12 Public School\nSystems the organizations that accredit\nour public schools are private agencies\nthey are funded by our tax dollars by\nway of our school districts these\nprivate accrediting agencies are\nindependent unelected bodies that have\nno oversight from the State Board of\nEducation or the general assembly\nthey have no accountability to any\nelected body or state agency in Georgia\nthey are in a word unregulated\nby their own declaration they are not\nsubject to open records requests they\nhave no allowance for due process and\noffer no independent appeals process\nshould a public school system disagree\nwith the findings of the accreditation\nreview\nadditionally in just the past three\nyears they have entered into the\nbusiness practice of selling Improvement\nservices to the same school districts\nthey accredit typically based on the\nfindings of their review\ncurrently in Georgia there is nothing in\ncode that offers any oversight to these\naccrediting agencies so why is this all\ncode concerning\nbecause eligibility for the Hope\nScholarship requires that our high\nschool seniors graduate from an\naccredited high school so without\naccreditation they are not eligible so\nessentially we have an unelected\nunaccountable private entity with the\npower to Grant downgrade or remove\naccreditation or threaten to do so and\naffect the affect our students\neligibility for hope\nhb506 seeks to address these concerns by\nproviding some guidance and guard rails\nto this taxpayer-funded accreditation\nprocess so that Georgia doesn't abdicate\nsomething as important as Hope\nScholarship eligibility to a private\nentity the bill creates a new article in\ncode that does the following it defines\nwhat a recognized accrediting agency is\nit sets forth that the State Board of\nEducation shall establish accreditation\ncriteria\nbased 65 percent on the academic quality\nof the school district meaning uh\nmeaning but not including but not\nlimited to student achievement closure\nof student achievement Gap and student\nprogress 35 of the accreditation\ncriteria would be based on the financial\nefficiency of the school district and\nhow state and federal funds are being\nused by the district to impact student\nachievement\nit also provides for a due process that\nmeans a hearing a right to appeal a\nright for the school district to be\nrepresented by Council if needed\nit prohibits the agency from selling any\nservices or materials to the school\ndistrict that are intended to address\nany deficiencies they find so thereby\neliminating the conflict of interest\nthat currently exists it provides for\ncompliance with open records right the\nagency must give full disclosure to the\nschool system of any complaint that\nwarrants a special review\nit allows the state Boe to determine if\nthey are complying and most importantly\nit provides for an appeals process for\nyour school districts\nthrough the creation of an accreditation\ncommittee through the Boe in case\nthere's a dispute between the school and\nthe crediting agency allows them to find\neither through mediation through\ncompromise to find a solution to any\ndisagreement that the school district\nmay have with the accreditation agency's\nfindings and that is what hb506 does it\npassed unanimously out of out of uh our\neducation committee I asked for your\nfavorable support Mr Speaker I'll yield\nfor any questions if there are any\nyou have a couple to your left chairman\nParsons to your immediate left-handed\nquestion gentleman's recognized for a\nquestion thank you speaker the lady\nyield I will\nI wanted to ask I see the\nSenate Bill 206 is sponsored in the\nSenate by the gentleman from the 27th\nover there\nand I just wanted to ask is this Senate\nBill 207 204 rather the language on this\nbill substantially the language and a\nbill that I know that you have worked on\nit is thank you unfortunately my bill\njust didn't quite make it across on\ncrossover but Senator de la Zell was\ncertainly\nwilling to incorporate some of the\nlanguage in mind it provided I believe\nhis originally did not allow for an\nappeals process so we added that to his\nbill it is essentially the bill that I\ncarried very good thank you for your\nhard work on this thank you\nrepresentative Doreen Carter to your\nextreme left back here is recognized for\na question thank you Mr Speaker this is\ngentle lady yield yes would you clarify\nfor me the language that states that the\naccrediting agency cannot offer services\nfor a cost but are they also prohibited\nfrom uh providing a service if there's\nno additional cost right thank you Frank\nwith that question does not prohibit\nthem from providing uh\nservice if there is no additional cost\nit simply eliminates the ability of them\nto go in and diagnose the problem and\nthen sell the school district a solution\nto that problem it also doesn't prohibit\nthem from offering or selling services\nthat address issues that were not found\nas part of a deficiency in the school\ndistrict I do remember that was a\nconcern that you had and I hope that's\nbeen sufficiently addressed that's a\ngeneral lady yes you so it does and\nthank you for that but I would like\nappointed Clarity that it did not leave\nthe committee uh with full support\nbecause I did vote against it but I will\nbe voting for it on the floor today\nthank you for that thank you\nlady year for one more one more question\nrepresentative Lisa Campbell to your\nleft has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield yes and my Cobb or my Acworth\nneighbor\nmy question is well I'm excited to\naffirm your stance advocating for\naccountability in our Educational\nSystems I'm curious on for Point C1 on\npage six an accrediting agency shall not\napply any standards measures or\nevaluation criteria and not in\ncompliance with state law could you just\nhelp me understand the types of criteria\nthat would be found in that law that\nwould be anything that that this body\nhas previously passed or anything that\nis currently exists in state laws that\nwe are making sure that whatever\nstandards we're using to accredit those\nagency don't step outside of what is\ncurrently allowed in state law and would\nyou allow for yield for one more\nquestion do those um\ndo those standards evaluations and\ncriteria currently exist in state law\ndo the standards exist there are\ncurrently there is nothing in code that\naddresses accreditation in the state of\nGeorgia the only reference to\naccreditation now is as it relates to\nthe Hope Scholarship so there are no and\nthat's really one of the reasons for the\nlegislation there currently is no\nstandard in code that establishes any\nparameters for accreditation criteria\nand would you yield for one's further\nfollowing question last one\nif the entire point of this bill\nis to review\nstandards measures and to evaluate our\nschools\nand the premise is that the\naccreditating agency will follow state\nlaw but that law does not exist\nhow will we rationalize that in\nsupporting this bill not quite sure I\nunderstand the question however I can\ntell you that that is certainly not the\nonly purpose for the bill\num this is essentially an unregulated uh\narea of educational purview uh the\npurpose of the bill is both to set\nparameters saying look everything that\nwe're using to comply needs to either be\nbased on the academic achievement of the\nschool district or the financial\nresponsibility of the school district\nthat's it all the other things as well\nit does a lot of other really great\nthings for our school district by\nempowering them to have a say at the\ntable let's say they don't agree with\ntheir with their review through the due\nprocess and the appeals process and\neliminating the conflict of interest\nthat I mentioned earlier thank you for\nyour questions\nMr Speaker if there no further questions\nI'll yield The Well the lady has yielded\nthe well is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered the\nchair here has known the previous\nquestion is ordered is there any\nobjection to adopting the committee's\nsubstitute the chair has none The\ncommittee's Substitute is adopted he\nused any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nthat Jerry has done the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to shall this bill\nnow pass all in favor of the passage of\nthe bill we'll vote Yes all those\nopposed will vote no and the clerk will\nunlock the machine\nhave all members voted\nfor what purpose does representing may\nnot rise\nparliamentary inquiry the state inquiry\nis it not true Mr Speaker that over the\nsummer I was privileged to be on the\naccrediting\num special study committee with the\neducation\ncommittee and it was found that schools\nthroughout the state of Georgia are\nbeing accredited by an organization that\nhas no oversight whatsoever and is it\nnot further true Mr Speaker\nthat if an accrediting body has no\noversight and they're making up their\nown rules to accredit a school that this\nbill will help provide more oversight\nfor the schools so they are not spending\nso much money on accrediting Services\nbecause there is no oversight of the\naccrediting agency\nis that not true\nmakes sense to me sounds I know the\ngeneral lady believes what she sow\nStates and is certainly informed\nall members voted if so the clerk will\nlock the machine\non the passage of the bill the yeas were\n161 the

on Health Net committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nchairman Newton is recognized to present\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'll be brief this\nis a transparency Bill and it relates to\nhaving patients better understand the\nvaried professionals that they interact\nwith when they receive Health Care it\ndoes this by having the provider be\nclear about their area of training both\nverbally and in advertising we all know\nreceiving Health Care can be a complex\nand often confusing process especially\nat a time when a loved one or family\nmember is ill or injured there's many\nSpecialties there's lots of different\nareas of expertise Physical Therapy\nnutrition and others\nwe've discussed numerous times that it\ndoes take this team of professionals to\nprovide this care it turns out more and\nmore though are also getting Master's\nlevel degrees or sometimes even\ndoctorates which occasionally can be\nconfusing with patients if they're not\nsure exactly who they're overseeing\ndoctor is this bill does help by making\nsure that everyone's clear about their\ntheir level of training it makes sure\nthat the patient will be informed of the\nfield and the level of training that the\nprovider holds does also as I said\napplies to advertising\nthere's so many varied procedures and\nindividuals involved I recently had a\nfamily member who was hospitalized with\na with a fracture and even with one of\nthe family members in the room with\nalmost all the time it can be a very\nconfusing situation when multiple people\nand Consultants are coming into the\nrooms you've got teams of of surgeons\nand PAs that work together nurse\npractitioners that work together it can\njust be a very confusing time even in\nthe best of situations I think HB 197\nI'm

this\nbill having been referred to the\nCommittee on Public Health that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass\nfor for informational purposes before\nchairman Jones presents the bill we do\nhave a number of folks who have signed\nup to speak and we have a Minority\nReport chairman Todd Jones is recognized\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ngood afternoon colleagues welcome back\nfrom lunch\num I have the privilege of carrying\nSenate Bill won by Senator dullesal\nSenate bill one is a simple bill\nit extends in perpetuity the current law\nas it relates to the covid-19\nvaccination status by removing the\nsunset clause on line 40 of the bill\nthat's all this bill does the current\nlaw prevents government and all of its\nsubdivisions agencies and authorities\nfrom discriminating against citizens and\ndenying Services based on coveted\nvaccination status Mr Speaker that is\nthe extent of the bill and I'll yield\nfor questions\nyield for a question yes sir\nto your left representative Park Cannon\nis recognized for a question thank you\nMr Speaker do you yield\nyes representative\nit's the kobit 19 pandemic over\nrepresentative Park from everything that\nI have read and based on the knowledge\nthat I have received from studying the\ndata I would indicate to you that I\nbelieve that it is we've also heard that\nfrom certain parts of Washington but at\nthe end of the day this is not a bill on\nwhether or not the pandemic is over or\nwhether or not it's still ongoing but\nrather this is a bill that says we are\nnot going to allow the state its\nagencies or its subdivisions or\nauthorities to discriminate against any\nGeorgia citizen for services that they\nare due\nand a follow-up question do you yield uh\nyes representative\nthank you for that answer and so for\nthose who are differently abled or maybe\nhandicapped or more sensitive to\ninfectious disease how does this bill\nimpact their livelihood well I can't\nspeak for all 10.7 million Georgians\nother than the fact that I believe in\ntheir freedom and their Liberty I expect\nthem to take all the proper precautions\njust like they did before 2020 and I'm\nsure they will continue to do that and\nfrankly I encourage them to do that\ngentlemen yield for one more yes sir\nrepresentative Roman straight out in\nfront of you hi does the gentleman yield\nyes thank you um it's kind of a two-part\nquestion does this how does this impact\nprivate entities\nthis does not impact private entities at\nall at all so but with their um with\ntheir contracts be in any way shape or\nform\num impacted if they do require a coveted\nvaccine for their employees but they do\nwork for the state\nwhat a private company does in a private\norganization does is basically a\ncontract amongst themselves and we\nencourage that okay thank you\ngentleman has one more question that\npopped up chairman sayings to your left\nhas a question does the gentleman yield\nyes sir is it not true that the CDC\nmarked this pandemic over while this\nprotection was in place and Georgia\nCitizens had this right that is true as\nI reference we have seen Washington and\nits Affiliates some of them say that and\nin fact you are correct\ngentleman has no further questions thank\nyou Mr Speaker I yielded well and I\nasked for your favorable consideration\non sb1\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nwe will now have up to 30 minutes for\nthose to speak to the bill that are\nopposed\nrepresentative Al is represented for\na presentation\nrepresentative\nthe clown knows fell off\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI Rise to speak in opposition to sb1 and\nI have to say that speaking against this\nbill really feels like deja vu all over\nagain because I remember when this bill\nwas heard last year on the Senate side\nback when it was called SB 345\nso this bill aims to eliminate the\nability for government agencies\nincluding public schools to require\ncoveted vaccination quote as a condition\nof providing any service or access to\nany facility\nso while it's important to note that no\nGeorgia public schools at present\nrequire the coveted vaccine for\nattendance the harm posed by bills like\nthis are not abstract\nso first while we know much more about\ncovid-19 at this point in the pandemic\nwe cannot anticipate future events\nvariants or public health needs\nbills like this tie our hands with\nrespect to the response we can provide\nand it limits our toolbox whether we\nthink we need the tools at present or\nnot\nso last year when this bill was called\nSB 345 Senate Republicans in the HHS\ncommittee my good friends and colleagues\nadded two amendments both of which we\ncan see in the text of this bill as it\nstands right now\nthe First Amendment we can see in lines\n35-39 this was added by Senator Chuck\nhuffstetler and this made sure that we\ndidn't ban hospitals and Health Systems\nfrom requiring coveted vaccination of\ntheir patient-facing employees because\nthat would be uh\nthat would run afoul of CMS requirements\nfor entities that care for Medicare and\nMedicaid patients\nand I think we can agree this is a good\nAmendment\nas generally speaking it's good to not\nwrite bills that violate federal law\nthe second amendment was also a good one\nproposed by Senator Dr Dean Burke\nwhich you can see in line 40. this\namendment proposed a one-year sunset\nprovision on the prohibition of covid\nvaccine requirements\nSenator Burke of course is no longer\nserving in the Senate because he has\nbeen appointed to be the chief medical\nofficer at the Department of Community\nHealth\nhis reasoning for the sunset provision\nat the time was that it minimized the\neffect of SB 345 because we should not\ntie our own hands when it comes to the\nability to respond to Future Public\nHealth crises\nsb1 now eliminates the sunset provision\nexpanding the potential for this\nlimitation indefinitely\nso beyond the specifics bills like this\nseeking to undermine the coveted vaccine\nhave the effect in fact of undermining\nconfidence in all vaccines including\nthose for polio the measles the\nchickenpox bacterial meningitis the list\ngoes on\nand whether this was the intended\nconsequence or not\nthis rise in vaccine hesitancy supported\nin part by state governmental efforts to\nundermine trust in public health is in\nfact what we have seen here in Georgia\nand nationally in the past few years\nin other words we've seen how even a\nlimited version of sb1 passed last year\nis already inflicting demonstrable and\nLasting harm\nand we've seen\nthe way that doubt and cynicism\nmisinformation\nand the undermining of confidence in\npublic institutions has caused cracks in\nthe foundational elements keeping our\nsociety safe\nand indeed free\nwe have a responsibility\nin this body because what we say here\nmatters I think we would all agree on\nthat since we serve in this body and\nwhat we legitimize in our discourse what\nissues we focus on in this chamber what\nwe write into law this all matters right\nbecause for good or for bad people\nare listening to us\nwhether explicitly or not bills like\nthis give oxygen to the idea that people\nshould be skeptical of the demonstrated\nsafety and efficacy of a vital public\nhealth tool that here in the state of\nGeorgia is still vastly underutilized\nfurther this bill limits the Department\nof Public Health from having all options\nat its disposal to do the often\nimpossible job we ask of them day after\nday\nthis bill is not about our current\nenvironment or the current state of the\ncovid pandemic which is ongoing\nor what we need to require or prohibit\nright now\nthis bill is about limiting our ability\nto respond in the future\nto circumstances we may not currently be\nable to anticipate\nso one point I need to make here is that\npandemics work very quickly we saw that\nthree years ago\nthis legislature as we can see Works\nquite slowly\nthis is why we should not write limits\nto our pandemic response into law the\nsame reason that I don't lay out my kids\nclothes two weeks in advance because I\ncannot possibly anticipate what the\nweather is going to look like\nso I recognize that one of the easiest\nthings to do in this chamber is to stand\nup here and talk and talk and talk and\ntalk right I recognize however also that\none of the hardest things to do in this\nchamber is to persuade people\nbut I Ask of my colleagues to please\nplease please think critically on this\nissue and view this not through a\npartisan lens\nand simply consider that it should not\nbe the role of this legislature again to\ndictate what public health tools can be\nat our disposal even if we don't want to\nuse them right now\ndon't burn your Bridges\nand maybe more importantly than that do\nnot give people the impression that\nBridges cannot be trusted\nmore than any one bill\nmore than just this bill what we say\nhere\nmatters\nso consider what you say with your vote\ntoday and please vote no on sb1 this\nbill that undermines Public Health\nthank you I will do well\nlady has yielded well\nrepresentative Hutchinson is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nwe're tired of kobit we're all tired of\ncovid I'm tired of covid\nI really wish covid was not a part of\nour everyday lives but unfortunately it\nstill is\nwe still have people who wear masks\nwe're not mandated to wear masks but\nsome people have compromised immune\nsystems\nor whatever personal reason they decided\nthey want to wear masks because they\nmight be afraid of covid\nyou know\nwe're not losing 200 people a day like\nwe were during the height of covet\nbut Georgia has lost over 40 000 people\nto covet and over a million across this\ncountry\nI want to digress a minute I'm a social\nworker\nprior to my election in 2018\num we have a lot of new people prior to\nmy election I did not hang out at the\nCapitol I did not know\nthe intricacies of what\npeople or party can pass what or chair\nwhat or when I first got here\nI was I am from New Orleans for the new\npeople my husband's from Georgia\nwe decided while we were dating that we\ncould not talk about any form of\nfootball whatsoever not College not\nprofessional nothing so when Atlanta\nUnited that announced that they were\nhaving a professional soccer team\nwe signed up for season tickets before\nthere was even a name so I have four\nAtlanta United super fans at my house\nwhen I was running somebody asked what's\nthe first thing you're going to do on\nyour first day of office and I said\nprobably not much but I will start\nAtlanta United day\nI was elected in November 2018.\nthey won the MLS Cup in December of\n2018. so when I was sworn in in January\nthat Atlanta United day was already\nstarted so I joined reached across the\naisle joined the effort\nand the person I was working with in the\nhouse said I don't like license plates\nso when the Atlanta United license plate\nBill comes I want you to carry it\nI didn't know any better that was\nprobably my first week as a freshman\nhere but I was very excited\nuntil the lobbyists called me out the\nday before the boat to say he made the\nexecutive decision that a freshman from\nthe minority party could not pass a\nlicense plate bill\nthat was my first lesson here about what\nI could and could not do so I've been\nwatching\nand things that I thought before I came\nhere\njust didn't turn out to be\nsuch as\nmedical autonomy\nI kind of thought that was a one-sided\nthing\nI kind of thought that we only talked\nabout medical autonomy when we were\ntalking about Reproductive Rights but\nthen I learned by watching the debates\nabout masks and vaccines that these are\nvery personal medical decisions that\npeople make\nwith their Doctors Without The\ninterference of government\nparental rights\nbut most importance\nwhen we're talking about vaccines when\nwe're talking about making decisions for\nchildren\nbut there were also times like trans\nbills where parents have no rights\nI thought local control was a huge thing\nuntil redistricting\nand local bills were hijacked\nand that's why I am confused about this\nbill\nsomebody I'm sure\nI'm truly confused when does local\ncontrol matter\nbecause I represent Snellville if the\nnext bird flu or raccoon flu or\ncoyote flu hits Snellville\nif this passes it will limit what we can\ndo to protect my constituents from\nraccoon flu\nand believe me I have a lot of raccoons\nin my yard so I am concerned about\nraccoon blue but if this bill passes\nwill Snellville have\nthe authority\nto control what happens in Snellville so\nthat we don't spread raccoon flu\nreading this bill I don't think so\nwhen covid first when first broke out\nand even after and even now we were\ncriticized as a country that we did not\nhave a safety plan we didn't have a\nbackup plan if something like covet hit\nthe planet which it did\nI feel like sb1 is sending us back into\nthe unknown\nif we don't have the ability at the\nmunicipality where these things are\ncoming out\nhow will we control for the next\noutbreak\nand that is my concern\nso I'm asking you for the sake of\nraccoon flu or coyote flu or whatever\nflu comes up next year\nlet's vote no on sb1 and keep local\ncontrol where it belongs thank you Mr\nSpeaker you're the well\nlady has yielded the well\nrepresent your nullowitz\nis recognized to speak to the bill\nrepresent vanilla Woods thank you thank\nyou Mr Speaker I actually prefer the\nterm trash Panda but that's not what my\nspeech is about I actually rise before\nyou today to share my concerns with sb1\nwe know and we have the data that proves\nto us that the vaccine rate for routine\nchildhood immunizations has decreased in\nGeorgia measles bacterial meningitis\npolio the rates for all of these\nchildhood vaccines has declined in\nGeorgia these are completely preventable\ndiseases and they have devastating\nconsequences for the children and adults\nwho contract these diseases or even if\nthey are simply exposed to these\ndiseases for example if an unvaccinated\nchild exposes their teacher to measles\nand if their teacher is expecting a\nchild\nthe consequences for that unborn child\nare potentially lethal\nin Cobb County where I'm from\ncovid wasn't actually the first time\nstudents had to miss school because of\nan outbreak\nin the fall of 2019 in fact there was a\nmeasles outbreak in a middle school in\nCobb County that kept almost two dozen\nstudents out of school\nfor several weeks alarmingly and this is\nthis is what really disturbs me this\noutbreak this measles outbreak was never\neven reported to Public Health officials\nthey happened to learn it when they were\nwhen they were trying to trace what\ncould have happened with an outbreak\nthat began in Florida and they realized\nit was in Georgia and then they realized\nthat kids had had the measles and nobody\nhad told the Department of Public Health\nthat is deeply concerning\nthe root of this outbreak was parents\nwho I think\nsincerely believed they were acting in\nthe best interest of their children by\nnot vaccinating them\nbut these parents were in all likelihood\nmaking these decisions based on a stream\nof misinformation that is perpetually\nchurned from a fire hose held by those\nwho the reality is stand to make a whole\nlot of money out of this industry of\nvaccine disinformation\nI have spent years now\nin my role as a House member immersed in\nthe world of anti-vaccine misinformation\nand I'm telling you there is a lot of\nmoney that a lot of folks are making so\nthey they it is to their economic\nbenefit that they have policies like\nthis like sb1 that we're discussing\ntoday because it continues to erode that\nfaith in vaccines I am an advocate for\nvaccines because I am so aware of how\ncritical these vaccines are to the\nhealth of all Georgians and by extension\nto our economy\nif we learned anything from the pandemic\nand we learned a lot I hope it's that a\nhealthy Workforce is critical to every\nbusiness in Georgia thus I am baffled\nthat any employer wouldn't encourage\ntheir employees to be vaccinated against\nany illness as well as their families\nbecause we also know when your kids are\nsick your employee isn't able to come to\nwork\nit's troubling then to hear elected\nofficials who purport to want a strong\nvibrant healthy Georgia for our\nindividual Georgians and for our economy\nto be talking about policies that do\nundermine that faith in vaccines we know\nthat discussions like those behind sb1\ndo erode public faith and vaccines there\nis data on this also a lot of scientists\nhave been studying this we've had a\npretty large sample size for the past\nfew years\nwe know that the potential consequences\nof this anti-vaccine anti-science\nrhetoric is incalculable\nyet we continue with these discussions\nbecause all of us in this room hear from\na handful of activists who continue to\nperpetuate this pervasive culture of\nmisinformation I know that the cohort of\nfolks that emails me about any\nlegislation having to do with vaccines\nanything the past few years having to do\nwith the pandemic the same parents who\nwanted parental Authority you all know\nthat term the same parents who wanted\nparental authority to you know choose\nwhether they can have their children\nvaccinated to choose whether their\nchildren have a you know Mass the ones\nwho send me information from these\norganizations that are making a lot of\nmoney spreading vaccine misinformation\nit's the same folks who emailed me when\nthey loved this bill I always know when\nI need to be on the lookout for a\nvaccine bill because I start to get\nemails from the same group of folks and\nI'm sure y'all also have similar cohorts\nof parents again I do believe they love\ntheir children intensely and they think\nthey're doing the right thing I also\nknow that they have been misled\nequally concerning is the rise of\nsimilar sentiments that aren't just\nanti-science they're not just\nanti-vaccine but they're anti-scientist\nthey're anti-scientist Georgia is home\nto the CDC it makes me heart sick and\ncontinues to have made me heartsick over\nthe years to see people who I know and\notherwise respect saying the most awful\nthings about the CDC because you know\nwhat it really is and I've told this to\nmy friends and family who live out of\nstate who would say things about the CDC\nor maybe say some conspiracy I'm like do\nyou understand that in Atlanta these\naren't just a bunch of really smart\nscientists they're our neighbors they're\nmembers of our community they're the\npeople that our kids play soccer with\nthey're the people who are behind line\nat the at the Publix or the people who\nwere going to cheer for the Atlanta\nUnited with or maybe the Saints who\nknows your mileage may vary\nwanted to make sure y'all are listening\nwho dat\nthese CDC scientists are not only the\nexperts in our fields in their fields\nnot my field their field\nI'm really good at talking\nthese CDC scientists are not only the\nexperts in their fields but they are our\nneighbors right we know them we know\nthey're not part of some kind of\nconspiracy we know they're not part of\nany nefarious plot they're just trying\nto do the work that they have been\ntrained to do\nfrankly I think that these scientists at\nthe CDC are patriots again it bothers me\ngreatly to know that we are having\npolicy discussions that one way or\nanother undermine the work of these\nAmericans who are working to keep us\nsafe and alive and healthy and they're\ndoing it right here in our backyard\nI'm grateful for their work I'm grateful\nfor the work of all of the public health\nemployees who continue to plod ahead\nthrough the morass of disinformation and\npublic policy proposals that serve only\nto undermine their life's work\nI urge you to vote against this bill I\nurge you to support our Public Health\nofficials I urge you to support vaccines\nin Georgia I yield the well\nrepresentative drenner is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nI got 12 minutes worth of information\nI got nine pages here to talk about\njust so you all know I spent the last\nthree years\ndreaming about the day that I would get\nto come down here and talk about covet\nagain\nright every one of us in this chamber\nhas been impacted by covid\nfirst\nwhere you live during a pandemic matters\nsecond how old you are during a pandemic\nmatters third what you do for a living\nduring a pandemic matters\nand fourth who is running your response\nmatters\nso demographics geography social status\nparty affiliation and federal state\nrelationships matter during a pandemic\nthe federal response to covid was to\navoid a national strategy on what was a\nnational problem\nthat put Americans reaction apart from\nthe rest of the world\nthere was a different response in every\nstate\nand no other country was the level of\nfriction between National and\nsub-national governments as high as it\nwas in the United States\neverybody's sleeping now in the back\nremember I have 11 more minutes to go\nthank you Karen\nthese decisions shaped two basic\npatterns first the decisions that each\nstate were not just reactions to the\nvirus but were embedded in a far longer\nand much wider policy stream\nsecond these decisions are clustered in\nimportant ways with groups of States\nfollowing different tactics\nthere were many arguments for allowing\nthe states to take the lead to begin\nwith the virus did not flare up\nuniformly\nas the disease developed they had\nsurprising patterns hitting both urban\nareas and Rural hot spots you may recall\nthat it hit food processing plants here\nin Georgia\nso crafting a single strategy proved\nextraordinarily difficult\nmost notably in the early weeks of the\ncrisis the lockdown decision was the\ncentral\npublic policy action\nthe pivotal question was whether the\nlockdown decisions followed the\nseriousness of the outbreak\nsadly the death rate provided the best\nevidence of the severity of the disease\nand it was the most uniform National\nmeasure even though reporting problems\nmade even this measure hard to collect\nthe timing of the governor's decisions\nwas not directly connected with the\nseriousness\nof their problems\nthe pattern of State responses showed\nthat the lockdown in March\nvoted for President Trump at a much\nlower rate and tended to have a weaker\nRepublican control of their state\ngovernments\nthe decision to lock down was also\nconsisted with a broad collection of\ndisparate policy decisions over a long\ntime for example consider the connection\nbetween a Governor's lockdown decisions\nin a state previous decision to expand\nMedicaid as a part of the Affordable\nCare Act\nin the states that did not lock down in\nMarch almost two-thirds had to decided\nnot to expand Medicaid\nthere were also Stark differences in the\nstate's investment in their public\nhealth programs\nthe outbreak of coved has laid beer a\ntrio of fundamentally essential issues\nthe first is the relationship between\nthe federal government and the states\nthe relation among the states and what\nis at the point here today is the\nrelationship between the states and\ntheir localities\nin Georgia\nthe frictions between the state and the\nlocal governments boiled over with\nFierce battles over who had the\nauthority to set the rules for Citizens\nwhich businesses could stay open and\nunder what circumstances\nthis intergovernmental confusion meant\nthat it was impossible to get an\naccurate picture of the disease it\nspread and its Health implications\nin fact The Benchmark data for tracking\ncoved increasingly came not from\ngovernment sources but instead from\nprivate and non-profit organizations\nincluding a collaborative of media\norganizations that created their own\ncovid tracking project\nnow I know at this point all of you are\nlike why is she continuing to go on\nright\nI heard you penny\nI'm going on because the most enduring\nquestions that has emerged from this\ncovet outbreak is whether governments in\nthe United States failed\nor at least did not succeed As Americans\nneeded it to precisely because it relied\nso heavily on the states as Laboratories\nwhich produce such wide-ranging\nexperiments\nthe questions you should be asking is\ndid some states develop strategies that\ngiven the problems they face produce\nsignificantly better outcomes\ndid frictions in the system between\nWashington and some states between many\nstates and between some states capitals\nand their local governments create much\nhigher risk and cost more lives\nthese questions require us to sustain\nand examine because it's impossible to\nescape the conclusion that the country's\ninitial response was successfully\nless so than other countries\nits response in turn weakened The\npublic's trust and widened political\npolarization at precisely the time\nthat citizens and Business Leaders\nstruggled to determine who to believe\nthat's really what's at issue today in\nsb1 is who do we believe\nwe are preempting local governments\nagain today was DeKalb day\nDeKalb was one of the first counties in\nthe state\nto shut down\nto issue a mask mandate\nwhich was taken\nat issue by the state\npreempting local governments\nfrom reacting to a pandemic\nis the least efficient way to control a\npandemic\nI would encourage you I know everybody\nwants to go I probably have what five\nmore minutes left\nI'm thinking about maybe singing a song\nin all seriousness\nthe pandemic was probably the most\nserious\ncrisis our country faced\nand continues to face in eliminating\nlocal control is not the way to move\nforward I ask you to vote no for sb1\nthank you Mr Speaker I'm gonna go sit\ndown now\nthe lady has wisely yielded the wealth\nis there an objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair has\ndone the previous question is ordered we\ndo have a Minority Report\nfor up to 20 minutes\nrepresenting Ann Allen Westbrook is\nrecognized for\nthe first part of The Minority Report\nrepresentative you will not control the\ntime on the Minority Report\nthank you Mr Speaker and good afternoon\ncolleagues I Rise to speak against sb1\nbecause it taints what should be a\nstraightforward Public Health measure\nwith partisan politics and it needlessly\nputs Georgians at risk for preventable\nillness\nwe know that covid-19 has been\nunfortunately politicized in a way that\nother diseases have not been and that\nwas a conscious Choice made by political\nleaders People Like Us\npeople in this body national leaders\nAmplified by I would argue some of the\nless reputable media outlets in our\ncountry also played a part in that and\nthe choice that they made was to\nprioritize political posturing and a\ndistorted view of individual liberty\nover the health of Americans and what\nwas the result of that\nwe lost so many lives unnecessarily\nbecause of that choice\nbut going forward we can choose better\nwe can make a different choice we do not\nhave to continue to make Public Health a\npartisan political issue\nit is a fact that the covet vaccine\nsaved lives and continues to save lives\nall of us prior to 2020 had not\nexperienced life in a global pandemic\nnone of us had and what we have seen\nsince then is more than a million\nAmericans have died\nincluding about 42 000 Georgians\nbut fortunately we have a vaccine for\ncovet 19. it was created evaluated and\nauthorized for use in about a year\nresearchers were able to leverage\nprevious coronavirus and vaccine\nresearch to develop a vaccine for this\ndisease and record time and what does\nThat vaccine do it does what vaccines do\nit reduces transmission and reduces the\nseverity of illness to save lives\nour message about this should be that\nthis is a feat of Science and Innovation\nthis is a good thing we should be\nshouting this from the rooftops and\nthat's what we should have been doing\nfor three years but we're not we're\nplaying political games\nshould not be our message this only\nworks if people get the vaccine and we\nhave a role to play as leaders in making\nsure that people do that\nsb1 does not send that message it uses\nour powerful platform as Leaders to give\noxygen to misinformation and it sets\npeople up to contract and transmit a\npreventable disease\nmeanwhile our Georgia Department of\nPublic Health is communicating accurate\ninformation about coveted vaccines and\naccurate information about other\nvaccines if you go to their website you\nwill see information about requirements\nfor some vaccines in some circumstances\nand recommendations for vaccines and\nother circumstances it is consistent in\nits messaging of confidence and trust\nthat these are life-saving measures that\nwe should be encouraging Georgians to\ntake part in\nand we are going to contradict that for\npolitics\nthat is bad policy and bad governance\nunfortunately as some of my colleagues\nhave noted the harm done by this bill is\nnot limited to covet 19. misinformation\nmuch like viruses has a tendency to\nspread and there's a very unfortunate\nspillover effect with covid-19 vaccine\nmisinformation it leads to mistrust of\nother types of vaccination including\nvaccinations we have been relying on for\ndecades vaccines to address measles and\nother childhood illnesses measles was\nconsidered eradicated in the year 2000\nand we're now seeing outbreaks of this\npreventable illness in American children\nbecause of misinformation\nlast year in Ohio 77 children under the\nage of five got sick with measles\none-third of those were hospitalized\nspeaking to the parents here do you\nremember what it was like when you had a\nchild under five and that child got sick\nespecially maybe if you were a new\nparent and it was your first child it's\nterrifying\nand we are allowing a situation where\nmisinformation is leading to children\nbeing hospitalized when they don't need\nto be\nthis is not something we used to see in\nthe U.S we didn't see this level of\nvaccine hesitancy that we see now at the\nsame time of that Ohio outbreak there\nwas a study from the Kaiser Family\nFoundation that reflected a significant\nrise in parents who oppose vaccine\nrequirements in schools that's grown\nsignificantly since 2019 that's a direct\nresult of the pandemic how we mishandled\nit and the way we let misinformation\ngrow\nyou can draw a direct line from bills\nlike sb1 to vaccine hesitancy to lower\nvaccination rates to outbreaks of\npreventable illness in children there is\na relationship between and among those\nthings\nso in closing I just want to remind us\nall of the position of influence and\npower that we have just from the fact\nthat we sit in these seats the choices\nwe make as Leaders matter\nare we going to be a voice for accurate\nevidence-based information are we going\nto join the loud chorus of folks who\nlike to sow distrust and spread\nmisinformation We cannot put good\ninformation and bad information on an\nequal plane and that's what sb1 does we\ncan't do it when the stakes are this\nHigh the stakes are our neighbor's\nhealth\nso I ask you please vote no on sb1 and I\nyield the well\nthank you Mr Speaker the lady has\nyielded well representative Lisa\nCampbell is recognized to speak\nto the bill as part of The Minority\nReport representative Campbell\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues today I Rise Against Senate\nbill one\nand I encourage everyone in this chamber\nto take just a few minutes and I promise\na few minutes\nto think about the long-term positive\nimpact we could have on our children's\nhealth by voting no\nthis bill allows the prohibition against\nrequiring proof of covet vaccination to\nstand\nnot just this year\nbut permanently\nand as we Mark the second anniversary of\nthe U.S covid-19 vaccination campaign\nunderstanding the impact of vaccines on\nreducing disease burden is needed to\ninform our future\nevidence-based action on this bill today\nit has been almost two and a half years\nsince the first coveted vaccine was\ngiven in the U.S and since then listen\nto this y'all we have administered more\nthan\n655 million doses\neighty percent of the population has\nreceived at least one dose\nwith a cumulative effect of preventing\nmore than 18 million additional\nhospitalizations\n18 million hospitalizations were\nprevented\nand More Than 3 million additional\ndeaths\nin early 2021 when the coveted vaccines\nwere widely distributed there was a huge\ndemand we remember it right at the peak\nof the vaccination campaign 4 million\npeople got vaccinated in one day\nthat demand dropped off by the summer\nand two years later many states are\nstill barely north of 50 percent of\npeople fully vaccinated including in\nGeorgia\nso how many lives would have been saved\nif that slump in vaccine demand had\nnever happened have you ever wondered\nabout this\nto answer that question Brown University\nand Microsoft researchers calculated the\npeak vaccination rate for each state and\nthen imagined that that rate continued\nuntil all adults in the state were fully\nvaccinated\nthe total for the country is Stark\nyes many of the nearly one million\ncoveted deaths took place in 2020 before\nvaccines\nbut from December 2020 through November\n2022 these researchers estimate that the\ncovid vaccination program\ncould have prevented more than 18.5\nmillion additional hospitalizations and\n3.2 million additional deaths\nwithout vaccination there would have\nbeen nearly 120 million more covid-19\ninfections\nthe vaccination program also saved the\nU.S\n1.15 trillion dollars in medical costs\nand these numbers are even more striking\nin certain states where more than half\nof the deaths could have been avoided\nhalf of the deaths could have been\navoided\nin Georgia at least 13 000 deaths\ncould have been averted by vaccination\naccording to that research\nso in addition to tying our hands to\nprevent ongoing illness it is worth\nnoting the trends of declining coveted\nvaccination rates as others have shared\nare increasingly spilling over into\nother routine immunizations\ndid you all know that Georgia is the\nfourth least vaccinated state in the\nnation\nnumber one for business but number 48th\nfor vaccination rates and that's for all\nvaccinations not just coven\nand Studies have found that Georgia\nranks in the bottom for vaccine rates\nfor our children for flu 47th for adults\nfor flu and 42nd for the number of\nadults even vaccinated for tetanus\nthese Trends began before the pandemic\nand are historically low rates are\nworsening according to the new data from\nCDC that shows the percentage of U.S\nchildren entering kindergarten their\nrequired immunizations fell to 93\npercent in 2022\npercentage points below the recommended\nherd immunity levels of 95 and lower\neven still than vaccination rates in\n2021.\nand while one or two percentage points\nmight not seem concerning\none percent represents tens of thousands\nof people children who may be\ninadequately protected from diseases we\ncan easily prevent through immunization\nthese Trends are alarming both for our\nhealth and our finances\nthe CDC estimated that vaccinating\nchildren born from 1994 to 2018\nwould prevent\n472 million illnesses that's why we're\ntalking about this it would prevent\nnearly 30 million hospitalizations and\nmore than a million deaths\nthe state-run vaccination requirements\nare also projected to save\n479 billion dollars in health care costs\nand other related costs\nare unvaccinated are a great risk\nbecause the disease vaccines prevent\nhave few effective treatments\neven in this day of great medical\nadvances children who are unvaccinated\nare not protected against the suffering\nthe complications and the long-term\ndisability that can come from vaccine\npreventable diseases\nand one last thought\neveryone in this chamber\nwho cheers go dogs after every single\nprayer\njust know that we personally\nbenefited from required proof of\nvaccinations\nfor measles mumps rubella chickenpox\ntetanus Hepatitis B TB\nwhy in the world are we going to be\ndenying these same protections for\nstudents\nall of this comes down to trust\nwhether our political leadership creates\nthe climate of trust in the public\nhealth agency's efforts in the science\nin the ability of our health care sister\nsystem to deliver\nthis is not about discrimination\nit is in fact about the health of all\nGeorgians and for all of these reasons I\nask you to please seriously consider\nvoting no on this bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nthat completes the Minority Report\nnow we'll have for up to 20 minutes for\nchairs time\ncheerleaded Cooper is recognized\nfor the chairs time\nthank you Mr Speaker but I would like to\nyield my time to Chairman Todd Jones\nchairman Jones is recognized to speak to\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I appreciate it and\nI appreciate my colleagues providing\nthat information but I'd like to be able\nto provide the chamber with I'll just\nsay maybe something else to think about\nI think first and foremost let's think\nabout what the last year has brought up\non for us I think we have had I'll say\nan upward right trajectory within our\nstate and that has been with this law in\nplace by taking out the sunset we don't\ndo anything to take the trajectory off\nfine I think the second thing we heard a\nlot about undermining public trust\nundermining Public Health I think that's\njust a fallacy let me think about this\nfor just one moment in the latter parts\nof 2020 president-elect Joe Biden said\nwho is going to take the shot are you\ngoing to be the first person to take it\nVice president-elect Kamala Harris when\nreferring to the development of the\nvaccine said it's untrustworthy\nwe did not hear\neither party talking about undermining\nthe public health but I could keep going\nDr fauci said all three vaccines are 100\neffective against death and\nhospitalization I think if given the\nopportunity he would sit in this well\nand say I was wrong\nthis bill is not about whether or not we\ncan have an argument over is it or isn't\nit in terms of the pandemic and the\ntreatment of sedge what we're saying is\nwe're not going to permit discrimination\nwe do not want discrimination when it\ncomes to the state its subdivisions as\nagencies its authorities to be able to\nprovide services necessary services to\nour citizens\nanother speaker talked about the ability\nto wear masks I say please do so it is\nyour absolutely your individual right to\nwear a mask and take the vaccine if\nyou'd like get a booster every four\nweeks I encourage that\nin terms of the speaker that spoke to\nthe idea that this was going to\nundermine the state's ability to attack\nother pandemics and let's hope in all of\nour lifetimes there's not another\npandemic but if there is this bill only\nspeaks to the covid vaccine it does not\nspeak to any other animal vaccine or any\nother animal flu\nin terms of what we can do as a state\ngood or bad we have data that tells us\nover the last two and a half years we\nhave had educational loss that is\ngenerational generational for our\nchildren\nwe know what we have done it needs to be\nfixed and that Gap needs to be closed\nand we will do that\nlet's talk a little bit about mistrust\nit was commented by a speaker regarding\nthe mistrust of certain news agencies\nlet's talk about what happened to the\nPublic Square in the new Public Square\nbeing that one made up online\nof Twitter and Google and Facebook and\nmeta and Instagram\nlet's talk about who was told you're\nde-platformed let's talk about who was\ntold your content is wrong this is\nsupposed to be the Public Square there's\nsupposed to be a free exchange of\ninformation and ideas and brainstorming\nbut yet what happened you were basically\nshut down if you did not follow what as\nwe turned out to know certain federal\nagencies did not want you to say on\nthose particular platforms\nanother comment was made about children\nwe all get very I'll say Melancholy we\nall get very serious when it comes to\nour children and we should\nagain this isn't a bill about the\nefficacy or not efficacy of the vaccine\nor whether or not we should do this or\nthat but let's get the facts straight\nchildren underneath the age of 17.\nstatistically\nthey literally were 25 to 50 percent\nless fatality rate for covid than for\nthe annual flu\nwe don't shut down schools we don't shut\ndown economies we don't shut down States\nand we definitely don't discriminate\nagainst our citizens because of the\nannual flu why would we suddenly want to\ndo it now\nthe last two points I'd like to make\nhopefully\nwill give a little bit of I guess a\nclear Earth story of my feelings\nthere is no intent to undermine any\nother vaccines to my colleague in the\nminority party I absolutely agree with\nher and I truly believe that MMR polio\netc those are absolutely critical and I\nhope that we still see that I don't have\ngrandkids yet but when they do I expect\nto be able to push those through\nbut making the assumption\nthat this bill not just undermines the\nvaccine but what the minority party did\nnot contemplate inside of any other\ncomments\nwas natural immunity\nwe never heard the phrase of natural\nimmunity and what that would do in terms\nof helping our citizens be able to fight\nthis virus and I think it is something\nthat is definitely not considered\nfurther we know from listening to\nscientists that The lethality of this\nvirus just like others\nstarted high and came down low\nwe also know more about the\ncomorbidities and we can keep going in\nterms of the effect that they had\nBut ultimately that's not what this bill\nis about\nthis bill is simple\nthis bill does not allow the state its\nsubdivisions its agencies its\nauthorities to discriminate\nwe don't want people to be discriminated\nagainst to not get a fishing license to\nnot get a hunting license and not get\ntheir driver's license but I will give\nyou one that I would say is more\nimportant than all of that\nwe don't want a subdivision of this\nstate to even consider\nsaying for you to vote there's a\nrequirement like this\nand let's think about that for a moment\nMr Speaker that ends my comments and I\nask for the favorable consideration from\nthe body for sb1\nthe gentleman a geodewell\nis there any objection to a Greenville\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the past of the bill Jerry\nhas

to present\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues uh\nSenate Bill 164 is very similar to a\nbill we passed earlier in the session\nHouse Bill 215 that dealt with a license\nuh for advanced practice registered\nnurses once again all nurses all RNs do\nhave a license now and then they get\nauthorization to practice within an\nadvanced area whether it's certified\nnurse Midwife of nurse practitioner\nCRNA or a clinical nurse specialist\nSenate Bill 164 will allow the nursing\nboard to also give them a particular\nlicense for recognizing this additional\ntraining that they've gotten rather than\njust an authorization it'll it will it's\nsomething that's that's very desired by\nthose that put in that hard work that's\nrequired to get that advanced practice\nRegistered Nursing degree there's no\nchange in scope of practice this also\nhas a second section on it that\nrecognizes anesthesiology assistance\nthose are physician assistants Pas but\nthey're specifically and exclusively in\nan area of of anesthesiology or\nanesthesia anesthesiologist assistant\nand so there's a section in the bill\nthat clarifies that their licensure\ncomes just like really identical to all\nthe other physician assistants but those\nare more like generalists and\nanesthesiologist assistant is like a a\nparticular specialty of a physician\nassistant I think the two things are\ngreat recognition of what we've talked\nabout earlier about the teamwork\nrequired in in this I think they're\ndeserving of having their own license or\ntheir own section in the code like\nanesthesiologist assistant I hope that's\nsomething that we can we can move\nforward on and once again pass\nunanimously\nglad to answer any questions Mr Speaker\nyou have no questions thank you and I\nappreciate your

amount of\ndollars uh this this and you don't like\nhearing that or seeing that it's Bill\nyou're going to like what this bill does\nit it\num it allows for attorneys or lawyers to\nadvertise but it doesn't allow for them\nto essentially misrepresent what they\ncan and can't do it's okay to say that\nyou know we have we've had good outcomes\nbut it's not okay to say\num we're a hundred percent\num you know winners here or basically\num over represent what they can do\nthat's the first part of the bill it\nbasically regulates the\num the attorneys and lawyers from uh\ngoing Beyond just puffing and telling\nyou that they're a good Law Firm but uh\ngoing going to a point where they're\nsaying I'm 100 going to be able to\ndeliver for you and I'm going to get you\nuh x amount of dollars so that's one\nportion of the bill in uh Judiciary we\nmade an amendment and and the amendment\nwe made was the Apex doctrine that this\nhouse has already passed and what the\nApex Doctrine is just as a review is a\ndoctrine that allows for protections\nagainst\num unreasonable deposition so if you do\nnot have unique knowledge of something\nand you're a high-ranking official\num uh let's just say of a large\ncorporation and there's no need for you\nto be deposed or asked to be answered\nquestions because of the knowledge you\ncan get from a lower ranking\nofficial or employee then there will be\na protection for that a protective order\nagainst having to be deposed and so this\nis a tort reform measure that we passed\nearlier on in this session we've added\nit on to make sure

presently have\nthis so it's nothing new it's a\nstate-led incentive initiative to\npartner with farmers who wish to protect\nour precious Farmland from development\nuh so by working with Farmers\num voluntarily\nwill restrict our development rights uh\nand and set up this program this program\nuh does not have any funding with it\nthis is just a mechanism to establish it\nthis year\num it coordinates with federal dollars\nand local matching funds to extend these\nuh conservation easements uh USDA\npresently allocates 450 million dollars\nnationally uh for this Farmland\nprotection and Georgia president is not\nof course receiving uh the its share of\nthat so it will match one for one dollar\nuh for dollar uh if we raise a private\ndonations or\num State funds in the future but it uh\nyou know protects Georgia's number one\neconomic sector agriculture spans water\nquality\nwildlife habitat and green space around\nour are developing Metro areas and you\nknow we um you see this beautiful\nFarmland out there and it's just got\nprohibited for a lot of small farmers\nto uh to not be tempted to develop sell\ntheir land for apartment complexes\ncommercial and this just really keeps a\ngreat balance it's a great voluntary\nprogram\nand um and and I just think it's\nsomething that Georgia needs uh this\nyear and uh it just really gives\npriority to those type lands uh that are\nthreatened for development so uh I asked\nyour Fable consideration on SB 220.\nif there's uh any questions I'll be\nhappy to take you have no questions\nthank you I yield oil the gentleman

two\namend article 3 chapter 18 and title 45\nof the official to George annotated\nrelated state employees plan counsel so\nit requires such counsel to establish\nhealth savings accounts and to\ncontinually provide for education or\nsalary reductions for such accounts this\nbill Landry for the committee on health\nthat committee recommends that this bill\nto pass by rules committee substitute\nchairman Chuck Martin is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you thank you Mr Speaker ladies\nand gentlemen let me first address the\nrule substitute this is the same bill\nthat you've had out of committee there\nwas a scrivener's error on line 26 uh\nthe date was improperly reflected in the\nprevious version as 2024 it should have\nbeen 2025 that's how it came out of the\nSenate that's how it came out of\ncommittee somehow it got changed so just\nto address the reason for the rule\nsubstitute it was to fix the scriveness\nera now to the meat of the Bell there's\nnot a year I've been down here where we\nhaven't had somebody in the employee uh\nof George or TRS or ER has come to us\nand want to enhance the retirement\nsystem generally that always costs money\nit always costs somebody we have a bill\nthis afternoon ladies and gentlemen that\nweekend pass and we can pass it and it\ndoes not cost money and it is good for\nour employees this will allow us to\nimplement a health spending account this\nis different from a health saving\naccount a use it or loses use it or lose\nit type benefit that happens this is\ndollars that would be pre-tax that you\ncan save will you not pay federal state\nincome tax you don't pay FICA on it and\nthen you can spend it on your health\nneeds if you're part of a high\ndeductible insurance plan about five to\nseven percent of our employees in the\nstate are part of that plan now we\nsuspect that would go up when this tax\nbenefit is in order so what we have here\nis a situation where people can put\nmoney aside and pay for their health\ncare costs with pre-tax dollars that's a\nbig deal I want to thank Senator Estevez\nfor bringing that to us out of the\nSenate and allowing me to bring this to\nyou today so very simply put this is all\nenabling and it asks our\ndepartment at the state to put the plan\ntogether so that folks can have pre-tax\ndollars to pay for health the last thing\nI would add is when you get to be 65\nwithout penalty you can use these funds\nfor other reasons so Mr Speaker this is\na good enhancement that we want to bring\nto our employees the university system\noffers it to their employees and their\nsystem now and this will save this will\nsave Untold dollars for our um our\nemployees across the state that are able\nto take advantage of with that I'll\nanswer any technical questions that I'm\nable to\ngentlemen yield to your neighbor\nchairman Williamson to your right\nMr speakers absolutely for a question\nyes sir is it not for the truth that not\nonly save the employee tax dollars it\nalso is portable should they lose leave\nemployment and they can take that plan\nwith them absolutely and I thank the\ngeneral for the question yes this is\nthis goes into their health savings\naccount so this is their money to\ncontrol and um if they if they leave the\nemployee at the state they can take that\nwith them further in in reality it saves\nthe state money as well because any\ndollars that go into this plan the state\nwould not be uh responsible their\nportion of FICA on that also because\nit's pre-tax money this this just allows\nour employees to Pro pay for medical\nexpenses with pre-tax dollars quite\nfrankly it allows the federal government\nto help us pay\num help our employees pay for their\nhealth care costs no further questions\nMr Speaker I'll yield the well\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion be in order the chair hears\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to

a\npro-law enforcement bill that will allow\nthose who put themselves at risk every\nsingle day by protecting our communities\nallowing those Law Enforcement Officers\nif they request their local

County websites Mr\nSpeaker that's simply what the bill does\nto help our law enforcement officers who\nprotect us every single day\ngentlemen yield for a question I will\npark has a question can we feel\nrecognized thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman you I will so while I almost\nalways appreciate uh house versions of\nbills as opposed to the senate in this\ninstance I know the bill seems to have\ngreatly narrowed the scope of the bill\njust the law enforcement officers as\nopposed to public employees why was the\nbill narrow just because I think all\npublic employees should otherwise\ndeserve the protections this bill\nprovides sure so the bill was narrowed\nthe bill sponsoring the Senate the great\nSenate rules chairman Matt brass had hit\nthe original intent of the bill and the\nthe reason he brought this was a\nconstituent issue related to Law\nEnforcement Officers so we worked\ntogether to craft a more more narrow\ntailored bill that addressed his\nconcerns thank you\ngentlemen yield for one more question I\nwill representative Hutchinson to your\nright in the back towards your back does\nthe gentleman yield I will\nso piggyback on my colleague's question\nI had a I had a client that found my\nhome address and sent me dead animals to\nmy house is there any way we can expand\nthis to cover therapists\nuh well again this bill uh if you have a\nlegislator wants to bring another\nmeasure certainly that would be up to\nthem I do believe uh that certain\ngovernment employees judges and actually\nI believe state legislators can request\ntheir their address to be removed from Q\npublic but this would make sure the law\nenforcement can do so and that's what\nSenate Bill 215 is here for today\nMr Speaker if there's no are there any\nfurther

to the committee on education\nthat committee recommends this bill do\npass by rules committee substitute\nchairman Todd Jones is recognized to\npresent the bill chairman Jones\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues I'm here to present\nSB 233\nlc491458s which is a committee rules\nsubstitute\nthis is a pretty big day and excited\nabout being in front of you for the\nGeorgia promise scholarship act this is\na face effectively an opportunity for\nthe state to take the next step in terms\nof doing something that my Public School\nMentor for the last 22 years always told\nme\nand that's this\nput the child at the center of every\ndecision you make in K-12\nand I've been fortunate enough for 22\nyears to be able to do that and today I\nthink we have an opportunity with SB 233\nto do exactly that\nthe voucher effectively has five key\ncomponents but before I get into the\ncomponents I want to mention to you a\ncouple of things\nit has been narrowly defined in terms of\nour our ability to provide this type of\nopportunity and choice to the students\nwithin the state of Georgia more\nspecifically this is being provided to\nthe families who attend the bottom 25 of\npublic schools in the state of Georgia\nso this is a chance to say to those\nchildren\nto those families\nwe are here to give you an opportunity a\nchoice to be able to go to an\nalternative\nto be able to do something at home or\nthrough hybrid that will allow you to be\nable to extend the educational\nopportunity\nwe've been fortunate within the\neducation committee and I'd like to\nthank the chairman\nto be able to have former\nsuperintendents\nPublic School teachers members of the\nBoard of Education\nto be able to come together and\nformulate this bill\nthis bill truly hits the mark in so many\nplaces and let me give you the five that\nI would like to focus on today\nfirst in terms of the participating\nstudent\na question had been asked a\nparticipating student and their\neligibility what does that mean\na student must attend two consecutive\ncounts at their assigned Public School\nfor those who do not know we take\naccount generally speaking in October\nand March of each year\nso what we're saying is is that they\nmust be there continuously I want to\nstress continuously for two counts\ntypically it'll be October March\nbut it could be sometimes March October\nbut what we're saying there is for a\nfull year\nfor the parent the parent must reside in\nthe state of Georgia for an entire year\nreside in the state of Georgia for an\nentire year and must also commit to not\nenroll their child full-time in the\npublic school system must commit not to\nstack what do I mean by not stacking\nthey may not take an SSO many of you\nconsider that to be a goal scholarship\nthey can't take a special needs\nscholarship\nthese are the things that we wanted to\nensure that we again narrowly focused on\nwhat this bill is going to do in terms\nof providing for choice and opportunity\nin terms of funding\nthis is an important thing in terms of\nwe did not touch education funding\nbut rather we said this is based on\nappropriation this would be a line item\nfrom an appropriation made by this body\nand then also our colleagues on the\nother side of the third floor and then\nultimately the governor of our state and\nit would provide for sixty five hundred\ndollars on an annual basis\naccountability there have been so many\ncomments made and frankly good comments\nand constructive comments made in terms\nof how do we ensure that the taxpayers\nmoney is being appropriately used how do\nwe make sure that the students that are\nin this program are basically getting\nthe education they need and how can we\nbe confident\nwell I think we've been able to hit that\nand we've hit it strongly there will be\nreporting on an annual basis back to the\ncommission\nthat reporting will be both of a\nfinancial nature and then also of an\nachievement nature\nthe students that participate in this\nvoucher program and this includes\nhomeschool students hybrid students and\nprivate school students will be tested\nmore than our public school students I\nwant to say that one more time\nthey will be required on an annual basis\nto take a norm reference test\nevery year we do not do that to our\npublic school students but you will see\nin the accountability section there's a\nchoice between going the norm reference\ntest or what the public school gives in\nthat particular grade year of course the\nmost I'll say famous one is the third\ngrade year\nfrom a transparency standpoint the\ncommission is required to put the\nreports up\nit's going to include both aggregate\ndata and personally delimited data so\nwe're going to know from each School the\nindividual when did they attend what\ntheir attendance was what their\nachievement was how much of the account\ndid they use from a homeschool point of\nview very similar\nand that leads to the account\na question was asked how is the account\ndone please think of your HSA or\nsomething similar this is third party\nadministered that money is not fungible\nit does not go to the parent but rather\nit sits as an approved account that may\nonly be used\nfor Approved expenses that are made by\nthe commission the commission will\ndelineate what are approved expenses may\nthey be an accredited private school\nmay they be a textbook may they be any\ntype of supplement\nspeech therapy Ock therapy and up to 500\nof Transportation\nwe are confident that with the help of\nso many stakeholders we have put\ntogether the narrowest but we think\ngoing to be a very effective Choice\nprogram\nand we hope\nthat once this is implemented people\nwill see that we are able to\ncross-spectrum and make sure that this\ntype of accountability and transparency\ntruly lifted this program to be the best\nin the nation Mr Speaker that is the\nreview of sb233 I asked for your\nfavorable consideration and Mr Speaker I\nwould stand for questions\ngentlemen is yielding for questions uh\nlet's see\nchair recognizes will park right out to\nyour left in front of you thank you Mr\nchairman does the gentleman yield\nyes Mr whip is it not true that in the\npast 20 years public education in the\nstate of Georgia has been underfunded by\nat least 20 billion dollars and per\npupil spending is now ranking 38th in\nthe country\nwhat park I want to look at it just\nslightly different than that in my mind\nwe have fully funded QBE uh the last\nfour years we are now aggressively doing\nI would say not just the right thing in\nliteracy but also in compensation our\nteachers now if you factor in the cost\nof living are in the top five of our\nUnion and then in addition to that our\nschool systems all 180 cumulatively sit\non over six billion dollars in reserve\nwhich means they have more money in\nreserve than the state of Georgia the\neighth largest economy in our country\nand the 24th largest economy in the in\nthe world this gentleman for the yield\nyes so in understanding and admitting\nthe fact that systemically we have\nunderfunded our schools for decades\nwhich has had a generational impact is\nit not true that this bill would further\nharm and take money away from rural\nschools in particular especially because\nin in parts of Rural and South Georgia\nthere are no no private schools that\naccept vouchers\nis that not true I would disagree with\nthat and for two reasons Mr whip first I\nwas privileged to be the K-12\nAppropriations chair and I saw\nconsistently per capita spending that\nwas say double of my home school\ndistrict sometimes two and a half of my\nhome school district yet my home school\ndistrict had I'll say\nfar superior outcomes than the ones that\nwere spending 2x 2.5 x\ndoes a gentleman yield for a final\nquestion yes is it not true that some of\nthe largest public education\norganizations in Georgia from Georgia\nAssociation of Educators the\nprofessional association of Georgia\nEducators strongly opposes this bill\nbecause of the harm that it would cause\nthe public education in the state I\ncan't speak for those associations but I\nknow this based on the incremental\nfunding that when you look at the\nvoucher and you look at the funding that\nwould remain with the school system\nmeaning the local\nwould stay 100 with them the federal\nwould stay 100 with them the non-qe\nwould stay 100 with them then we can say\nwith confidence and we also have this\naffirmed by uh Mr or Dr Dorfman the\nstate's Economist that a vast majority\nof school districts on a per capita\nbasis will actually have an increase in\nfunding not a decrease in funding and\nfurthermore I think for the rural School\nDistrict or any of the districts that\nhave schools in the bottom 25 percent we\nthen would have in my opinion if people\nchose to do this a better student\nteacher ratio which I would hope would\nproduce better student outcomes because\nultimately we put the student at the\ncenter of everything that we do would\nyou do it for one final of course Mr\nwhip\nagain and saying we want to put students\nfirst perhaps it'd be best to listen to\nteachers who teach our students and try\nand put them first every day in the\nclassroom thank you sir thank you Mr\nwhip\ngentlemen yield yes sir\nchair lady silcox stay on the center\naisle has a question\ndoes the gentleman yield yes\nrepresentative\nisn't it true Mr chairman that this\ncould also serve as an economic\ndevelopment tool for people to move in\nareas of the state where there's New\nEconomic Development projects but not\nalways great schools to support those\nprojects by allowing people to use their\nfunds in alternative ways to educate\ntheir children\nI do believe the downstream implication\nwill be absolutely a lift of I'll say\nall boats Rising with a rising tide and\nfrom an economic development standpoint\nI think the data would show from a\nRealty standpoint and from where\nbusiness want to park themselves because\ngetting employees in is very important\nas absolutely you could see this that\nway absolutely thank you\nrepresentative fry to your left is\nrecognized for a question\nthank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman\nyield yes representative\nisn't it true when touting your home\nDistrict's success that you leave out\nthe fact that you\nprobably live in a pretty wealthy part\nof the state\nwith a pretty homogeneous population\nthat doesn't have the difficulties that\nsome of the other school districts May\nface\nrepresentative there is no doubt that\nForsyth county is blessed however in\nterms of homogeny my district based on\nthe last census report had 81\nnationalities and I welcome you to come\nto my district and I think you will see\nthat I have several schools that are\nmajority minority and we're very proud\nof that and so I appreciate the question\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk\nabout the diversity in Forsyth County\nand also the Excellence that we have in\noutcomes in Forsyth County you further\nyield yes\ncan you explain what your version of a\ndefinition of a failing school might be\nyeah if you you can go to the website\nwithout the doe publishes on an annual\nbasis and cpri will be able to provide\nthat to you it's a weighted algorithm\nsir based on achievement schedules\noutcomes Etc sure does gentleman for the\nyield yes representative are there any\nare there any issues that these\nso-called failing schools\nthat\ncan be solved\nby taking students and money away from\nthose schools well first and foremost Mr\nrepresentative I think the premise that\nwe are taking money away is not a proper\npremise and a proper Foundation I think\nlet's think about this and I want to\nmake sure I read this so I don't just do\nit off you know memory there are 22\nelementary schools in Georgia last year\nin which at least three quarters of the\nthird grade students couldn't read on\ngrade level and another 68 schools were\ntwo-thirds of the three third graders\nhad fallen behind there were 10 middle\nschools where zero percent of the eighth\ngraders not one child scored proficient\nin math and another 28 no more than five\npercent of the eighth graders so I would\nsay continuing to do the exact same\nthing and expecting different outcomes\ncould possibly lead you to a path that\ndoesn't make sense but what would\npossibly make sense is giving the family\nan opportunity to have the choice to be\nable to say is there an alternative that\nwould work better otherwise I think\nthere's an opportunity yeah we will\ncontinue we don't see this as an or we\nsee it as an and help the public system\nand provide choice this isn't an either\nor you've seen us going ahead together\nwe have funded uh seven thousand dollars\nof teacher salary increases over the\nlast four years we have done I think\nthis year's budget is 13.1 billion into\nthe public school system we'll continue\nto make those Investments absolutely but\nat the same time we need to be able to\nlift up everyone and give everyone a\nchoice because I think it's unrealistic\nto believe that any entity can address\n100 of its target market\nthank you one more question uh yes sir\nso what do you think is the cause of\nthose\nlow reading scores in those schools so I\nthink if you're going to talk about a\nsystemic that's going to be a\nconversation that you and I should\nprobably take to the Annie room or maybe\ngo grab a drink and I don't mean to say\nthat facetiously I mean that seriously I\nthink we have a series of different\nchallenges between birth to four in\nterms of what we're doing in the birth\nto four area what we're doing in pre-k\nwhat we're doing in terms of being able\nto lift up those families that need that\nassistance between birth and foreign\nPre-K but there's a series of different\nthings going on but I know this once\nthey get to K-12 we got to be able to\nprovide a system that allows the family\nto have an opportunity and I hope it's\nthe public school system all four of my\nchildren went through public school I'm\nan empty nester now but I do know this\nbeing able to provide choice to them\nwill give them an option and hopefully\nbe able to lift everyone including the\npublic school system because my belief\nis we will get a better student to\nteacher ratio if the vouchers are in\nfact accepted\nI appreciate your responses okay thank\nyou Mr representative Mr Speaker I'm\ngoing to yield the well because I know\nthere's several people who want to want\nto speak to this uh bill and I know that\nwe are short on time thank you very much\nsir\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nand he is correct\nhere is our posture\nthose opposed have 30 minutes and those\nin favor have 30 minutes\nthe minority we have a Minority Report\nthat will be allocated 20 minutes and\nchairs time for 20 minutes\nat this time the chair will recognize\nrepresentative Doreen Carter\nto begin 30 minutes\nrepresentative Carter\nthank you Mr Speaker\nyou know I love coming to the well I\nlove coming down here to tell you guys\nabout good stuff I love coming to the\nwell talking to encourage you\nencouraging you to take care of\nyourselves\nbut today I'm really not happy about\ncoming to the well you know when I was\nelected one of the things that I was so\nexcited about as a parent at kids in\nschool at the time was we were actually\ngoing to come down to the Georgia state\ncapitol and we were going to figure out\nhow to\ntransform education in the state of\nGeorgia\nbecause we know how important education\nis\nand because the majority the masses of\nour students go to public schools and I\nI really thought that education\nfor the people matter\nbut as I've been on this education\ncommittee\nit is abundantly clear\nthat public education doesn't matter in\nthe state of Georgia\nat the beginning of this session I was\nhopeful because our chairman talked\nabout how his priorities were literacy\nand safety\nand he said go and find some legislation\nbe creative be Innovative on how we can\naddress literacy so we went to work\nthere were some other people working and\nultimately we came out with a couple\npieces of legislation and y'all I was\nhappy because finally we were going to\ntackle that thing that we knew was going\nto make a difference in the lives of our\nchildren because we kept hearing about\nhow third grade test scores was the\nindicator on how many jail cells we were\ngoing to have to increase so I said oh\nlook at Georgia we're about to tackle\nliteracy and we can stop increasing the\nfunding to increase the jail capacity\nbecause we were going to slow that\npipeline down and you know what we\npassed a piece of legislation out of\nthis house it was HB 538 and it is a\nreally good piece of legislation y'all\nbut\nwe didn't fund it\nwe said let the locals find the money\nfor those curriculums you know what else\none of the key indicators that made the\ndifference in those States who have\nincreased their literacy scores were\nliteracy coaches and you know that was\nthe thing that was left out\nthe literacy coaches why because it was\ngonna cost\nto much\nso here we go\nwe didn't fund that\nbut we figured out a way to uh figure\nout a way to find some money in the\nbudget\nbecause it's going to be appropriated\nwe don't need a physical note\nto find sixty five hundred dollars per\nstudent on endless amount of students in\nthe state of Georgia\nfrom the time they get in this program\ntoday leave High School\nwe're talking Millions ultimately\nbillions of dollars that will come out\nof the appropriated budget\nnow mind you they said it's not going to\ncome out of education budget because\nthey're not transferring dollars from\neducation budget\nto the voucher\nfund\nright well let's think about it\nlet's do some simple math we're going to\ntalk about the budget let's talk about\nyour personal budget right so you got a\ncouple things you've got income and\nyou've got expenses so unless you have\nunlimited income you got just so much\nyou can do right and then you're gonna\ndivvy it up well we know what about 54\nof our budget goes to education so you\ngot something left so what's left so\nwhatever is left we're going to\nappropriate that money so that we can\npay for vouchers now if it ends up one\nof those years where we're in a\nrecession and we have living and money\nyou know what's going to happen we're\nstill going to have to find those\nvouchers yeah but what we're going to do\nis we're going to cut the education\nbudget because that's what Georgia has\ndone historically when we get our budget\nand we need to go here's all our\nexpenses but here's the income so hold\nup we got to balance this budget so how\ndo we balance the budget we cut the\neducation budget\nbut you're right over the last couple\nyears we had a little Surplus and it\nfeels good even our personal budgets\nwhen we have a little Surplus right so\nwhat we do we spend a little extra but\nsome of us who are conservative\nin our finances we don't spend\neverything we still set a little bit of\nthe side so we don't start making extra\nexpenses or going by big things because\nyou know what did last year might have\nbeen a good year but do we know two\nyears down the road is going to be a\ngood year so we try to save some not\nhere in the state of Georgia let's\nfigure out how to get the money away so\nwe can come back and cut the education\nbudget so for for whoever believes that\nyou are not going to be taking money out\nof your public school because that money\nis going to come out that education\nbudget one way or the other but another\nthing I want you to think about so we've\ntalked about the money but who can\nattend there's one group kids who are\nnot going to be eligible to take\nadvantage of this voucher that you guys\nmay or may not pass but you know what\nonly I Have 112. This concerns me and as\na and some of you who have children and\nthose you will listen to me help\nchildren that you're trying to do the\nbest thing for if your student is\nenrolled in a school that's operated by\nthe Department of Juvenile Justice\nthey're not going to be eligible part of\nthe thing I think some people don't\nunderstand that people those kids are at\nYouth Challenge that are operated by the\nDepartment of Juvenile Justice they're\nnot criminals they're youth with\nchallenges so parents send them there so\nthat they can keep them out of trouble\nbut if those parents had another option\nto do some other type of school they\nwould be they would send them there but\nthose kids won't get to go now let's\ntalk about let's talk about this\nthe lowest 25 of schools in the state of\nGeorgia they are outside for the most\npart Metro Atlanta so you know what when\nwe took that map and we looked at the\nlast time that 25 was uh those schools\nwere identified and then we took another\nmap and we looked at where those private\nopportunities were\nthey weren't in those areas where those\nkids said they're gonna need those those\nuh services so what are we going to do\nso we just I think I just heard a\nquestion back there so we're going to\nhave some influent people move into some\nnon-afluent areas to ensure that they're\nin a school with a low 25 and they're\ngoing to be the ones that's going to\ntake advantage of that money now the\naccountant in me kicked in too so let's\ntalk about this we want to make sure\nthat these these schools are financially\nsolvent tell me how will you know if a\nschool or a system or a service that's\nthe provider is financially solvent if\nthey've only been in business one year\nyou absolutely know that most businesses\nfail within the first three years so why\nnot extend it to three years because I'm\ngonna tell you another reason a business\nthat's only been in in operation a year\nfirst of all I want to have financial\nstatements after that first year\nwhen I run my accounting departments I\nend a year is basically on the calendar\nyear December it's the 20th of January\nbefore I can get December closed then\nI've got to come back and reconcile and\nmake sure that I close for the year so\nit's it's February March so and then we\ngot to get to the Auditors y'all there\nis absolutely no reason why we would\nsend our children to a system that has\nnot been proven while they're in a\nsystem that we're contested continuously\ntry to destroy guys come on join me and\nvote no let's get rid of these vouchers\nlet's come together let's fix our public\nschools because I believe in the bottom\nof your heart Public public education\nreally does matter thank you Mr Speaker\nI see you're the well\nlady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Howard is recognized to\nspeak to the bill representative Howard\nwe'll I'll have to representative Howard\nmy my mistake my mistake\nI do have an order\nrepresentative Roman is\nis recognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\num good afternoon colleagues forgive me\nif I Stumble a little bit I have been\nfasting for like 10 hours but\num\nthank you\nso as a freshman we are inundated with\ninformation a lot of times we are told\nhow to vote we're not really 100 sure\nhow to vote sometimes and I completely\nand totally understand that but the\nreality of the situation is that our\ndistrict sent us here and each and every\nsingle one of our districts has unique\nneeds\nand so I'm sharing this map with you\nbecause this map shows what counties are\ngoing to benefit the most and what\ncounties are going to be drained of\nfunding\nlook at that map\nhow many of y'all have districts in blue\nand how many of y'all have districts in\nred\nthe folks in red are seeing a decrease\nin money within those school systems\nso I ask you\nfor those who are asking you to vote Yes\non this bill\ndo they live in the blue county is the\nred counties\nand so I'm not going to take too much\ntime here but I do want to point out\nthat you've heard this argument multiple\ntimes but I wanted to show it to you\nthough that money is going from our\ndistricts to other districts and we need\nto be able to vote for the districts\nthat sent us here because at the end of\nthe day those are the people that we\nhave to answer to and last but not least\nI want to ask you\ndo you really want to vote against one\nof the largest employers in your\nDistrict\nI know I personally don't want to and I\nhope you'll join me as well thank you\nI yield the well lady had lady has\nyielded the well\nrepresenting Ogden Union is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\ncolleagues today I Rise Against SB 233\nas a naturalized U.S citizen recently\nelected to this body I feel it's\nimportant to speak on this matter\nwhich is about to make a historical\nimpact on our future because what we\ndecide today will become a historical\ndocument on how we educated our kids\nI stand here because I'm a product of\npublic education growing up in the UK\nand Nigeria and here in the US my wife\nproud parents of three kids that are\nbenefiting from Gwinnett County Public\nSchools\nlast week I attended the Gwinnett County\nschool board meeting\nand I saw the great job that Dr Calvin\nwatts is doing in growing our specialty\nschools we had updates from a few\nschools we're next schools of\nmathematics Science and Technology\nMaxwell High School International\ntransitions Center the presentations was\none of Promise where a student from each\none of those schools spoke of their\njourney and aspirations because of our\npublic because our public education is\nworking\nI also was proud to see recognitions of\nteachers and Educators at McConnell\nMiddle School\nBrookwood High School and five Fox\nMiddle School\nI myself as an educator\ntaught as an adult instructor in\nCommunity College University I know the\nvalue of a good public education giving\nyou a strong Foundation\nI start by saying this is not a good\nbill\nthis is not a good bill this is not a\ngood bill\nand I say that after citizen education\ncommittee meetings I did not see any\nprovisions for the following items one a\nfiscal note\nyou cannot pass a bill that requires\nfunding without forecasting your\nestimated annual budget I know this\nbecause I've been a strategic planner\nfor over five years\nthe voucher will allocate sixty five\nhundred dollars per student\nsince the author of the bill referenced\nArizona and Indiana that passed similar\nbills I looked up the numbers\nand for those States Arizona spent seven\nthousand dollars on thirty thousand\nstudents which amounted to 200 million\nIndiana spent 5500 on 40 000 students\nwhich amounted to 240 million well let's\ndo the math\nat 6 500 let's do some mathematics we\ntake the average of the both States it\ncomes to about 35 000 people students\nreceiving 6500 multiplied will give you\napproximately 230 million\naccording to the Georgia budget and Pub\npolicy Institute analysis\nthis voucher diverts public funds from\nschools serving majority black students\nand majority living in poverty\nthis is a reminder of Brown versus Board\nof Education which was pivotal and\ndesegregating public schools it made\neducation accessible to all and this\nbill does not\nthis voucher bill\nreduces the amount of funding that our\nPublic Schools could use to support good\nbills like HB 538 the literacy bill\nwhich would cost 80 to 90 million\ndollars\ntwo and a half times less than this\nexpensive voucher bill\nArizona projected that their bill will\ncost them 1.5 billion over the next\ndecade siphoning money away from the\npublic school system the new governor\nis looking to reverse their voucher lore\ntwo fail in schools we talk about our\nPublic Schools failing but there's an\nassumption that all private schools are\npassing schools\nwe should do our due diligence and use\nthe same terms of measurement in testing\nadmission curriculum and retention of\nstudents before trying to allocate\nresources to any private schools\nthe terminology in the bill\nthat families in the bottom 25 according\nto the college career Readiness\nperformance index\nStates the states are currently measure\nwill qualify\n72 of these students are black and over\nhalf are directly certified for free\nlunch\nlet's talk about the laws of probability\na subject that those that like math\nfollow along\nif we take 10\nprivate schools that are passing and\nroughly 50 of those are failing\nand we take five students\nmultiply them by 10 in the schools that\nare passing five good students from from\npublic schools\nwe get 50 students that are likely to\nsucceed\nand then if we say two students from the\nfailing schools we get 2 times 50 which\nis a hundred which is 50 more that are\nlikely to succeed\nbut if we take resources and we allocate\nthem and make those fill in schools\nso-called failing schools passing\nschools\nand we take the same number of five\ntimes fifty and\num\nand for the school we amount to 250\nstudents which is 200 more than those in\nthe private schools\nI say\nwe need to figure out a strategy and sit\ndown and figure out how to increase\nfunding for our schools our Public\nSchools\nlastly I want to stand by saying\nmy naturalized country\nmy punch of origin in Nigeria we have a\nsaying Nigerians never carry last in\nGeorgia we need to have a saying Georgia\nmust always carry first we can only\ncarry first by saying no to SB 233 by\nsaying no by funding uh programs in our\npublic schools by saying no by\nsupporting our kids including\ntransgender kids\nby saying no by supporting bills for us\nkids for school lunches and by saying by\nproviding resources that private schools\nreceive to Public Schools say no on SB\n233 and I yield the well\ngentleman has yielded wet the well\nrepresentative is recognized to speak to\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and and good\nafternoon colleagues I rise today in\nopposition to SB 233 and ask this body\ntwo questions\nhow much time have we actually spent\nlistening to families and children\nattending schools in the bottom 25\npercent and will this bill do the most\ngood for children attending those\nschools in Georgia well I have listened\nI run an education non-profit that\nserves under-resourced high school\nstudents and have been in living rooms\nand sat at kitchen tables to listen to\nour parents our Guardians and most\nimportantly our students\nthe children this bill attempts to serve\nare likely to live in poverty these are\nchildren who lack stable housing\nthese are children who come to school\nwith empty stomachs\nthese are children whose parents work\nmultiple jobs and still feel like\nthey're barely getting by\nto my friends in the chamber who serve\nrural parts of Georgia think about the\nfamilies you work so hard to represent\nand how similar these barriers to access\nare for your District's children\nthe average K-12 private school tuition\nin Georgia is roughly twelve thousand\ndollars\ntwelve thousand dollars almost twice as\nmuch as the voucher in this bill\nprovides\nfor poor families disposable income is\nrare not to mention the short supply of\nquality private schools in rural areas\nof our state\nso who really stands to benefit from\nthis Voucher Program\nthe winners are the privileged few\nfamilies who have the means to make up\nthe tuition difference\nthe losers\nhundreds of thousands of families who\nwill be presented with a choice that is\nvirtually Out Of Reach\nThe Biggest Loser\nGeorgia schools that now have the\nimpossible task of serving a\nconcentrated pool of our most vulnerable\nchildren\ncreate an even more impossible\nconditions for improvement and success\nSB 233 will severely harm these public\nschools by diverting public funds to\nprivate schools making it harder to\nrecruit and retain teachers pay for much\nneeded social workers and guidance\ncounselors\nsupport mental health services offer\nfree and reduced lunch and provide\nquality after school program among other\ndifficulties\nis this really the best solution for our\nchildren\nthis past December there was a tragic\nshooting at Atlantic Station that took\nthe lives and futures of two children a\n12 and a 15 year old a few weeks later I\nvisited with the student in my program\nwho was shot in the leg that night\nher mother Harriet was by her side while\nwe shared breakfast and discussed ways\nto ensure that these tragedies stop\noccurring\nI asked my student why are these things\nhappening and what can I do to help\nshe said we need more\nmore after school programs\nmore teachers who are supported and stay\nmore counselors who listen and help\nshe said she looks around and feels like\nit doesn't matter her school her future\nand sometimes even her life\nback in 2019 a similar voucher bill was\nproposed and it would have required 48\nmillion from taxpayers in year one\nrising to a maximum of over a half\nbillion dollars in 10 years\nwe should not be diverting resources to\nsupport private interests that undermine\nGeorgia's public schools especially our\nschools most in need that need more not\nless\nlet's move Beyond false hope and false\nchoices in favor of better outcomes for\nour underserved children and families\nand vote no to SB 233 thank you Mr\nSpeaker\ngentlemen is yielded the well\nrepresentative parishes recommend is\nrecognized to speak\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues I rise\ntoday to quickly speak to you about\nSenate Bill 233\nbecause specifically I want to address\nhow School vouchers hurt George's\nfamilies School vouchers are government\nsubsidized scholarships that put private\nschools ahead of public schools the idea\nseems good that vouchers provide\nfamilies with more choices when they're\nwhen it comes to their children's\neducation however in reality School\nvouchers have been shown to have\nnegative consequences particularly for\nmost Georgia families instead of\nassisting most Georgia families this is\na gift to our most well-off Georgians\none of the biggest problems I have with\nschool vouchers is that they divert\npublic funds away from public schools I\nliken it to in committee I talked about\nhow you know it's like if you got a\nhouse and your house has got an\nelectrical problem it's ten thousand\ndollars to fix the electrical problem\ninstead of you taking that ten thousand\ndollars and fixing the house you go and\nrent an expensive high-class apartment\nand decide oh going to live in this now\nyou got both of them to pay for so we're\nat a place where we really need to make\nsure that we take care of George's\nchildren\nwhen you look at the data that is direct\nthat is there is a direct correlation\nbetween the number of students who are\nliving in poverty and our school's\nachievement scores instead of diverting\nmoney away from our Public Schools we\nshould be investing in them just like\nHouse Bill 538 uh takes us when Public\nSchools lose funding it's the students\nand the teachers who suffer we know that\nwe are facing huge challenges in teacher\nrecruitment Georgia's public school\nteachers already regularly come out of\ntheir own pocket to pay for many things\nSB 233 would provide 65 000 6500 in\nGeorgia taxpayer funds to subsidize a\nstudent's private school tuition cost\nthat will not do it it's cost like ten\nto twelve thousand dollars to go to Pub\na private school poor people do not have\nthat kind of money I Know You Know Rich\npoor and uh below 20 poor they're two\ndifferent pores everyone\num there are zero Financial\naccountability in this bill either\nfor the private schools that stand to\nbenefit from them or from the parents\nwho will receive the 65 hundred dollar\nchecks each year this money could be\nused for a child to attend a school that\nis not fully accredited whose teachers\nare not even required to hold a\nfour-year degree and much less an\neducation degree\nI'm going to get to the end of this\nfinally I must repeat that school\nvouchers do not address the root causes\nof poor educational outcomes families\nface many challenges that we as the\nGeorgia state house can address which\naffect their children's education such\nas poverty lack of Access to Health Care\nand unstable housing these issues cannot\nbe solved by simply sending a child to a\ndifferent school instead we need to\nfully and equally invest in our public\nschools and support families so that\nthey can provide their children with not\nonly a quality education but the basic\nsupport all children need to be\nsuccessful in conclusion School vouchers\nin Georgia hurt our most vulnerable\nfamilies they divert funds public funds\naway from public schools come with\nhidden costs and are not accountable to\nthe same standards as public schools\nlead\nthey lead to increased segregation\nI'll repeat that they lead to increased\nsegregation and do not address the root\ncauses of poor educational outcomes SB\n233 is wrong for our schools wrong for\nour families and wrong for our state\ninstead of supporting School vouchers we\nshould invest in public schools and\nsupporting families so that all children\nhave access to a quality education thank\nyou Mr Speaker and I feel the well\nlady has yielded the well\nnow representative guy\nyou're recognized and speak to the Bill\nthank you for your patience\nthank you Mr Speaker\nand to my colleagues that are gathered\nin the room today\nI Rise to oppose this bill this voucher\nbill\n233\nand I'll do that for many reasons\nfirst of all\nI don't think the bill will accomplish\nwhat the author's good intentions of\nhelping those who are economically\ndisadvantaged according to line 33 in\nthe bill\nI've spoken over the last few days\nwith friends and closer and one close\nrelative\nwhose household household income\nis in the mid six figures\nmid six figures they in 200 300 000\nannual household income\nand I will tell you today that they are\nchopping at the bits\nbecause they see this sixty five hundred\ndollars coming\nand they want to take advantage of it\nwhich is ridiculous because it's not\ndesigned even though they are close\nrelatives of mine it's not designed for\nthose children who can afford School\nprivate school as a matter of fact as a\nmatter of fact one of these uh\nindividuals uh that child is in pre-k\nnow and has been approved and\naccepted to a private school for\nkindergarten but if this bill passes\nthey're going to qualify for this\nvoucher which again I think is\nridiculous\nit's not accomplished it's contrary to\nwhat I think the intentions are the good\nintentions of the authors have\nthat's one of my objectives that's one\nof my concerns but a greater concern is\nthat this voucher Bill s b 233 it allows\nprivate schools to accept taxpayer\ndollars while according to lines 181\nthrough 183 they can maintain Creeds\npractices and admissions policies that\nhas the potential of prohibiting and\ndenying admissions to qualified students\nand I think that is called\ndiscrimination\nthirdly it is my understanding that\nprivate school teachers are not held to\nthe same standards as public school\nteachers as it relates to certifications\nif that be the case how can we justify\nusing State taxpayer funds to pay their\nsalaries when at the same time we are\ncutting budgets for paraprofessionals\nand debating about whether to fund\nliteracy coaches\nthis is a bad Bill\nwith no fiscal note\nand unspecified accountability\nit's bad because rural Georgia where\ncounties where there are no private\nschools\nthose young people will have no options\nif we want to improve and help the\nstudents in Georgia why not give this\nsame Financial considerations with\naccountability to our Public Schools it\nis for all of these reasons and many\nmore that time will not permit me to to\ndiscuss that I would not vote for this\nbill and I would ask you to do the same\namen\namen\nthe gentleman's time has expired\nand he has yielded the well now we'll\nmove on the time has expired now we'll\nmove on to the uh those speaking in\nfavor\nchair recognizes representative Hilton\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and distinguished\ncolleagues today I rise in full support\nof Senate bill 233.\nSenate Bill 233 provides a critical\nLifeline of Hope\nacross our state to families who are\ntrapped in failing schools\npublic education as we've heard is not\nan either or proposition\nwe can both give families school choice\nwhile also focusing our continued\nefforts to support public education this\nis not an either this is not an or this\nis an and\nwhy are we here today\nthis is the farthest an Esa bill has\ngotten the farthest\nand I would submit to you it's because\nfor the better part of four years\npoliticians\nhave been telling families sit down\nwe've got this we know best in your\nchild's education and for the better\npart of four years those politicians\nhave been voted out of office by those\nparents who say no we know what's best\nin our child's education\nthis moment is a historic opportunity\nfor our state to take a steps towards\nmodernizing our education system\nallowing parents to the power to choose\nand customize an education that fits\nbest their own child's needs instead of\na top-down\none-size-fits-all system we can move\ntogether in a Grassroots approach that\nis inclusive and respects the dignity\nand unique Gifts of every single child\nsome students need specialized attention\na different teaching method a specific\nCurriculum by giving families more\noptions we are not only improving\neducational opportunities but we're\ngiving every child an equal opportunity\nto succeed\nas you know Georgia is home to some of\nthe best schools in the nation I would\nbe remiss if I did not recognize our\nincredible teachers and administrators\nwho are on the front lines fighting for\nour children every day\npersonally I am the product of both\npublic and private education and I'm\neternally grateful for the teachers in\nmy life\nand I'm grateful my parents had the\nchoice\nbut unfortunately not every child in\nGeorgia has that choice\nas the chair of the education policy\nsubcommittee I can tell you that public\neducation has never been more funded in\nthe history of our state\nQBE is fully funded\nwe are now consistently giving teachers\nmuch needed pay raises\nand public schools have significant\nreserves on hand totaling almost six\nbillion dollars on their balance sheet\nin our committee we heard heartbreaking\ntestimony from students and parents who\nare Desperately Seeking a lifeline\nwe heard from a young student\nwho literally has rats\nrats y'all falling from the ceiling\nthat's problematic\nbut here's what's really problematic\nthat school system has a hundred million\ndollars in reserve and rats are running\nthrough the school\nwe heard from a mother who wanted to\nsend her son to a local micro school\nwith a cost of eighty five hundred\ndollars a year\nshe was so desperate to get her son a\nbetter education\nshe went out into her community and\nliterally knocked on doors asking for\nmoney for her child\nbusinesses and individuals stepped up\nand she raised money for her son to have\na better life\non an almost routine basis we see on\nsocial media videos of kids fighting\nteachers and dangerous conditions in\nschools\nthis does not need to happen\nSB 233 allows students to escape these\nconditions while also giving us the\nflexibility to address needs in\neducation\nif you're like me you've heard you've\nreceived dozens of emails on Senate Bill\n233 let's walk through real quick three\nmyths and three realities\nmyth number one Senate Bill 233\ndefunds public education\nhere is the fact\npublic education is funded by three\nbuckets local state and federal dollars\nunder SB 233 State dollars will follow\nyour student while local school systems\nget to keep their local share without\nthe associated expense\nall school systems\nwill benefit financially from this when\ntheir children take advantage of this\nprogram\nmyth number two Senate Bill 233 lacks\naccountability I want to applaud\nchairman Irwin\nchairman Jones chairman dubnick leader\nWade This House made significant\nimprovements to this bill already a\ngreat bill that came over from the\nSenate to add even more accountability\nannual audits annual testing annual\ngraduation rates student data based on\ngrade level gender and race the student\nfinance commission will have the\nauthority to conduct random audits on\nannual basis\nand monitor the in fiscal Integrity of\nthis program\nany evidence of fraud can be turned over\nto the Attorney General's office for\nprosecution\nthis is tight we have it on lockdown\nfinally myth number three\nSenate Bill 233 does not benefit our\nrural community\nfact\nthe reality is that there are private\nschools and almost every County of our\nstate\nthe beauty of an Esa program\nis an Esa is more flexible\nallowing students to benefit from online\nlearning programs\nhome study programs and even dual\nenrollment\nin this bill there are literally\nopportunities for every child in every\ncorner of our state\nnow I know one no matter what I say\nthere are going to be Skeptics out there\nschool choice is about giving every\nchild a chance to succeed regardless of\ntheir background or social economic\nstatus\nbut let's not look just to Georgia let's\nlook to Florida\nthey've had an Esa program in place for\nyears and guess what happened\nthat program is so successful this past\nweek\ntheir Senate and House overwhelmingly on\na bipartisan basis expanded their\nexisting program\nI know we're afraid here to do it but if\nwe do it here in Georgia I can almost\nguarantee you we're going to be right\nback here in a few years because this\nprogram is going to be that successful\nas we've seen in Florida\nin closing I believe that every child\ndeserves the best education possible\nand I trust I trust that parents know\nwhat's best for their child and that's\nwhy we need to empower parents\nand put them in the driver's seat of\ntheir child's education\nso I ask you let's work together\nfor a brighter future for our children\nI urge you to vote Yes on Senate Bill\n233\nand with that Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell\nthe gentlemen has yielded the well\nrepresentative Wade is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you\nare you ready\nrepresentative Wade is recognized\nthank you speaker\nladies and gentlemen I appreciate\nyou all being here and um\nthis is a special day for me because\nI have an opportunity to speak to you as\na person who is advocated on behalf of\npublic education\nfor over 16 years as a school board\nmember in Dawson County schools and by\nthe way that is in rural\nGeorgia\neven the kids like to say we keep it\nrural there if you know what I mean\nit's okay I know it's a dad joke but I\ngot kids that are six and nine so that's\nhow I roll right now\nit's late I'm tired\nI'm ready to get home it's my 20th\nanniversary today\nso\nlet me tell you to a public educated a\npublic education teacher and\nadministrator\nshe's in her 22nd year\nI am a son of two teachers\nI was in a public school kindergarten\nthrough third to 12th grade 13 years of\nmy life\nfolks\nwe are a state that has fully funded QBE\nfor the last five years\nQB is currently fully funded\nthe public school ecosystem has never\nhad as much money in total as well as\nper student ever in our state's history\nI am for public education\nthere are superintendents there are\nteachers there are folks that are\ntexting you they're emailing you with\nconcerns and I respect those concerns\nbut I also want you to remember that our\njob as a state legislature\nand what my belief and what I believe\nmany of you on both the right and the\nleft or the Republican side or the\nDemocratic side believe is that\neducation is the most important thing\nand every single child deserves the best\noption\nnow at the same time that we have fully\nfunded education in this state we have\nseen major improvements in many areas\nbut if we're all being completely honest\nwith one another\nwe also could acknowledge that all\nacross this state there are some\nchildren\nthat are not receiving\nthe best and folks I believe that every\nchild in this state deserves the best\neducational opportunity and that\necosystem needs to acknowledge what we\ndid with special needs\nI was told by folks that have been here\nback when the sb10 and sb47 bill was\npassed that it would decimate\nthe public education sector in the state\nand I look I understand\nwe all have concerns about something new\nbut that program has served a vital\npurpose for over 5500 special needs\nstudents some of the most fragile Among\nUs\nand it is not crippled the school\nsystems in this state in fact I would\nargue that has helped the schools serve\nthe students that are still in their\ndistricts who have those special needs\nthey are getting better service because\nthe students that weren't being met are\nno longer causing the issue for those\nstudents that remain\nI also want to speak to you from this\nregard and I'll be short but I want you\nto really hear me\nchoice\nis important\nin the 21st century we have to ensure\nthat children have the best options\nwe have narrowly tailored this bill and\nI would argue that this is the most\nwell thought out balanced Approach at\nthis issue to ensure that we are doing\nthings in this state that will give us\nthe opportunity to compare how a student\nperforms it receives this scholarship\nversus a student that is in our\nclassrooms it is helping those students\nin which when I was on the gsba\nboard and I was a president who traveled\nthis state to many of the parts of this\nstate who have schools that are in the\nlowest 25 percent of performance when\nthose mothers and grandmothers were\ncoming to me saying I need another\noption\nI love my community I love my teachers I\nlove my principal they're just not\ngetting the job done\nthat's real talk I get it\nthese folks need an option\nto those school systems who have one or\ntwo schools in their District that are\non this list\nwe already have an opportunity for you\nat home to provide intra District\ntransfers for those families that want\nto go to another school\nwithin your own District but I have\nheard from parents and community members\nthat they have been told that that's not\nan option for them the adults cannot\nfigure it out they can't make that work\nthat concerns me as a person that\nbelieves that every child needs to\nreceive an opportunity to best\nmeet their expectations for their young\nones\nfolks\nI'll wrap up with this\nI hope if you are a person who's in this\nbuilding that is struggling with this\nchoice\nthat you'll think about children and not\nadults\nI think I hope that you will realize\nthat this is going to be the next step\nin ensuring that Georgia provides every\nchild the best opportunity\nto grow and to thrive\nI'm honored to be a floor leader for\ngovernor Kemp\nI've enjoyed being able to be a part of\nthat\neffort Governor Kemp is fully funded\neducation with the legislature's help\nGovernor Kemp appreciates the work\nof this legislation and Governor Kemp\nsupports this bill\nI hope that you will give that your\nhighest regard because he is a governor\nwho has done much for the public\nstudents public school children in this\nstate and children in every corner with\nthat I hope you will cast your vote Yes\nand I yield the well thank you\nrepresentative Maynor is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you chair and good afternoon\ncolleagues\nI don't know if this bill is going to\npass or not but I do think it's\nimportant for us to talk about it all of\nus are here so let's talk about the\nelephant in the room\nthe schools and some are failing some\nare not\nEphesians 1 16 says I do not cease to\ngive thanks\nfor you that was the lent prayer I did\nyesterday at my church\nJesus we're in Lent Jesus spent 40 days\nin the wilderness seeking discernment we\nare here at the capitol for 40 days\nfor 40 days we need to discern the\nvoices of 60 000 people\nwe sit Rock and swivel in our leather\nleather antique chairs\nunder an actual gold Dome\nand we debate on what is good for the\npeople of Georgia\nthink about what the kids\nin failing school environments are\nthankful for\nwhat is a six-year-old child selling\nwater at a busy intersection with his 14\nyear old brother thankful for\nwhat about the little girl\nwho has two parents in prison what is\nshe thankful for\nsixty thousand people are counting on us\nto not be bipartisan\nthey assume based on our party line\nwe will think like them but we will\nalways defer to their needs over our\nparty's needs\nnow Jesus ultimately did die\nafter those 40 days but he rose again\nMaybe sb233\nmay give a child an opportunity to rise\nI got a call from a constituent that's a\nveteran\nthey said rut Manor remember we don't\nleave anyone behind please vote Yes for\nSB 233 every child deserves a chance\nwhen I came here I found out quite\nquickly\nthat education was as partisan as Donald\nTrump\nlobbyists that are against this bill\nthey roll their eyes at me when they see\nme\nthis bill makes people mad and angry\nand they show it to you\nnow like children in marginalized\ncommunities just like the one that I\ngrew up in\nparents only know what they know\nand if you're in an environment\nin a failing school it's quite possible\nthat the parents you're right that is\nsome of the argument with some people\nyou're very right parents may not know\nhow to access\nthis resource\nchildren across Georgia the whole\nconversation today has been about money\nmoney money money money money money\nmoney\na child is a dollar sign I don't think a\nchild is a dollar sign\nchildren are thirteen thousand dollars\nroughly\nsix thousand per child from the state\nand roughly seven thousand from other\nsources\nnow when you go home\nyou have plenty of options children in\nunfortunate situations have no options\nin Atlanta I have the highest energy\nburden District in the city and that\nmeans there are families that don't even\nhave utilities on\nhow do they do homework without even\nutilities\nso imagine you don't have utilities you\ngo to the same school in your\nenvironment\nhow would your eyes open up if you went\nto another environment when I was little\nI used to go to the downtown library it\nwas so big it was massive\nbecause when I got off of the school bus\nI ran home from crackheads\nso when I went to the library I thought\nI was somewhere amazing and to this day\nI value education because\nof my experience of going somewhere I\nhad never been before a library a public\nlibrary\nchildren walk into schools every day\nand on the board it says welcome to your\nschool and the schools have their\naverages up there so imagine a child\nwalking into school every day and it\nsays welcome we are a d school we are in\nF School\nis that going to make them want to do\nmore\nsb233 is for students students in\nschools that are listed in the bottom 25\nperformance level of all Georgia schools\nthat is a lot of schools in my district\nin fact I have the most charter schools\nin my district than any other District\nin the state because parents are looking\nfor options\nsupporting SB 233 doesn't mean you don't\nsupport teachers in fact I think\nteachers put their lives in danger every\nsingle day as well as the school bus\ndrivers that we learned\nsb233 is not against public schools it's\nabout giving a child an opportunity\neverybody is not going to run and use\nthis resource but if one child uses it\nimagine if it was me if one child uses\nit it has made a difference for one\nchild\nmy mom used someone else's address so I\ncould go to another school on another\nside of town\nnow imagine I don't know where I would\nbe if I went to the school in my\nneighborhood I really don't\nthe Georgia Chamber released the report\nsaying that Georgia has a labor\nworkforce issue\nimagine if we were\nusing our creativity\nin the schools that we have right now\nbut we aren't because guess what right\nnow the schools are using curriculums\nthat are not preparing children for\ntoday's activities\nin 1906 we started this system for\nfactory workers the Bell System came\nalive we are past the Bell System we're\npast children sitting in a desk\none plus one equals two we are now at in\nother countries their Pre-K students are\nlearning robotics\nthe issue is not\nnecessarily we're trying to take money\naway from public schools what we're\ntrying to do hopefully what this will do\nis just\nmake schools\ndo something different\nwe're using the QB formula has been the\nQBE formula for a long time everybody\nknows that that formula is outdated\nright\nbut what do we do about it\nright now our budget for education is 12\nbillion dollars that's the same\noperating budget as McDonald's\nnow if you went to McDonald's every day\nand got a burnt hamburger and burnt\nFries Are You Gonna keep going back to\nthat McDonald's\nI know that leader Beverly said no he's\nnot going\nand that's what the children are saying\nI don't want to go where the burnt\nhamburger is I don't want to go where\nthe burnt Fries Are\nI want a fresh hamburger I want a fresh\neducation I want something different\njust give me something different I am\nactually screaming because I am the\nchild that will benefit from this there\nare some things that are not all the way\nright for this and we can fix that later\nbut if one child one child can benefit\nfrom this then you should vote for sb233\nand for all the lobbyists you do not\nhave to roll your eyes at me when you\nsee me\nbecause it's good it's another subject\nthat might come up that you we might\nagree on but just because we don't agree\non this and this is for my colleagues\ntoo you do not have to treat me so badly\nbecause I am trying to help the children\nin my community and speaker I yield the\nwill\nlady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Martinez is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nMr Speaker you know we're uh we're\nhearing all the representatives today\nlet me tell you another group that this\nuh this bill helps my people the\nHispanic Community the Latinos in\nGeorgia the tenth of thousand students\nlet me tell you Mr Speaker and I'm going\nto be very brief because I know we got\nmore speakers and it's getting late\nI love coming here to the well also\nand telling the people especially the\nHispanic Community some good news\nas a Latino\nthat came to this country when I was a\nboy\nI went to a failing school I went to a\npublic school\nI also went through ESO esol classes you\nguys know what ESO is all right I'm sure\nyou do I've been there I've been there\nI'm a product of this bill\nI'm a product that's a spell coming to\nthis country when I was a young boy\nfor the for my Hispanic community\nespecially the Latino kids\nstruggling\nin schools\nit gives my people\nmy community a choice\nisn't that what we always talk about\nchoice\nMr Speaker I am pro-school choice\nmy only regret\nis not having this option\nwhen I was a student\nthat's my only regret I wish my parents\nhad this option in the early 80s when I\ncame to this beautiful country\nand without Mr Speaker I hear the will\nthank you\nthe gentleman has shielded the well\nthat concludes all of those that are\nopposed\nand in favor\nwith the time that there was allotted to\nthem\nnow we'll move on to the Minority Report\nbut first\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered chair here's none\nthe previous question is ordered\nnow we'll move on to the Minority Report\nand the chairs time 20 minutes for each\nI'll recognize representative David\nWilkerson\nto speak to the bill and he can allocate\nthe time as he sees fit there's a couple\nother speakers I think you're aware of\nthat\nrepresentative wilkerson's recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker\num I rise today to speak to the Minority\nReport to SB 233 uh\nI know that we all the kids are the most\nimportant thing I this is my first year\nserving an education committee and I've\nbeen very excited that we've talked\nabout safety and literacy and this\nreally is a discussion on what is the\nbest way to make sure the kids are\ngetting the education they need\nwe talk a lot about\nfully funding QB so I'm going to walk\nthrough the parts of the bill real quick\nit is correct that this bill has not\nbecome effective until QBE is fully\nfunded\nhowever once we start the process\nit never stops\nso whether QBE stops being funded we're\ngoing to continue to fund this\nthe second thing is we are funding a\nformula from 1985. I'm going to date\nmyself but if you go back to 1985 the\ntop movie was Back to the Future Beverly\nHills Cop Rambo Rocky and Cocoon\nif you could tell me what cocoon was\nabout then I'll give you extra credit\nbut the bottom line is we're funding a\nformula that educated kids in 90 1985\nand a lot of very smart people have said\nthat that formula does not work\nso we've made a lot of changes to this\nbill as we went through the education\ncommittee but if you go to line three\nthere's been a lot of debate about what\nis QBE funding is this enough is this\ntoo much or whatever\nthe sixty five hundred dollars that were\nallocating to QBE is 6 500 no matter\nwhat we do to QBE as far as austerity\ncuts\nso my plea is that if we're going to do\nthis which I hope we don't that we say\nyou can get funding up to 6 500 not to\nexceed what QBE is\num that would be one request to change\nthe second thing is as far as qualifying\nfor the bill if you go to line 73 this\nis all driven by parents and this is not\ngoing to be a large number of students\nhowever if your parents live in another\nstate and say you're a married student\nyour military you're married if your\nparents are in the military you still\nqualify for this if your spouse is\nmilitary you do not qualify for this\nscholarship so we're going to be leaving\nout anybody who moves here that is\nmarried to a service member 21 year old\nthat's married to an 18 year old Etc\nthey will be excluded from this I have a\nquestion about foster children will they\nbe included because foster parents or\nnot I mean I'm in the in the in the in\nthe system they may or may not be\nincluded so I just have a question about\nthat and I'll leave it to the authors\nthe big thing though for me is if you\nlook at the board on the left and\nforgive my writing but if you look at\nthe board on the left that's a fiscal\nnote\nit's done by the professionals down here\nat the Capitol they talk about what this\nbill will do whether it's going to cost\nus or whether it won't cost us\non the right is the only type of fiscal\nnote that I've seen and so if you look\nin the bottom left-hand Corner that's my\nfiscal calculation for the meeting today\nyou'll see where I started with the 6\n500 and I backed out mathematically what\nQBE funding is for a 9th through 12th\ngrader and I get about thirty six\nhundred dollars I took one of the school\nsystems and I said okay say only 10 of\nthat school system uses the voucher\nthat's that's 50 students if 50 students\nuse that voucher you potentially have\nthe state spending 180 000 more than\nthey did\num and so that's 500 times 10 and if you\nlook at the top right that's some other\nnotes that I had but the bottom line is\nwhether you like this bill or not we\nneed to know the cost because what we're\ndoing is obligating money to students\nmaking promises to families that we will\nhave to continue going forward forever\nand if we don't know what the cost now\nhow can we make that promises to\nfamilies that their kids will have that\nfunding to go to private school so with\nthat I will yield the remainder of my\ntime to other speakers but I ask us to\nplease get a fiscal note to make sure we\nknow what the promise we're making so\nmake sure we can keep them thank you\ngentleman has yielded the well\nrepresentative Lisa Campbell is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nrepresentative Campbell\nspeaker\ncolleagues we've all been hearing many\nvoices today about this bill but I Rise\nto speak against Senate bill 233.\nbecause I believe investing in our\npublic education is the single most\nimportant thing we can do to improve the\nlives of all Georgians\nI urge everyone to consider voting for\nthree main reasons number one this bill\ntakes public funds and hands them over\nto private entities\nwithout accountability that protects\nparents and kids there's no getting\naround that\nwe've talked a lot about the Hope\nScholarship a smart investment in our\nstudents and this bill uses the same\nterm scholarship\nbut do not be fooled this is not a\nscholarship program using new funds as\nwith the lottery in this bill taxpayer\ndollars are deducted from our local\npublic schools QBE allocations that's\nwhere they're coming from and they are\nhanded out to private entities\nthis bill proposes a sixty five hundred\ndollar taxpayer funded private school\ntuition subsidy\nthe average full-time equivalent for\nmiddle school student allocation in\nGeorgia is about 2 900 bucks in this\nbill we're giving twice that much money\nto private schools and to homeschoolers\ntwice as much than our Public Schools\nget for that same child\nand even more alarming is the fact that\nopting out of public education means\nparticipating parents will also forego\nprotections for students with\ndisabilities\nbackground checks for teachers\nSchool accreditation and they have very\nlittle assurance that the private school\nthey've selected will even accept their\nchild or will be a viable program\nthis bill lacks oversight as the new\ncommission is not required to report the\ndemographics of students at the\nindividual participating schools the\nassessment results attendance course\ncompletion or even high school\ngraduation rates\nan itemized list of expenditures\napproved by is not required either from\nthe parent Review Committee\nnumber two this bill dilutes funding for\nour local public schools who are already\ntrying to make up for 30 years of\nunderfunded budgets\nproponents of this bill have said local\nschool districts won't lose money\nbecause the money is following the child\nthat is simply not true each district\nwould receive 6 500 less per student in\ntheir allocated QBE funds there's no cap\nto the number of students who can\nparticipate no cap for a family and no\ncap on the length of the voucher program\nit could be used for 12 years\nfor each student for a whopping seventy\neight thousand dollars per child did\ny'all hear that\neach child each family could get seventy\neight thousand dollars for their child\nthat is coming from our Public School\nbudgets wealthy districts are hurt less\nthan poor but all public schools will\nlose State money to the tune of about\n210 million dollars sucked out of our\nPublic Schools budgets annually and\nwe're now already seeing the\ncatastrophic results from taking more\nthan 11 billion dollars from our public\nschools in the last 30 years\nI'm here to tell you 30 million dollars\nis not fully funding Public School in\nany way shape or form and lastly and no\none has talked about this much yet I\nthink this is absolutely critical number\nthree voucher programs are known to\ndecrease student outcomes\nthey decrease student outcomes\nthat's the intention of this program\nright to improve our students education\nbut the reality is that vouchers are not\na new brilliant idea they've been tried\nin other states\nand when they have they're proven to\nactually decrease achievement\nthat's right subsidizing private school\ndoes not improve student outcomes and in\nthe long-term studies the long-term\nstudies that have been conducted has\nactually decreased the outcomes\nrepeated studies about your programs\nacross the country show that vouchers\nresult in worse test programs in\nMilwaukee Cleveland the District of\nColumbia\nand they found that students who receive\nvouchers showed no improvement in\nreading or math over those not in the\nprogram\nother studies conducted by Fordham\nUniversity the U.S Department of\nEducation The Brookings Institute and\nothers show long-term voucher programs\ncause a decline in academic achievement\nthat rivals or even exceeds those caused\nby natural disasters including the\ncovid-19 pandemic\nI don't know if y'all are hearing this\nbut after aggregating the test scores\nfor voucher participants in Indiana\nLouisiana Ohio Washington one of these\nresearch described the results as some\nof the biggest drops we've ever seen in\ntest scores in the research community\nthe worst scores there's AV you we are\nadvocating for a change for Innovation\nbut I don't think reduced outcomes is\nthe change we're looking for\nrather than voting for this bill we\ncould do new things instead unite and\ninvest in fully funding pre-K in\nkindergarten research shows that that\nactually does improve our outcomes\nproviding for professional salaries to\nattract and retrain College quality\nteachers\nyou want to get to a lower classroom\nratio let's hire some more teachers\nfunding literacy curriculum to improve\nour embarrassing 40-second ranking this\nyear and increase professional learning\nfor educators and fund our high quality\ncurriculum\nthis bill does not diminish the rights\nof parents to send their kids to the\nschools of their choice they can still\ndo that but it does in fact diminish our\nPublic Schools and I have to say this\nafternoon it has been quite Rich to hear\ntalk about the importance of choice\nbut our choice is to fund education for\nall kids not just some\nand as the great granddaughter of two\nPublic School teachers\nthe granddaughter of a Cobb County\nPublic School teacher for more than 20\nyears and the daughter of a high school\nchemistry teacher I urge you to vote no\non Senate Bill 233 thank you Mr Speaker\nand I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresented Becky Evans\nhas recognized to speak to the bill\nthank you thank you Mr Speaker\ngood afternoon colleagues\nI rise today in opposition to Senate\nBill 233\nThe Spill would send public funds to our\nprivate schools\nwith little accountability for the\nperformance of private schools limited\ntransparency\nand no estimate no estimate\nof the program costs\nI want to talk about money and values\nwe're saying it is it is about money and\nI think it's because you know our state\nand our budget it's our priorities it's\nour budget reflects our priorities as a\nstate\nand it is true that education is the\nlargest proportion of our budget I\nrecognize that and I'm very grateful for\nthat\nbut I want to talk about what we're\nchoosing to fund and what we're not\nchoosing to fund with this bill\nyes it is true that we have fully funded\nQBE for the past four years and we're\nI'm grateful for that\nbut as we've heard earlier QBE hasn't\nbeen uh updated in over 30 years\nand we know that there are so many\nthings that are a part of educating our\nchildren that QBE does not support\nat the beginning of this session in the\neducation committee I remember\nwe had excellent speakers talking to us\nabout what we need what we need to do to\nimprove education we heard from the\nGeorgia partnership and excellence in\neducation\none of the things they talked about was\nthe need for more counselors and in this\nbudget we appear to be poised to fund\ncounselors for special education and\ngifted students so that's good that's\none challenge I want to see if that\nactually makes it in the budget but\nothers remain counselors are funded at a\nratio of one counselor to 450 students\nabove the one to 250 students\nrecommended by the American counselor\nAssociation\nwe need these counselors so that our\nstudents can have guidance on their\nCollege and Career pathways\nthis body has recognized our 48th or\n49th ranking of those providing Mental\nHealth Services to Georgians\nthe mental health parity Act and the\nyears of expansion this year's expansion\nof Behavioral Health reforms that's I'm\nhoping that will pass and I'm grateful\nfor that\nbut in our schools our state funds\nSchool social workers and one and school\npsychologists one for every 2\n475 students\nand that is above the recommended ratio\nof 1 to 250 students for social workers\nand one to five hundred for school\npsychologists\nanother thing is Georgia is one of the\nsix states that doesn't provide extra\nfunding for low-income students through\nthe K-12 funding formula\nwe learned that that we need to provide\na poverty way this was recommended to us\nand several of our legislators have\nrecommended that and that's something\nwe're choosing not to fund\nTransportation costs we learned that the\nportion of student transportation costs\ncovered by the state has shrunk from 50\npercent in the 90s to less than 15\npercent annually\nthis expense which also which often\nFalls harder on Rural districts limits\nthe district's Investments of local\nfunds into the classroom\nthese yeah so I want to just for take a\nlook for us up at the map we could talk\nabout all these other ways we're not\nfunding schools\nbut I want to take a look here\num\nat this map you see on the board and\nthis is a map of where we have uh\nprivate schools\nin Georgia\nand if you take a look at the map 50 uh\nthe white part is where there are no\num private schools in Georgia the yellow\nis where there's one private school so\nwe need to talk about who will this bill\nbenefit will it benefit\nthe students in rural Georgia who need\nwho who are who\nand I think you look at that Mom you say\nhow how will this bill benefit the\nstudents of rural Georgia when I look at\nthat map\nthe other question about QBE is yes this\nthe bill States uh QBE needs to be\nfunded in order for this to be\nimplemented but what about if we go into\nrecession what will happen with that\nwill we go uh will QBE\nbe funded or will our private schools be\nfunded what will our choice be\nso we've talked about the the sixty five\nhundred dollars that we're spending per\nstudent what this program will cost\nand you've heard estimates of cost from\nother uh from other uh uh people\nspeaking to this bill\nbut I do want to\nhave us think about\nwhat we've done with uh our voucher\nprograms before we currently uh the the\neducation scholarship\nthe tax credit scholarship that started\nat 58 million we've bumped that up to\n120 million\nthe\nthis the the the scholarship for\nstudents with edu uh yeah\nwe've also we're at 30 million for\num\nfor the the students with disabilities\nscholarship what will this increase to\nthat is what we don't know all right\nstudents thank you thank you everyone\nI ask that you please\ndo not vote for this bill let's fully\nfund all these other things instead of\nfunding\nprivate schools for children where we\nhave no accountability thank you Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nthat completes the Minority Report\nnow we'll have the chairs time\nchair has up to 20 minutes for\nChairman's time\nwe're now recognize the chairman from\nwhich this bill came chairman Irwin\nfor the Chairman's

is\nrecognized to speak to the bill well\nthank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr\nchairman and I appreciate your efforts\non this legislation\nI'm just going to make a couple sort of\noff the cuff

at students in public schools\nteachers in public schools including\npublic charter schools and\num\nand and this is the first time and some\nmight ask well why did you decide to get\ninvolved and it's because it's it's\nbecome clear as over these 20 years that\nour state and our constituents and in\nparticular after covet a couple years of\ndisruption\nthere are some of them that would like\nanother option\nand it's not a rejection of public\nschool usually it's you know family of\nthree and maybe it's just not quite\nworking for one you know maybe one\ndoesn't quite fit in we have public\nschools\nwith 3 000 students in them you know\nthat's just not for everyone and I'm not\nsure we should play King Solomon and be\nthe ones to decide what you know where\nyou're going to go and I um but I don't\nI don't see it as either you're\nsupporting Public Schools or you're\nsupporting other options because it's\nnot just private schools it's these\nmicro schools that have emerged and and\nhomeschoolers who don't really fit the\nmodel or what we thought of 20 years ago\nis sort of your traditional\nhomeschoolers sometimes it's there's\nsort of your average mom sometimes it's\nthe dad who finds that one of their two\nkids it's just not quite working and you\nknow their children come first to them\nand who better to know that than the\nparent and so after 20 years of um\nI I've worked particularly on you all\nknow public charter schools but I\ninitiated the dual enrollment with the\nmove on when ready because you know\nthat's really just another option that\nby the way also uses private colleges\nto provide needed services to students\nbecause sometimes the high school just\ndoesn't one size fit all and I haven't\nreally found that dual enrollment to be\nparticularly\ncontroversial\nI worked on Hope Scholarship to\nallow students who take stem classes the\nvery challenging stem classes to fulfill\nneeded careers that they would receive\nextra weight while they're in college\nsort of akin to dual enrollment and AP\nweight oh and by the way at private\ncolleges and public colleges where\nstudents are on hope so I I think it's\num\nmischaracterize it to say that you have\nto be for one or the other because\nserving on the education committee under\nsome awesome education chairs including\nBrooks Coleman former assistant\nsuperintendent of Gwinnett County or\nsuperintendent former superintendent of\nthe Year Chris Irwin Rick Rick Jaspers\nand now Matt dubnick who chairs the\neducation Appropriations what all of us\nhave seen is you know time has evolve\nand\neducation doesn't have to always look\nexactly the same but I'll tell you\nwhat's consistent on the education\ncommittee 95 98 of the time all we\nreally work on is what you think of as\nmore traditional Public Schools or\nCharter Schools so again it's not either\nor and Georgia and our nation if you\nthink about it has a long and strong\nrecord of using tax dollars for public\npurposes or goals\nutilizing private or non-profit\ninstitutions to provide needed services\nto individuals it's not a rejection of\nsay someone who works for the government\nit just means that sometimes it takes an\narray of methods to fulfill State goals\nin this case education\nPell Grants go to public and private\ncolleges well they go to the student for\npublic at public or private colleges the\nGI Bill public or private colleges Head\nStart private day cares\nuh food stamps people use them at public\ngrocery or private grocery stores WIC\nMedicare Section 8 vouchers we found\ngive folks a public voucher instead of\nalways having public housing give them a\nvoucher and let them decide where it's\nbest to go what best serves their needs\nMedicaid we don't hire all the doctors\nand PAs and nurse practitioners to\nprovide services we give people\nessentially a voucher through Medicaid\nand let them find the private provider\nthat can best provide their needs if you\nlook through the budget Community\nAffairs and Community Health you'll find\nit full of private for-profit and\nnon-profit providers that provide\nservices that government alone never\ncould provide all\nand it does it's not a rejection it's\nnot a you know it's not to say that\nhaving government employees providing\nthese Services is any less\nmy children went to public school they\ndidn't want to go to a charter school\nthey wouldn't have wanted to go to a\nprivate school but most of us know\na few kids where maybe it just wasn't\nthe best fit for them and so I will say\nthat uh well additionally I'll say I\ndon't say Pre-K students out of 84\n000 students in Georgia four years old\nreceiving a Pre-K voucher half of them\ntake that voucher to a private Pre-K\nprovider generally a daycare center and\nthe other half go to a public school\nI've never heard a single one of my\ncolleagues on the floor or a constituent\ncomplained to me because they weren't\nall at the public school and by the way\nthe private Pre-K providers don't offer\na door-to-door bus service just as as\nthe public do it's just a different\noption that works for some people well\napparently it works for half the Pre-K\nparents\nour general budget funds 24\n367 Georgia college students for nine\nhundred dollars yearly teg grants\ntuition Equalization grants to take to a\nprivate college\nthat's out of the general budget just as\nthis would be and by the way there's no\nfiscal note on that because it's\nappropriated\na fiscal note just sort of a little\nLearning lesson here a fiscal note is\nrequired for a tax bill because a tax\nbill is an appropriation in law it\nrecurs until you change the law you know\nwe fight over those just about every\nyear a little bit on the floor an\nappropriation I I look at the difference\nan appropriation is an addition or\nsubtraction\nWays and Means uh is is multiplication\nand division it multiplies every year\nevery year you pay it if it's a tax bill\nif it's tax law in appropriation it goes\ndown it goes up there's no fiscal note\nhere because it's zero until the\nAppropriations Committee in the house\nthe Appropriations Committee in the\nSenate and the governor signs the bill\nfor some amount maybe they decide it's\ngoing to be 50 Children maybe it's going\nto be a hundred of these\nwe don't know that would go through an\nAppropriations process\nGeorgia's budget funds between forty six\nhundred and six thousand dollars a year\nfor Hope private and hope Zell private\nyearly\num scholarships to students that attend\nour 30 private colleges\num if you don't like using public\ndollars and those are public dollars\nthat are\nappropriate well they're appropriated\nthen\num Matt Hatchett is over there waiting\nyou know we're going to have the\nconference committee let us know if you\nwant to cut that money out because that\nis a voucher going to our 30 private\nschools and I'll just remind you there\nare constituents too that's why I don't\nregret using teg or private hope because\nwho am I to tell someone that they\nshouldn't go to you know Young Harris or\nMercer or these other colleges that also\nby the way hire our constituents to\nprovide these services to our\nconstituents and I value them I'm a\nproduct of public colleges in Georgia my\nchildren are products of public colleges\nin Georgia but they have friends and I\nhave constituents and so do you that\nhave utilized these services\num one one of the members mentioned the\nspecial needs scholarship for those with\ndisabilities in the SSO both of which\nuse public dollars I will mention that\nneither of those programs has the\naccountability\ntransparency and testing Provisions that\nSenate Bill 233 possesses I would ask\nanyone to demonstrate or to show another\nvoucher\nplan in any state that is as well\ncrafted narrowly crafted and with as\nmuch transparency and accountability as\nthis bill and I do thank those on the\neducation committee that work so hard as\nwell as the Senate who initiated it and\nall of these examples that I'm sharing\nwith you and I I will close\nthey they don't necessarily it's not\nthat they don't support public education\npublic colleges or public health or all\nthe other vouchers that we have in our\nbudget what they do is they expand and\nthey enhance the reach of state\ngovernment to cover the needs and the\naspirations of all Georgians and I would\nask for you to consider voting for\nSenate Bill 233 and with that Mr Speaker\nI will yield the well\nthe lady has yielded well\nto have him\nremainder at a time\nis yielded to\na Governor's floor leader\nrepresentative will Wade\nhey guys good evening\nso first a lot of y'all were in the\nAnnie room and y'all were talking and I\nthink y'all need to hear something\nreally important today is my 20th\nwedding anniversary\npeople so thank you\nlove you Jennifer thank you for all you\ndo and I know you're taking care of our\nour beautiful children\nso I want to address a couple things\nbecause you've heard some of you have\nheard some information that I I'm not\ngoing to speak negatively of one of our\npeers but I'm not sure that they were\nmade aware of some of the actual things\nthat we've done\nin this house through our education\ncommittee with folks that have deep\nbackground in education from a\nsuperintendent from a former cat\ndirector former teachers\nEtc\nwe have put in this in section\n20-2b-4 A few items\nthis is not going to go into effect\nagain until\nnot this next school year but the\nfollowing there's going to be a year of\nplanning to ensure that these things are\nmet\nbut we are going to require things like\naggregate data of student attendance and\ncourse completion rates of the eligible\ncourse core courses and the CTA courses\nthat these students will be receiving in\nthis school this is an accountability\nand transparency piece that I've heard\neducational advocates\nfor over a decades asking for\nwe'll also continue to ensure\nthat they will attend a school a public\nschool first this is not going to allow\nsomebody that's currently in private\nschool an opportunity\nto come back and circumvent the system\nthis is to ensure that kids that are in\nthis city these schools are in the\nbottom quartile of performance will have\nthis option\nin lines 162 we're going to comply with\nanti-discrimination Provisions they're\ngoing to comply with all health and\nsafety laws and codes that apply to\nprivate schools\nthey have to be located in Georgia\nfolks somebody got up here and told you\na few things that weren't true\nI just want it to be factual\nI know this body respects facts I'm a\nBeliever in facts\nI also want you to think about this\nthey are going to ensure\nevery single year that the funds that\nare utilized there's going to be a\nreport that's going to be given and\nsubmitted to this body\nwe're going to talk about Effectiveness\nand comparisons for for outcomes\nwe're not going to do this without\nconsidering that this is an actual\nbetter option for students\nwe're going to have tests I think you\nsome of you weren't in the room so I\nwant you to hear this\nchairman Jones indicated to you\nthat there's going to be a norm\nreference test every single year we do\nnot currently require that of our Public\nSchools if a student receives this they\nwill be required to do so and then the\nthird grade in the eighth grade they\nwill be taking\nthe same test that Public School third\ngraders and 8th graders take so that we\ncan compare that data\nI've heard advocates for years ask us to\ndo that\nwe are doing that in this legislation\nso I just wanted you to be aware that\nthat is extremely important to this\nhouse it was extremely important to the\neducation committee because we believe\nthat is a proper way to address those\ncomparative concerns\nI understand that there are folks that\nare receiving a few messages\nand I get it there's a lot of folks that\ndon't know exactly what's in this bill\nbut we all have a responsibility to be a\npart of analyzing what this is going to\ndo for constituents and again I just\nwant to remind you\nchildren should be the center of our\nFocus\nnot adults\nI love our teachers\ny'all they have been through some of the\ntoughest times over the last couple of\nyears\nand this state has supported them with\nour pay raises\nfully funding education now if we want\nto have a conversation about updating\nQBE I'm there I'm ready\nI'm very willing to address that this is\nnot the time\nwe're in a period of time which we have\nfully funded it and let's continue that\nconversation let's gather more\ninformation based on student outcomes\nacross this state\nbut I ask you this\nif you're a person that still hasn't\ndecided\nthink about this\nto me this is going to be the most\nimportant point so I hope you will\nlisten\nthere are school systems and communities\nthat are doing a lot\nfor kids\nthey get up every day and they try\nthe teachers try\nthe families try\nthe community tries\nand they succeed\nbut they're also parts of this state\nthat have had struggles\nI came from a community that had those\nstruggles as a kid half my freshman\nclass\nit was a classic\n202 of us in 1993.\nI graduated with 96 and 96.\nthat wasn't acceptable\nfolks there are too many communities\nthat we have kids that are\nyes they're at 100 poverty rate\nbut they're also at 100 percent not\nreading at grade level in third grade\nthey're 100 not radiant grade level in\neighth grade\nthose parents are looking for an option\nno one is going to require them to take\nthis if they are completely satisfied\nwith the school that they are in\nand they want to continue to hope that\nthings are going to get better and that\nnext teacher the next year is going to\nwork out or if they repeat repeat first\ngrade that it's going to get better the\nnext time\nI respect that that those families have\nthat choice\nbut if you're that parent that has been\nin that classroom\nand seen the situation not get any\nbetter\nwe had a testimony from one of the\ncolleagues in the Democratic Party come\nand talk to us about kids on buses\nfighting in schools because the school\nbuses were overcrowded we we looked at\nthe school system's data\nthe school system had\nover a hundred million dollars in their\nending fund balance and they can't as\nadults figure out how to make the\ndecisions to ensure that those buses\nare not\nadequately running so that the kids can\nnot have to sit in each other's laps\nlook these are adult issues and we need\nto address it but kids\nneed us to make this an option again I I\nbelieve every every person in here needs\nto know that\nGovernor Kemp appreciates the effort of\nboth the Senate and in this house\nbut he really appreciates and he\nsupports this legislation\nbecause this strikes the balance that\nthis discussion needs it gives parents\nchoices\nand I hope that you will consider\nsupporting this edu this I believe\nmeaningful option that is not going to\ndecimate public education\nit's going to give choice to those that\nhave been asking for it and I hope that\nyou will give your vote with that\nyield the well thank you\ngood timing because your time had\nexpired\nfor what purpose of speaker Pro Tim\nJones rise make a motion\nState your motion I move that this house\ntable Senate Bill 233\nclerk will read the caption\nSenate Bill 233 by Senator

the\nofficial go to George annotated relaying\nthe special license plates promoting or\nsupporting certain worthy agency's funds\nor non-profit corporations this bill I\nhaven't referred to the committee on\nmotor vehicles that committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass\nby rules committee substitute\nthe gentleman from the 121st chairman\nwiedauer\nokay\nI like that better anyway\nyou would do a much better job than he\nwould have there representative Holcomb\nrepresentative Holcomb is recognized to\npresent the bill I think he's had\nsomething to do with this before thank\nyou referee Holcomb yes\nthank you Mr Speaker\num uh I have been in this situation\nbefore I think it was around seven years\nago when the house was trying to advance\nlegislation to\num end the backlog of untested sexual\nassault kits\num\nfor whatever reason we had a bottleneck\nacross the way in the Senate but the\nhouse worked really hard and passed a\nbill that made a real difference in the\nlives of many Georgians and today I\npresent to you Senate Bill 35 you may\nrecognize it this was formerly house\nbill 364.\num House Bill 364 is to reform the way\nthat the state compensates the\nwrongfully convicted\nthis measure gained even greater\nimportance after yesterday because\nthe house bill 364 as well as the\nindividual resolutions all of which\npassed in this chamber\num\nthe Senate Advanced House Bill 364 but\nout of subcommittee but did not move it\nto full committee which effectively\nmeant that it was dead and then they\ntabled all of the individual resolutions\nby tabling all the individual individual\nresolutions unless Vehicles can be found\nfor those\nthose individuals that spent years and\nyears and years of their lives will not\nget relief\neven though we have the money in the\nbudget and we passed resolutions for\nthem so what we're trying to do with\nthis with Senate Bill 35 is to set up\nthe commission so that way if this is\nadopted\nby the senate or approved by the Senate\nand then signed by the governor the\nclaimants with the resolutions that are\npending could file under this system\nthe Senate did make a couple of\nsuggestions and so in the interest of\nnot wanting the bill to come back to us\nwe incorporated those into the measure\nand one of them was which I agreed with\nwas to change the dollar figures the\nbase was 50 000 they recommended raising\nit to 60 000 the national average is\naround 75 000 and then to change the top\nend from 100 to 120 that will all be at\nthe discretion of the board so there\nwill be oversight but that's the major\nchange that I wanted to highlight to you\nso I'd be happy to answer any questions\nbut certainly would appreciate your\nfavorable consideration and if it passes\ntoday that would be the third time\nthat this measure passes which\ninterestingly to start where I finished\nit took three times for the house to\npass the rape kit bill before we got it\nthrough\nthird time's a charm we hope let's see\nwould you take a question yes Mr Speaker\nrepresentative Paris has a question\nwhere is she representative Parish you\nhave a question your lights on\nshe waits you have no questions all\nright thank you Mr Speaker\nthe gentleman has yielded the well we\nappreciate your work on this important\nbill\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair

adopting you\nsubstitute offered by the committee on\nrules\nchair here's none the rules committee\nsubstitute is adopted is there any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill the chair heals none\nreport the committee is agreed to shall\nthis bill now pass all in favor of the\npassage of the bill we will vote Yes all\nthose opposed will vote no and the clerk\nwill unlock the machine\nthank you\nhave all members voted\nall members voted if so the clerk will\nlock the machine\non the passage of the bill the yeased\nare\n137 the Nays 14. the bill hadn't\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed\ngo get them big boy\nclerk will read the captions of SB 103\n103.\nset up a 103 by Senator Goodman of the\neighth and others to be entitled knocked\nto a man Article 5 of chapter 12 of\ntitle 44 the official go to Georgia\nannotated relating the disposition of\nunclaimed property so as to provide for\nthe handling of certain Wills this bill\nhaving for the committee on Judiciary\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass by committee substitute\nrepresentative Vance Smith is recognized\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen we we passed this bill last\nyear it deals with dor and unclaimed\nproperties we have taxpayers citizens\nthat have probably had family that\npassed away and they've had property\nthere it may be stocks or whatever it is\nwe're trying to help those people recoup\nthis unclaimed property and y'all were\nnice enough last year to pass it out and\nwent to the Senate got on their calendar\nand they never got to it at the end of\nthe year so we coming back this year SB\n103 uh just to give you a couple of\nnumbers I average rate of return in\nGeorgia's 9 percent\nthe national average is 38 percent\nFlorida's average is 59 percent so we're\ntrying to raise that average and the way\nwe're going to try to do that we're\ngoing to offer the individuals in our\nstate another option they can go through\nthe whole process themselves which is a\npretty interesting process or they can\ngo to a third party and they can\nnegotiate with those third-party people\na cost that cost is capped at 30 percent\nso they can negotiate but they they can\nhelp them\nrecoup this unclaimed property and\nthat's what's going on in the State of\nFlorida with that 59 percent so I'd\nreally ask for your favorable\nconsideration uh and let's get this\nproperty back to the citizens if I'll\nyou if any questions Mr Speaker you have\na question all right representative\nWilkerson in to your left in the back\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield yes sir I guess I still have the\nsame concerns I had last year uh\ncurrently\nI cannot check for my spouse nor my kids\nunder Georgia law to see if there's any\nunclaimed property has that been\naddressed so I can go into search myself\nbut unless you have an interest in that\nproperty you cannot check\nhave we addressed that you're going to\nexplain your question a little bit more\nso under current law in Georgia we can\ngo to the website and pull up our name\non that website you type in your name\nand see if you had any unclaimed\nproperty I can do that for myself\nhowever if I wanted to check my family\nmy my son my daughter my wife my brother\nthat is illegal under Georgia law so in\norder to increase the ability to return\nfunds should we not\nallow us to at least check for family\nmembers\nwell that's a good point I I can't\naddress your answer I'm sorry I can't\ngive you an answer to that right there\nbut okay um but other than that I think\nthis will be a big benefit do you heal\nfor one more question yes sir\num under current law the fees I believe\non line 338 to 342 we kept it at 10 is\nthere a reason why on 380 to 384 we're\nmaking it 30 that seems like a pretty\nbig jump from 10 to 30 percent as far as\nthe maximum amount of fees that can be\ncharged to return someone's legally\nowned property well it's negotiable and\nyou don't you don't have to pay that fee\nif you don't even have to use a third\nparty so that's that's strictly\nnegotiable by the individual and it was\nin that it was the same amount as in the\nbill last year that were passed\nthank you Mr Speaker I appreciate your\nfavorable consideration and I'll yield\nthe will\nthe gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere an objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair hears\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection
