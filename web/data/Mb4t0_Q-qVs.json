  "transcript": "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Well since this is the 33rd day, we thought we'd be on a speaker's time. Most of you know what I mean. The hour for meeting having arrived, all members will please take their seats. Mr. Clerk will you please ring the bell. We're going to have the morning row call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. Have all members now voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning needs no introduction. He's the gentleman, pastor from the 128 House District down in Tenel, Georgia. We're representing Mac Jackson, a dear friend to all in this body, but a special friend, speaker David Rolston. So much so the speaker he'll tell the story but I won't tell it again first in this introduction. It unbeknownst to Reverend Jackson on that day, there were several state patrol vehicles out in front of his church. He said, what's going on? And who do you think there was there to attend services that day? Let's speak our David Rolston. That just built on the relationship that represented Jackson and the representative speaker Rolston built with one another. Two special men that represented the very best in what our state is about and what our people about. I want to ask Representative Mac Jackson to come bring our devotion for the day. Reverend James Jackson. Thank you, the speaker. Good morning to everyone. You know, when I think about that day when speaker Rolston surprised me, nobody told me that he was coming and all of a sudden there he was on a Sunday morning. He cared enough to come down to Washington County to see me. And when I asked him why, he said, because you are my friend, speaker Rolston had a way of letting you know that he cared about you. And today as we honor him, I counted an honor and a privilege to be able to speak on behalf of a man who loved the state of Georgia. As I was searching the scripture on last night, I saw in the book of Luke in Luke chapter 10 in verse 25, and it said that a lawyer stood up and he asked Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus asked some of the question. He said, what is written? And he said, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself. And Jesus said to him, you have answered right, do this and you shall live. But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor? And Jesus answered and said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothing and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead. And by chance that came down a certain priest that way. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.\n\nAnd likewise, a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he during it came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. And went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an end and took care of him. And the next day when he departed, he took out two pints and gave them to the host and said to him, and whatsoever you spend more, when I come again, I will repay you. Which now of these three do you think was a neighbor to him that fell among the thieves? And he said he that showed mercy on him, then Jesus said to him, go and do likewise. And I believe that Speaker Rauston had read Luke chapter 10, because he was a neighbor to so many Georgians, his life parallel, the good Samaritan that Jesus talked about in this passage. In 2020, he led the fight to pass House Bill 426, the hate bill crime, the hate crime bill. But he saw a young man who was killed while jogging, and he considered him as his neighbor. In 2021, he led the fight on HB 479 to repeal the citizens of rest law, because a mob Aubrey's family was his neighbor. In 2022, Speaker David Rauston backed House Bill 1013 to expand access to affordable mental health treatment and behavior health services across the state of Georgia. Again, he saw all Georgians as his neighbor. In 2017, Speaker Rauston formed the Rule Development Council. And when we draw up the LJ for our first meeting, and he charged us as a committee to look for ways to bring academic development to our rural communities too. Ladies and gentlemen, this good man cared about Georgians. He cared about Georgians in Blue Ridge. He cared about Georgians down on the coast. He cared about Georgians in Albany. He cared about Georgians in Millageville. He cared about Georgians in Atlanta in Thomasville in Tipton. We traveled all over the state and listened to what citizens needs were because he saw every Georgian as his neighbor. When I was in grade school, we learned a poem by Henry W. Longfellow. And the poem was titled A Song of Life. And in verse 1 it says, Tell me not in mournful numbers. Life is but an empty dream. For the soul is dead as slumbers and things are not what they seem. But I think verse 7 speaks of Speak of David Rostin. And verse 7 says, Lives of great men all remind us. We can make our lives sublime and departing, Leave behind us, footprints on the sands of time. Ladies and gentlemen, Speak of Rostin left footprints on the sands of time. Let us pray. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears. It was you who brought us safe this for. And as we remember this great man, who you allowed us to know for just a short time, teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. Holy Spirit, teach us to love one another as Christ loves the church. Teach us to use our words and our actions to bring glory to you and your kingdom. Heavenly Father, not just empty words, but a sincere desire to honor you. Change our hearts and help us to be more like you. And as we honor this great man today, let us understand and let us remember that our lives speak for themselves. This we pray in Jesus' name, Amen. Join me as we pledge allegiance to the flag. A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands. One nation under our indivisible liberty and justice for all. The Colleagues, friends, today we will honor and celebrate the awesome legacy for our dear departed colleague, friend and brother, our 73rd speaker of the house, David Rolston. A proud son of North Georgia, the great mountains of North Georgia might be very specific, a breed attorney, an altruistic, dedicated public servant, today would have been his 69th birthday. There's no doubt he loved this state. He loved this house and he loved every member who served in this body. He lived by the biblical lesson. Come now and let us reason together. You can look back over the years his tenure in this house and you see monumental achievements. But you'll also see the mark of a man who cared deeply for those whom he served. Whether it was adoption reform, paid parental leave, hate crimes or mental health, he worked every day as our speaker to see the state's future become writer for all Georgians. It is fitting that we pause for a few moments, daughter of his life, his legacy and the incredible impact he had on our state. We want to share a video with you this time. So if you view the screens. President Rolston, you have received the majority of the votes cast. It's here by the Claire and elected speaker of the Georgia House representatives for the ensuing term. You have honored me beyond measure by entrusting to me this position. And I will never forget that. I am here today to do what I can for you and for this state that we all love. One of my favorite times in the mountains where we live is in the early morning after a stormy night. You know a night that's, you've had rain, and it claps of thunder, flashes of lightning, maybe wind, storms all night. Then it gets quiet before dawn. And then when the day begins to break, I enjoy looking to the east over the mountains in that direction to watch the sun come. And I like to enjoy watching it because often it burns through the fog, broughtening up the day with the promise and hope of a new day. And as we are here today, I see that sun rising over this house and burning through the fog and lifting this house of representatives up. And I see it rising over the entire state of Georgia. And that's my vision. And it may I close by saying, thank you once again. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. May God bless each one of you, your family, and may God continue to richly bless the great state of Georgia. Thank you very much. Mr. Clark Ring the Bell. We always knew that dad enjoyed public service. Public service was a passion and a calling for him. Knowing that that was his love, his passion, made it a whole lot easier to share him with everybody in the state. He was larger than life, many ways. But his service to our state and the impact he made on the policies that impact the people's everyday lives in the state, for me, is what him bodies, what David Roxton was about. I speak Roxton was a heavy lifter and he liked to take home things that were transformational. How this is of that nature, you must form coalitions and you must coalesce. And that's one of the arts of negotiating that he had, that he was willing to do that. Today it was you who gave hope to many, many George's. God bless you. He was the solid force, level headed, the run up in the room at times. I think solid is a good word for him. I just thought so highly of him. He could say more than five minutes than any other person I've ever seen in politics. He was a big man with a big strong voice and he could swing that gavel and demand attention. And he could lead that chamber and run that chamber. The house of representatives with iron fists. But he also could do it with a big old soft heart. My sister and I joked as we were growing up that this is the same man who would bring them around straight dogs that he would find on the side of the road because he noticed a straight dog on the side of the road. The man that I grew up with for 33 years was just one of the nicest and warm hardest people that I've ever met. I knew him as a person who deeply loved his family. He always remembered where he came from and but he also realized that people were counting on him and us all over Georgia to make it better. Today, home to one. Oh, he loved Georgia. He loved the state. He loved everything about Georgia. There wasn't much about this state that he didn't find just amazing. I think he would want to be remembered and I think he was the average person. He came up from humble beginnings and I think that that's what drove his thought process. You know, when he made decisions or when he ran the houses that he always tried to look at things from the average person's perspective. He was a big thinker. He was a person that always was willing to listen and to share his ideas and to accept other's ideas. The thing I admired the most about him is he would not jump to conclusions. He would not rush to judgment to make a quick decision. He wanted to hear all sides of an argument. He wanted to hear from people for a situation or against an issue. He wanted to hear from Democrats Republicans. He wanted to hear from the business community. The speaker was available. He always had time for me and he had time for others. But more importantly, he enjoyed the engagement that he had. David Dawson was passionate about our state's economy and about giving all people economic opportunity. He was very proud of the fact that we're the number one state in the country for business. And he was very passionate about making sure that we had a good business environment in this state. And he would work in a bipartisan way to make sure that that happens. And I think that'll certainly be one of his legacies. So in R and the D disappear. And the Georgia take its place. We are in a period of complexity. And we have to push hard, work hard, put in the hard work, find ways to do things together collectively. He was unequivocal about that. I think by doing that, by finding common ground, by finding solutions is a tremendous, tremendous way to honor the service and the life of Speaker Ralston. I enjoyed being in the trenches with him. He strove with his leadership to bring a level of civility and inclusiveness in the chamber. Because David Ralston realized that we are all elected geographically from different areas of the state and that every area matters. I think people are going to look back at the time that David Ralston was here. Now that we've seen some of the things that have been put into motion because of his leadership, we know now that he made the right decisions, whether it be broadband or rural development, health care, mental health, transportation. But we had hate crime. He stepped to the plate and helped get that through the finish line. And when you start talking about the things of that nature, which are transformational, which are qualitative life issue, I think it paints a pretty good picture of who David Ralston was. We are a better state because of the work that we all did together and I accept all of us to really take the things that he did, the lessons that he taught us and the legacy that he has left and built on that. He would let you know that he did the best job he could and he left the house and the state in good hands, and that he believes in the leaders that are currently in place and that he would want them to carry on and keep doing the state's business. One of the things that I think he'd be proud of that we will continue, that we will make sure that all the views in this house are honored and they're considered as we move forward with policy. You know, I miss him but I still feel like he's here, things that we made better for George, who will live on because he was about public service, not politics. I just care about his neighbor, care about my neighbor. I'm very proud to have served with him and for him to have been my friend. We're as cannot express my friendship or relationship with David Ralston and I was truly truly missed him. As I said, when you passed a giant pine tree has fallen in the state of George. And the chair hereby declares the 20-22 session of the Georgia House of GERND, SIDEDA! The President of Ralston has received the majority of the votes cast is hereby declare an elected speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives for the insur- What a great tribute. Thank you Betsy, to your new routine. I would now ask Mr. Clerk if you would read a resolution. House Resolution 7 by Representative Burns, the 159th challenge with the 47th hatchet of the 155th, the 134th and the 143rd. A resolution honoring and remembering the life of the honorable David Ralston, 73rd speaker of the House of Representatives of this great state and for other purposes. Whereas the honorable David Ralston was born March 14, 1954 in L.J. Georgia, a distinguished native son of North Georgia. And whereas he attended Young Harris College and later earned a bachelor's degree from North Georgia College and State University and earned his law degree from the University of Georgia School of Law. And whereas he ran a successful law practice providing sound legal advice and counsel and Blue Ridge, Fannie County, Georgia for over four decades. And whereas he began a long distinguished career in public service in 1992 upon being elected to the Georgia Senate, where he served three consecutive terms. And whereas in 2002 he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, where was the elected speaker in 2010, which positioned he held until his untimely death. Whereas as speaker he shepherded many pieces of legislation beneficial to the citizens of the great state of Georgia through the legislature, including tax relief, criminal justice reform, transportation, infrastructure, funding, modernization, and adoption reform. And whereas he had a particular passion for improving the healthcare provided to Georgia citizens struggling with mental health issues. And whereas on November 16, 2022 he died peacefully at Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, surrounded by his beloved wife Sheree, his children Matt and Elizabeth, and his family. And whereas the State of Georgia mourns the loss of this monumental statesman, distinguished Georgia, a native son of Gilmer County. Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives that the members of this body joined together to express their deepest regret at the passing of the 73rd speaker of the House of Representatives, the honorable David Ralston, and extend their most sincere condolences to his family. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. You remain standing just for a minute. I know that I'm very honored and privileged to stand here on this roster. I know that any of you, that are members here, when I look around this room, former members, former colleagues, staff members who work so closely, speaker David Ralston, could be honored to come here just as I am and stand here on this day. It is a special day for this House. The man who left his imprint on this House. We will never forget him. You may be seated.

Sheree, Matt, John, Family, Sarah, they all come up. What an honor and a privilege to be with all of you today and to be in this room that my husband loves so very much. I'd like to start out by saying that our family, thanks you for this honor. My husband loved this state and he wanted to leave it a better place. He loved our community and he worked tirelessly to leave it a better place. If you are a staff member of David Ralston, he loved you and wanted you to be better and he always tried to facilitate that. We thank you. We love you, David Ralston loved you. He considered you family. Thank you for having us here today. Thank you Sheree. I'll be seated. John Ralston, I know what it is to lose a brother. It's a hard one. Matt, much stay with me.

Family is everything in life. From his immediate family to this House family. He loved and cared for us all collectively and individually in a very special way. I want to remind y'all of something to everyone who can hear my voice today. A story seldom told is soon forgotten. Let's tell this story. Let's continue to honor our friend by telling the story. What he did for all Georgians, what he will do for Georgians, for generations to come by the policies he implemented. He worked so diligently for with us here in this House. So let's continue to honor him. Speaker David Ralston, my remembering and carrying on his good work. We must never, ever forget a true champion for the people of Georgia. Speaker David Ralston, thank y'all. Now as Speaker Ralston would have asked us to do, carry on with the goodness of this day. Doorkeepers, will you unlock the doors? Now we love our chaplain. You can have a photo with him anytime. So if you're as I one now, you can go in that South Anya room and get one. But we have family and former members here.

Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the Augusta Richmond County Consolidated Government is a comprised of eight districts and two super districts voting commission and that this legislation was prepared by the mayor of the city of Augusta on his letter here in sit without the full body voting on this legislation. I'm sure the lady who lives in that area of this state knows of what she speaks. Father inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry? Is this not true also that we are in violation of House Rule 8.1 here in this chamber that we adopted at the beginning of session because there are required signatures are not on the legislation from the local delegation. I'm sure the lady believes that it passed out of committee so I trust our process that they looked at the rule and assured us that it is in the proposition. Yes, inquiring, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry? Is it true? Is it not true that I will not be supporting this legislation because one half of the Richmond County commissioners had no idea that this resolution was even being sent up here to the legislative council to be determined by one senator and one representative from Augusta Richmond County. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For what purpose does the representative Gladney rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is Speaker Yiel, sir. Paul Serian Quarry. State you inquiry? Sir, is it not true that according to the delegation rules it requires the legislative request from Augusta Richmond County be presented to the delegation and they were not and I will not be supporting this legislation. I will be voting no on HB 231, sir. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks and she has that right. Thank you, sir. For what purpose is representative Howard rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Isn't it true that I have gotten calls from some of the five commissioners and constituents who were not asked to sign the resolution that initiated SB 231? I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Further inquiry. State you inquiry? Isn't it true that the majority of the members of the local delegation opposes this bill on procedural grounds? If the gentleman says states we're going to find that out in just a minute. Finally, one more. State you inquiry? Isn't it true that I heard yesterday that it is a time on a tradition to respect the wheel of the local delegation when it comes to local legislation? I'm sure the gentleman understands what he speaks of and believes in what he speaks. For what purpose does chairman Newton rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that of the 11 members of our local community leadership, the mayor and 10 commissioners that Senator Burns and I received a request from six of those 11 to put forward this movement? I'm sure the gentleman lives in that part of the Georgia and he understands. So I respect what the gentleman says. For what purpose does the bill rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that I also heard yesterday that we would give the same difference that we were given yesterday by the opposing party? Well, I don't know what all of y'all heard yesterday, but I'm sure the gentleman is conferred exactly what he thought he heard yesterday. We have one last inquiry as representing Thomas from the 21st. For what purpose does representing Thomas rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry. Is it not true that yesterday the people that are complaining about voting on local bills voted against my local bill yesterday? And I'm not a big fan of hypocrisy. Is that not true? Well, I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I'm sure that the gentleman knows what he speaks on the vote count from yesterday. I'm going to take one more and that's from, for what purpose does representing Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. It would be helpful. Is it not true that it would be helpful if someone could explain to me that if a local delegation has rules under rule 18, that therefore those rules should be followed, and the only time you would go to the end of the government coordination under my understanding is if they do not have rules. And in this case, my understanding is the government has rules. Therefore, they should have followed the normal process, and I would be very appreciative if someone could explain that to me at some point later. Well, I like you inquiry because you can explain to you later. And you can, when you get to answer, I hope you'll share that with me as well. So I'm sure the gentleman understands what he said and believes that. Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machines on the passage of the bill on the local calendar of the eyes or 99, the NACE 70, this bill haven't received it requisite. Costitutional majority is therefore passed. We're going to recognize our doctor of the day today, representing Doug Stoner. Representative Stoner will introduce our doctor of the day. Hello. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm very enthusiastic to introduce the doctor of the day today because he's actually my doctor. My actual endo, actually, my wife too, who's here with me, he's our endo, is I mentioned both my wife and I, my wife's type one and I'm type two. And so we're happy to have him here, and particularly because today is type one diabetes awareness day here, both in the house and senate. So we're definitely happy to have him here on that issue too. So just real quickly, Dr. Jonathan O.B. is a Tennessee native and graduated from Magna Camlata from Lee University. He graduated medical school from the University of Tennessee and completed his internal medicine residency at the University of Alabama Birmingham. And he moved to Atlanta and completed his inter-crenonology fellowship at Inri University. And he practices general inter-crenonology and focuses on insulin pump management for patients with type one diabetes, pituitary tumors, thyroid diseases, and a general diseases. He also performs ultrasound, guided thyroid biopsies in the office. So he's also doing research. His research findings have been published in well-known medical journals and works as an investigator and a sub-investigator and multiple clinical trials currently active within the practice. He has presented before annual meetings with the American Association of Clinical and Endocrinologist, and travels to educate other doctors regarding new and emerging endocrin- nod. I'm having fun with this one today. Endocrinotherapies. And in 2014, he was honored by the juvenile diabetes research foundation. One group initiative and recognition of his confidence in community educational and networking activities. And Distinctswin also recognizes efforts in creating awareness of cutting-edge research supported by JDRF and hopes to find a cure for type one diabetes. One of the quick things for the doctor, say a few comments. On your desk today, there's an example, a visual example for you to look at about managing diabetes and how that works. And this is something I think, because the leading cause of blindness in the United States is diabetes and everything. To this time, Dr. As an endocrinologist and a diabetes specialist, it's an honor to serve as Dr. The Day for you today, especially today since today's type one diabetes day here at the Capitol. Please be sure to read all the information that we've provided to you at your desk. And if you run into any of the pages since they are children, be sure to ask them. They'll be more than happy to show you their insulin pump and their monitor if they're wearing it. Just show you how it is to live with a chronic disease, especially as a kid. If you have any questions with the handouts that you have at your desk, feel free to come see me at clinic. Thank you. We're especially proud to have you with us on this day. And thanks for those explanations. We appreciate whether our medical staff that comes from all over this state comes in and provides for us. Thank you. Dr. We appreciate you being here. We'll move on to morning orders. Representative Wade is recognized for a morning order. Representative Will Wade. I want you to be on your own time limit this morning. We won't limit you too much, but don't abuse it. Representative Wade's recognized. Thank you very much, Speaker, and I do appreciate that. I will keep my comments short, but I want to honor two very important people and thank a friend that is here today. First I want to tell you that I put this book on your desks as a gift, because I want you to hear this as members of this house family. I love each of you. Each of you inspire someone each day. Many of you have taken a day out of your time and inspired me since being in this house. But this gift is to honor two very important men in my life. You see, two years ago today we had the going home party for my late father. He inspired me to serve. He was an example for my brother and myself and my community. His name was Charles Royl Wade III, born in Leslie, Georgia, Sumter County in 1947. He should have died at eight years old when he was run over by a car. But he didn't. He was inspired by a doctor to keep fighting. He grew up in one of the poorest parts of this state back in those days, and he was told he wouldn't ever accomplish anything. He had the equivalent of three masters degree, one in mathematics. So it was perfectly fitting that he would have passed on Pi Day and go on home. But to honor him, I wanted to give you this gift, but also for a person who was also important in my life. That is our former speaker, David Ralston. He was kind of the father of this house for a period of time. And he was an inspiration for many people as well, especially back in the mountains where I'm from. To honor both of those men, a friend of mine doesn't know that this book spoke to me immediately when I saw the title. But he's here today, Kevin Paul Scott, the author of this book. He's been a friend of mine and was with me when I found out my died was suffering from Alzheimer's and he's been a rock for me and my family. So this gift, I hope you will accept to honor both my father, Royl Wade, and also late speaker, David Ralston. And I hope that you will take time each day to be inspired and to be an inspiration. God bless you and thank you, speaker. Thank you, Representative. We appreciate that. Very meaningful. Representing Martinez is recognized for a more than order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today is, we got some beautiful women here from Loganville. The Loganville Women's Club is here representing our great city. Let me tell you something about these great women. This club was created in 1939. Their club motto is wisdom, justice, and moderation. They give so much to our community, including special Olympics, Loganville High School, and also the Girl Scouts. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to recognize them. Also I got a good friend, Mr. Doug Blemmons. His wife Samantha Doug Blemmons is a pillar in our community. He is a top producing insurance agent in Loganville. He's an achiever of the year. And he's also a former president of the Rotary Club. His agency gives so much to our community. And this past week he was recognized by being the best Walton insurance, the best insurance in Walton County. So Mr. Speaker and my fellow and my legislators, please let's recognize our great people from Loganville. Thank you. We're representing Mathis, recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the house. I'm here today on a good and happy note. We have the Blackly County High School Girls Cross Country team for winning the 180 Division 1, 2022 Cross Country State Champions. Like for you all to stand up today, we would especially want to recognize our coach, Shelly Cranford, our principal Brad Knox for Blackly County. If y'all stand up. So we have the individual State Champion in Cross Country Ella Gibbs here. And I want to throw a shout out for the individual boy State Champion from Blackly County Luke Churchill that was not able to be here with us with all these nice, pretty young ladies. So can I get members of the House to give them a big hand. Thank you very much. I'm going to be a little bit more patient. Representative Holland is recognized for a morning order and representing Becky Evans is up there with her too. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And any other Presbyterians in the House are welcome to come join us in the well. Colleagues, I am what's known as a cradle Presbyterian. I was born into the Presbyterian Church and I can do you one better. I was born to the associate pastor of Old First Presbyterian Church, which makes it my supreme honor to welcome Presbyterians for a better Georgia who are here with us today. This is a group that is called by their faith to share their thoughts on policy issues and the work that we're doing here as legislators based on their Christian beliefs. They are here today. Some of you may be being called to the ropes or visited in your offices. I would encourage you to meet with these fine folks who are here to speak with you, including the aforementioned associate, former associate pastor, my dad. If you get called by my dad to the ropes and you can't find the time to go say hello, you and I might need to have words later. Presbyterians, the old joke is that we are the lords frozen chosen, but I promise you the people here today have warm hearts and warm spirits. I'd like them to rise in the gallery so we can say hello. Thank you for being here. And thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Holland, and welcome to the People's House. Good to have you all. Representative Jason Ridley is recognized for a morning order. Mr. Speaker, thank you.

They're going to be able to build an all day today to four o'clock in room 201. As my buddy always says, it ain't cheap to look cool, but you can be cheaper today. Because I think a special price for all of us legislators are going to put the seal inside of the hat for you. So go over and make sure you go over and see him. Keith Mundy, the President of the American Hat Company, is also flew in, so he'll be over there measuring everybody. So if you want to look out at me, go get your hat. Thank you. Let's see now. We have a whole delegation warning to come up, Chair Lady Matthew Eck, Chairman Knight, and Representative Daniel. Y'all come on down. There comes Representative Daniel. Nice to have you. Nice to have you. And we're going to recognize this delegation for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we get to honor the Griffin High School Lady Bears. They recently won the 4A State Basketball Championship. If you'll please stand and honor their head coach Johnson, their assistant coach Puckett, and our Lady Bears from Griffin, Georgia. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. We are so proud of you ladies and thanks for coming today. Congratulations, a great achievement. Thanks for being here.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's India Day at the Capitol today and we were honored to have a great turnout earlier this morning with Dr. Swade Kulkarni, the council general for India here in Atlanta and about 100 great friends. We are so proud to have them at the Capitol today and we have presented this great resolution to recognize the great contributions that they have made to our wonderful state and to our community in North Atlanta. So we're just delighted that they're here. They're sadly they're gone already but anyway we'd like to stand up and recognize them for their great contributions to our state. I hope we got a picture of all you guys together. What do you mean it'll make cameras that big? We'll move on to the rules, calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to SB 3? SB 3 by Senator Albers of the 56 and others to be entitled to amend chapter 4 title 50 the fiscal day Georgia and tentative related to organization of executive branch generally so it's required state departments agencies, boards, bureaus, offices, commissions, public corporations and authorities to assess educational, experimental and training requirements for positions of employment. This bill I refer to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Thank you Mr. Clerk, Representative Scott Hilton has recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it's my honor to present to you Senate bill 3, the reducing barriers to state employment act of 2023. This is an effort to reduce the review of positions in state government to ensure that the education, skills and experience match up with a position we are currently hiring for. As you know both the private and public sector right now are in a war for talent and we don't want to place any artificial barriers in their way. As an employer we want to make sure that we are not requiring a four year degree, advanced degree or certification that does not apply to the job we are currently hiring for and lose out on the opportunity to have our best and brightest apply for that job. There are many technology jobs in our state that bill gates wouldn't even qualify for because he lacks a necessary college degree. We also have jobs that might require a five or ten years of experience in a technology or process that's only one or two years old. I want to give a special shout out to DOAS who will leave this effort and do a fantastic job of evaluating job descriptions and hiring needs in our state. Again we don't want to miss the opportunity to give people their chance to work for our state government and flourish in their career. This does not take away from the need for certain education and certifications at all. This is simply an opportunity for us to assess each one and make sure they accurately reflect the state's hiring needs. With that Mr. Speaker I will yield for questions. You have no questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker, are you the one? The gentleman is yielded well, we do have a speaker. Representative Jasmine Clark is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. Today I rise not to necessarily oppose this bill, but just to express some concerns I have about SB 3. I believe that the intentions of SB 3 are good. We have a work for shortage in our state agencies and we need a recruitment tool in our tool belt in order to fill those positions. Everything standards for those positions does have the effect of increasing the potential pool of candidates that are eligible for these jobs. From a logical standpoint this will then increase the number of eligible applicants. However I do think this bill ignores an important root cause of our work for shortage. While this is a great recruitment tool it is not going to help with retention. What good is it to people or to get people in the front door if they just walk right back out of the back door for a job with more competitive pay. People are trying to live their lives. They are trying to raise their family. They are trying to keep...\n\nroof over their head, they're trying to keep food on the table. In the state of Georgia, even if they get one of these state jobs that we might loosen the restrictions for, they still need that job to pay them enough money to survive. I've listened to enough appropriations presentations by different departments in our state to know that without actually paying more competitive wages, they can't keep people in these positions. Wages for state positions are just not competitive with private industry. And as private industry is actually doing the very thing that we are doing here today, and also re-evaluating educational requirements for certain positions, the net effect will ultimately be the same. They won't need the degree to get into private industry, and they can make sometimes double and triple what the state is willing to pay them to do these jobs. So as we vote today, let's ask ourselves what we really need in our state to address our work for shortage and to fill these empty positions right now that we want people in those positions. I think this is a step in a direction, but right now, I don't think it's necessarily the step in the right direction that we need to do to fill these positions. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose is represented Becky Evans-Rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry? Yes. Isn't it true that with the review of these state jobs that it could be some jobs don't require four-year degrees, and thus people may not encourage much debt, and thus we may be able to accept that the pay scale may be appropriate for these jobs if they just need a two-year degree. Get the lady so states? Yes, and isn't it also true that perhaps after this study we can look at the career fields and perhaps look at our hope grants, and maybe some additional areas might be worthy of the hope grant to your accreditation? The lady so states sounds like a little common sense to me. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 168, the nays 0. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 2727? Senate Bill 27, I Senator Brass, the 28th and others to be entitled to enact to amend Code Section 3364, the fiscal to Georgia annotated, relating the enumeration of unfair methods of competition and unfair to septivacs or practices in penalty. So it's a prohibitive health care insurer from requiring an ophthalmologist or optometrist to extend any discounts on services that are not covered. High care services, this bill I refer to the committee on insurance, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Matthew Gamble will present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to present to you Senate Bill 27. This legislation follows up on a bill that we passed two years ago in 2021, Senate Bill 43. The intent of that bill was to prohibit insurance companies from requiring optometrist or optometologists from being forced to provide discounts on non-covered services. An example of a non-covered service would be requiring a discount on a second pair of glasses that is not covered by insurance. We're pleased that most of the insurance companies have complied with this law. The optometrist and ophthalmologist both support this legislation. And what we're fixing in Senate Bill 27 that you have before you today is a loophole that we're seeking to further update the law to make it clear that requiring optometrists or optometologists to provide discounts on non-covered eye care services for increased rates, reimbursements, preferential treatment or any other benefit would be illegal. So with that, Mr. Speaker, that's what Senate Bill 27 does. I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you. Ask your favourable consideration of Senate Bill 27. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee which was favourable to the passage of the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose of the leader Beverly rise? The gentleman has that right and the gentleman will so reflect for what purpose is just Chairman Collins rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that anyone can see that this is a good bill? Well, I haven't locked the machine yet this till time. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the aides were 167, the nays 0. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is there for a pass. Now I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, it's a good bill. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to SB 116, 116? Senate Bill 116, by Senator Watson, the first and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 36376. The official code of Georgia and it's under relating to disposition of municipal property generally so it's revised provisions relating to the maximum term of certain leases or contracts for use operation or management of real or personal property. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, that committee recommends a disbuell due pass. The gentleman from down in Bell Dostoway, Chairman LeHood will present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. This bill, what it does, it lengthens the amount of time a municipality can lease a recreational facility from two five-year terms to 120-year term. And the reason this is necessary is because we have some tenants in these recreational facilities who want to engage in a significant cat-bex projects, you know, $10 million and more. And they just can't do that if they can't be insured of a longer lease. So that's what the bill does, Mr. Speaker. And if there's any questions, I'll yield for any. You have no questions. Very good. Ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the Report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will. Lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, all the yeas were 170, the nay zero. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We're ready to move on to afternoon orders. Representative Carter is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Doreen Carter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I go morning, thank you. I want you all to join me on this very special day. We celebrated our Speaker Rosson today as his birthday.

And we know that Speaker David Rolliston gave a lot to this General Assembly, to this state of Georgia, and to his beloved University of Georgia.

You know, as we go through the remainder of this day, committee meetings and tomorrow, the next couple of days, as we go through session and get in a very important fast-paced time for us, let's always be mindful of our own health and the health of other members. So today I want you to remember and say a prayer for the safe return and health return of representing Debbie Buckner. Representing Dar Shionkindrick. Representing Sheila Jones. And representing Pedro Marin. Nothing I'm giving you a law or a moan other than say, let's say a prayer, they return back to us and in the very near future, hopefully by tomorrow. And so members, you also will receive an email from leader Beverly and myself. If you do not, if you've not seen the services, then the schedule of services for representing the geese, we will send you those this afternoon so you can make appropriate plans with the family for her going home in the next few days.
