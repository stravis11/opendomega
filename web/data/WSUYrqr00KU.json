Would you join me in a word of prayer?\nO, mighty God, creator of heaven and earth, we praise you because you alone are worthy\nof our praise. Father's your word teaches us every good and perfect gift comes from you,\nand so we give thanks. And so, Father, I pray today that you would bless the men and women\nof this house, that you would bless the leadership, that you would give them wisdom beyond this\nworld, discernment beyond this age, knowledge that expands beyond our horizons and father\nmaturity as leaders, strengthen us, prepare us and help us always to remember that every\none of us is your child and your love covers us in Jesus' name. Amen. Would you join me in the pledge?\nOur pleasure, allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic\nfor which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nThank you so much, good to see you, good to see you.\nDoorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nYou\nThe Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and\nAudits.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker.\nYour Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative\nday and found it to be correct.\nFurthermore, Mr. Speaker, an Irish proverb for the clerk of this house, Bill Riley, who\nis a devoted Irishman.\nAnd this can't help come from the majority, if we have also, he had an hand in this.\nBut the saying is, do not resent growing old, many are denied the privilege.\nWell, it's good timing to recognize the clerk.\nI don't know how many of you know, but he turned over the odometer yesterday.\nI was commemorating your birthday yesterday, let's give him a hand.\nChairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the\njournal, the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.\nIs there any objection to the confirmation of the journal?\nThe chair here is done and the journal is confirmed.\nThe clerk will read the resolution, establishing the order of business for the day.\nMr. Burns, honor 59 of whose following be establishes the order of business during the\nfirst part of the period of unanimous consent, introduction of bills and resolutions, first\nreading and reference of House bills and resolutions, second reading of bills and resolutions, reports\nof standing committees, third reading and passage of uncontested local bills and resolutions,\nfirst reading and reference of Senate bills and resolutions, morning orders.\nIs there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business\nfor the day.
