days remaining in the legislative session, there is no better person to bring us some shalom than rabbi hershey minkowitz. i'll say he shared with me in his house they have 11 children. so i'm guessing he has very little shalom in his house, but he's going to bring some to this house today. in the summer of 1998, rabbi hershey minkowitz was sent to alfreda by the chabad movement. lady from the 51st, i'm getting a thumbs up. thank you. a subsection of the orthodox jews to establish a jewish worship and educational center for a growing jewish community in north fulton. rabbi hershey, as he's affectionately known, leads the chabad of north fulton until this day. their center has become a primary address where jews of all walks of life and religious backgrounds gather for jewish enrichment and inspiration. colleagues, please join me in welcoming rabbi hershey. thank you. good morning. a friend of mine rec"}, {"video_id": "x_vN8Y9K67g", "title": "Georgia House - Day 40

church, where the reverend paul tibido is the pastor. and i'm going to do sometimes we sit in the back and say whoever is up here is talking too much and then give the pastor enough time to talk, so i'm not going to be guilty of that. but i do want to say that the church is a sizable church, but it's not about the size of the church, it's about the things that they do. and during covid, the church provided food and provided vaccines, we did testing, we did everything to show that the church was about more than just conversation. it was about service. and with that, i'd like to ask you to

is a graduate of mercer university, southern baptist theological seminary, and received his doctorate from princeton theological seminary. he is the 33rd pastor in the history of first baptist church of columbus, a church that is as old as the city it serves. as a preacher's kid, one might observe that god had him in training all his life. as many of you experienced when you went to columbus recently, he is welcoming. he is great at caring for his flock. he is thoughtful in his sermons, messages, and conversations. he is nurturing and involved in preparing for the future with programs such as victory mission, second story, and the mercer medical school in columbus. he is also childlike, riding his bicycle and playing with children and youth at the monthly bible studies at his home. a lifelong georgia resident, a family man married to roxanne, they have two sons, jc and john christopher, and five grandchildren. this is the part you are going to want to listen to. there is a quote on the church website that made me think that we as representatives may be very similar to him. his quote is, i work six days a week to have the right to preach 20 minutes on sunday morning. now think about it. we work about 325 days out of the year trying to get or stay elected so we can get a bill passed in 40 days. isn't that similar? many of you know that pastor elder was richard schermann, richard smith's pastor. some of you may not know, he also has the dubious distinction of being the pastor of one of our senators. being a man of god and knowing how close we are to sign he died, i

of the house here in the chamber do so by watching video stream because i think that is safer. we are not being alarmist, but we are being cautious. and i don't think that we can be too cautious at this point in time with what we are dealing with. you will get a notice or reiterating all of these points this afternoon. as you know, we are out tomorrow. and we come in thursday. we will be operating under these new conditions until we notify you otherwise. i have discussed that also with the majority leader and the minority leader and they both are aware of what we are doing. the chair

leader has moved that house bill 793 be taken off the table. what purpose does the majority caucus whip rise? thank you, mr. speaker. i would like to second the motion. the motion has been seconded.

america and go do the real work of the lord. and his role over at the church, you know, it's a very interesting church and that it does not fall into the normal mode of feeling like you're just going and you're under pressure to go to church. you actually wake up in the morning and say i really want to go and then while you're there you say i really want to be here and then when it's over with you say i think i'll stay for another one. and it's just a very nice welcoming environment and he's part of the leadership that makes that happen. so without further ado please help me and welcome orlando

for your dedication to our people within the state of georgia. as i go to the word of the lord, the word says, whatever you do, work at it with your whole heart. as working for the lord and not for human masters, the king james version would say, do all things heartily as unto the lord and not pleasing men. and what that means to us is that we have a great work to be diligent to have a time of devotion and certainly to be dedicated to the divine direction. we are called to work with dedication and commitment in our hearts. this gives us our sense of purpose. and as i was studying my devotion, numbers came up to mine. one of those numbers was the number six, which represents work and it also represents man. and as i was thinking through it, there was a chapter in nehemiah. it was the sixth chapter. and it dealt with the assessment of how we must look at the things around us and be diligent in our work. the man nehemiah worked very diligently to make sure and to make certain that the wall that had been broken was rebuilt. he took a time to assess the damage. and there's some damage that had to be dealt with. and he did this by going from diligence to devotion. he went to god. he began to talk to him and he gave him his directives. and when you get directives from god, it seems like you're going to have help from the sidelines, but god gave help from the inside. and i say you're going to get some inside help. when any person knows anything about god's prayers, we say we pray back to god. we say to what god said to us, this is what he did. and when nehemiah did it

help people with disabilities learn a trade and then go out into the community. what many of them became were like sweatshops where disabled people were caved together and they worked on a very boring type of repetitive behavior often. and even worse they were paid a subminimal wage, that's what the government allowed, as little as 22 cents an hour for their work. in 2001 we were down to about 30

related to tax. but as it exists in the executive branch, if the state or the tax payer wishes to appeal, their only option is to go to the superior court. and that superior court always is going to

court that is already overcrowded and it puts an appellate situation into an appellate court rather than a trial court that it currently exists in with a superior court. 1267 is that enabling

drought and the crops had failed we were losing animals across the state and we're pretty desperate for rain so out on the front steps of the capitol sonny turned as governor to the lord and he asked representative gill to come and lead that service and he's in the middle of praying for rain and we're out many of the legislators out there and it starts to rain i would like to say we've had enough for ever seen i think maybe this time since they're saying there's gonna be floods all over northeast georgia you might need to help us out a little bit whether just maybe a slight stop on it rather

member of this body, i have had great experiences when it comes to learning more about the jewish faith. it started with one of the legislators from my area, bringing down his rabbi to do lunch and learns. and we sat there and listened to this wonderful storyteller, tell us stories and to bring to life the bible. then when we became a majority party, i was honored by our speaker to be a sign, to be our representative to the holocaust commission. and i have served in that position most of the time that i have been here. and mr. speaker, thank you again for letting me continue to do that. and so when i learned that we had a fairly new rabbi in east cobb, i wanted to make sure that he had the opportunity, and we had the opportunity to welcome him to georgia and to the general assembly. the jewish community is a very large part of east cobb and it's a very active part of our community and adds a great deal to the tapestry that makes east cobb a wonderful place to live. so today, i and i will be introducing to you a senior rabbi larry surnovich. and he represents the temple, col. emeth, one of three or four temples that we have in our east cobb area. he, you know, describes himself as a teacher, a writer, a speaker, and he's a community leader. what i really like in him that he truly believes in the eternal hope of the jewish people, which is to be a light to the nations of the world, something we especially need during these traveling times. he's been with us a year, he comes from new jersey. i asked him how he liked georgia and did he miss new jersey and the winter weather

church that has gone through a lot of heartache over the last decade. he and his wife, maxine, have been a blessing for christ's church and for our community. but today will actually be the first day i've ever heard him preach, because i don't bring my pastor down here. i don't want you guys filling his head with stories that might question his ability to shepherd his flock. in all seriousness, i brought pastor gyle down here today because we do life together. we have kids who are the same age, and i'm sure if he preaches anything like he parents, we're in for a great surprise. so without further ado, the man that met the legend, pastor eric gyle. thank you, mr. speaker. thank you, casey, my friend, representative carpenter, and thank you, representative, as the great state of georgia for this opportunity to speak and to pray with you today. this mornin"}, {"video_id": "r9qODNtPRUs", "title": "Georgia House - Day 16 (2026-02-07)", "text": "georgia house - day 16 (2026-02-07)

that, a preacher. but i know that we all at times in our lives really need a pastor. and i'll tell you that jay williams, he fits both of those roles. he brings a great message, but his real strength is that he is a pastor. he's ministered to our church and his proven, our church is growing. jay's ministry over the years has been very powerful to a number of people, young people, older people. he's ministered to all ages, all across south georgia. jay williams is at a church that was founded in 1859. and he's carrying on the tradition of men and women who've passed her that church. and i'm so very proud that he's been able to be there for my family and times of joy and times of sorrow. i'm very much looking forward to his message today, my pastor, the pastor jay williams. pastor, it's

didn't know, other than you're a really good guy and a handsome man with a beautiful wife battery. so all those things said, mag is like some of the rest of us. he's educated beyond his intelligence, but he handles that much better than i do, but mag was educated to albany state and he attended also georgia college in millageville. pretty cool. good to find school. he had a career with the state and till he entered his second career with the state and public service. mag is a pastor at st. james christian fellowship church inc.. he was elected to this body in 2008. i think one of the best

had a busy 28th day session, with a number of notable bills being passed or introduced. the session was marked by a bipartisan approach on some school safety measures, while more partisan debates

school properties to aid emergency response.\n**sb 61**: adds new charges that students could be prosecuted for in superior court, including terroristic threats.\n**sb 179**: requires sharing of student disciplinary history when transferring schools and holds parents legally responsible for not disclosing suspensions.\n**sb 163**: rescinds local city and county laws over guns and weapons, entrusting regulation exclusively to the state.\n**hb 111**: reduces the state's flat income tax rate from 5.39% to 5.19%.\n**hb 112**: provides a one-time tax rebate of $250 for single taxpayers and $500 for married couples.\n**hb 657**: annexes 45 small parcels of land into the newly formed city of mulberry.\n\nbills introduced (first reading):\nno new bills were introduced during this

merits of the income tax cut bill hb 111.\n\nvotes:\n- sb 17, sb 179 passed unanimously.\n- sb 61 passed 33-22 along party lines.\n- sb 163 passed 33-23 along party lines. \n- hb 111 passed 110-60,

include lieutenant governor bert jones, democratic minority whip representative sam\npark, and republican senator sam dullazal.\nbut first, let's get an update on the day so far from capitol correspondent sarah callis.\nhi, donna.\ncross every day kicked off with governor camp signing his first piece of legislation this\nsession.\nwhen the mad dash to pass legislation started up for the day, with the senate passing three\nbills related to school safety.\nsb 17, also known as ricky and alyssa's law, named after two victims in high school\nshootings, would mandate mobile alert panic systems for schools to alert local responders\nto emergencies.\nthe other part of this bill is a school mapping piece, and very simply all it does is require\nthat every school property in the state be mapped so that data is provided when an incident happens\nin real time. our folks and friends in the public safety community know where to go to find the\nassailant, where to go save lives, where to evacuate people. the bill passed unanimously.\nsenate bill 61 would add new charges that a student could be prosecuted for in superior court\nincluding terroristic threats.\ni think it's important to point out at this point as well that the bill preserves the existing\nauthority for a da at any time before indictment after investigation and for cause to decline the\nprosecution and superior court and bring the case to juvenile court for those between the ages\nof 13 and 17. democrats were less enthusiastic about this bill as it passed 33 to 22 along\nparty lines. and senate bill 179

actions**\n- no bills were passed or referred during this session.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading)**\n- no new bills were introduced.\n\n**notable moments**\n- there was extensive discussion about the potential issues with sb 82, including concerns about the $50,000 minimum fine for unintentional violations and the risk of opening the door to frivolous lawsuits against banks.\n- an amendment (amendment #3) was proposed to address these concerns by having the attorney general handle enforcement rather than allowing private lawsuits.\n\n**votes**\n- no recorded votes were

problem is, one of the problems is,\npassage of this bill puts banks in a horrible position.\nbecause as the bankers have said,\nnine times out of 10 when they choose to either not bank somebody\nor sever a relationship with a client,\nthey can't talk about under federal regulations\nwhy they made the decision that they made.\nso this puts them in a horrible position of not being able\nto explain the decision that was made,\nbut yet leaves them fully exposed to being sued about it.\nif you look at the need of the bill,\nand it gets over to the portion involving lines 98 through 103,\nand talks about essential providers.\nand by the way, if you're wondering why this part\nof the bill or the bill talks about entities and utility carriers and broadband providers\nand your water service people

session focused on a discussion around a bill that aimed to provide certain protections for manufacturers regarding disclosures and warnings. there was debate around the extent of these protections and how they would impact the ability to bring claims against manufacturers.\n\n**key actions:** \nno bills were passed or referred.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading):**\nno new bills were introduced.\n\n**notable moments:**\n- there was discussion around whether the bill would prevent claims for wrongful death or personal injury if the manufacturer was found to have knowingly withheld, concealed or misrepresented information about health risks.\n- an amendment was proposed to clarify that the bill would not eliminate common law negligent failure to warn claims, allowing consumers to hold manufacturers accountable if they failed to inform consumers of known issues even after reporting to the epa. the amendment was not adopted.\n- there was debate around the timing of when manufacturers would be required to disclose information to consumers versus the government.\n\n**votes:**\nno recorded votes were taken.\n\n**attendance:**\nno quorum issues were

were asked previously, that if it determinations made by the epa\nthat a manufacturer knowingly withheld, concealed, misrepresented, destroyed, material information\nregarding human health risks, that the earlier part of the bill would not apply.\nso any concern that the manufacturer may be have this information be aware of this information that's specifically excluded from the legislation that you're presenting here today is my understanding that's correct, correct.\nthank you, mr. chairman.\nand i just want to make sure i'm understanding mr. senator.\nif you're saying the companies are not allowed to hide the truth or mislead and i understand\nthat part, but how do they tell the truth if they don't warn?\ni mean, you know, it's one thing for someone to ask you and then you tell the truth because\nyou've been asked.\nbut i guess it doesn't this sort of prohibit or discourage warning people by giving\nthis sort of not-immunity but certain protections.\nwell, first of all, they're going to do research themselves as the owner or manufacturer of\nthe product.\nthey're not going to, they know the consequences, they're not going to put anything on the\nmarketplace that can cause harm.\nnumber two, epa is also going to be testing it with their 500 scientists and researchers,\nand they're going to do research on that.\nso i mean, it may take 13 years for them to verify that the product is safe and okay\nto put on the shelf for people to use.\nso again, if they fail to warn about something,\nif the science is not there to back it up,\nthen they should not be held liable for that.\nthere has to be science and research\nto prove that there's something that causes that problem.\nand if they don't have the research or science to back it up,\nthen it's just hearsay.\nbut when

that campaign promise has been\nbroken, and unfortunately that means many of my constituents will feel or are already feeling\nthe economic consequences of the trump administration's agenda. we just listen to president trump talk\nabout making america great again, but great for whom, for his billionaire buddies, because\nhis plans so far have been disastrous for georgians. already 1,300 cdc

heard a lot of facts, a lot of testimony, a lot of opinion testimony. i'm not going to hopefully bore the committee with a recitation or reference to all of that but i want to try to focus our

mr. speaker. house bill 370 is a taxpayer transparency piece of legislation. they will ensure if a local government, whether it's municipality, county or school board, voted to opt out of house bill 581, the constitutional amendment that the voters overwhelmingly approved in november that passed in all 159 counties in this state. and you name them almost unanimously approved by this body and by the senate. if they opted out of house bill 581, they would have to put on property owner's tax bill that that local government, specifically the board, the county commission, school board, or otherwise, voted to opt out of home under tax relief, the date of the vote and the phone number, the concerned citizens can call to share feedback on that decision. additionally, any school system that voted to opt out would have to include how much money they have in cash reserves and how much they have in reserves per student. many of you may have recently seen that our school systems across the state have $6.5 billion in reserves. and at the same time, many of them are opting out of home under tax relief. and relief that i'll note that it's important to note, i think this is not going to

of the key points from the georgia legislative session transcript on the democratic caucus press conference regarding hb 127:\n\n**overview**:\nthe democratic caucus strongly opposed hb 127, describing it as a bill that would take georgia \"backwards\" on issues of race, discrimination, and civil rights. they accused the republican party of being \"afraid\" to condemn slavery and the confederacy.\n\n**key actions**:\n- **hb 127**: a bill that was originally about providing extra sick days for teachers, but was amended by republicans to include \"dei\" (diversity, equity, and inclusion) provisions that the democrats opposed.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading)**:\nnone mentioned.\n\n**notable moments**:\n- democrats accused republicans of trying to \"hide\" and \"sneak through\" the bill by bringing it up late at night.\n- democrats said they were prepared to fight for \"5-6 hours\" to either defeat the bill or amend it, but were denied that opportunity.\n- democrats criticized republicans for not allowing amendments that would have affirmed that slavery was a cause of the civil war and that evolution should be discussed.\n\n**votes**:\nno specific votes mentioned.\n\n**attendance**:\nno quorum notes provided.\n\n**adjournment**:\nno adjournment time or next session date mentioned. so up until last week this bill hb 127 was actually a bill to give teachers a\ncouple of extra days sick time it was one that was bipartisan everybody could\nsupport it but the republicans decided that they wanted to take that away from\nteachers and put on this dei bill supposedly was this called a dei bill which\nhas really taken us back to prior days of discrimination so let's kind of\nget into the weeds for a second one of the things that we talked about was our\nwere not germane. they were very germane and they also had not created a substitute.\nof all the amendments we had, all we did was try to add to this bill and actually make\nit something that all georgians could actually kind of work through. but they didn't want\nto do that. now the real deal to all of this, this bill takes us back. this is a sad day\nfor the georgia state senate. one of the saddest i've ever been in 10 years, quite frankly.\nwe heard one of my colleagues, senator lucas, talk about the fact what he grew up with,\nwhat he's dealt with, senator magnum, others, nann orrah, others have fought the civil rights\nmovement and here we are again fighting the same movement again and it's really a\ntravesty that we'll be here doing these particular fights and i also believe\nand i firmly believe this and one of the things i said in the well is they were\nafraid of those amendments that actually talked about slavery and actually talked\nabout the confederate states of america because they could not vote on those\nparticular amendments. one basically saying that slavery was a cause of the\ncivil war, they were afraid to vote on that. so i want you to talk about people\nhaving fear. the republican party today was afraid to say that slavery actually\ninstrumental to the civil war. they were afraid today to say the confederate states of america\nactually was a rebellion set of states. they were afraid of that. that's what they were afraid of\ntoday. so mark that in your notes. that is the key. that is your takeaway from thi"}, {"video_id":

midwives.\nso i'm proud and honored to stand here with our modern day\nmidwives and i want to shed life light on the valuable role of midwives and\nthe pressing need to recognize their significance in our healthcare system.\nyes, midwives are compassionate caregivers, advocates for health care,\nguardians for mothers and newborns and pillars of support during one of\nmost beautiful journeys. to do this, they undergo rigorous training, often spending three to five years.\nthey are equipped to handle countless emergencies during childbirth, offering care,\nthat prioritizes maternal well-being and safety.\nthis is crucial in addressing racial disparities\nin maternal health, where black women face\nalarming rates of complications and mortality,\nsuppressing even some nations in the world,\nstudies show that midwifery led care results in lower rates of interventions like sea sections\nand infant mortality, offering a cost-effective alternative to hospital-based care.\nhistorically, communities rely on midwife expertise, particularly among black and immigrant\npopulations. however, the shift towards hospital-based care in the 20th century led\na decline in the number of midwives from 43,000 in the 1980s to around 14,000 today.\nwe need more, not less, so in 2015 georgia granted the board of nursing, the authority\nto regulate mid-wifery practices,

elvis presley used to have a song called walk of mylon, my shoes, and of course he was a great humanitarian. he pretty much gave away everything that he ever made. but before he sang that song, walk of mylon, my shoes, he recited a poem, and i think it's kind of fitting for just life in general, and how we need to treat each other, and it goes like this. you never stood in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, or stood and watched what helped us hands while a heart inside him dies. so help your brother along the way, no matter where he starts, for the same god that made you, made

overcompricate that or if i failed to answer that, please follow up. so the question was in regards to the state specific exam, right? and so, i apologize. as he said right now, you have to get all the experience. the final step is you take the nces national ps exam, professional surveyer's exam and the georgia specific exam. and what the decoupling does is kind of into flavors. one, the national exams can be taken as soon as the education is in place. the state specific exam is more tailored towards practicing in georgia. and instead of having to get all that experience and then wait for the testing cycle that can be months or even a year, the state specific exam would not be eligible on the front end while the education is there. it's more practice based and that's to be taken during the last six months of the apprenticeship period, which is the last two years of the whole endeavor. so they won't have to wait on results to get back, but they'll wait till near the end of their apprenticeship, which is when they'd be the most prepared to take the state specific exam. and my question is this, if let's just look at the associate degree track, it says 60 months of total experience, 24, which has to be an apprenticeship. could you do your apprenticeship part on the front end of that 60 months or it has to be on the end of the 60 months? the proposed language is it can be done anytime after the minimum education has been achieved, just like taking the test. so you could take the test and start the apprenticeship at the same time on the front end of the experience.

power for the coming decade\nat the expense of minority voters. these are not my worries, but the words that actually come from\na federal court opinion in an exhaustive comprehensive 516-page order which states that the legislative\ncongressional maps passed in 2021 violated section two of the voting rights act. it diluted the\npower of african american voters by not providing them with an equal
