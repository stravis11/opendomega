stalking to be able to move without\npenalty from their leases.\nthis is an overlooked population of people who\nneeded to be protected. and so this bill sb413 builds on this work in the same way that\nvictims of domestic violence and stalking need to be able to move quickly to safety.\nso it is true for those who are victims of gun violence. and so today i am excited\nand honored to be able to carry this piece of legislation that will allow all victims\nof gun violence to be able to get out of their leases without penalty so they can move to\na place of safety.\ntoday i have with me really the brain child of this movement, someone who works in this\ntype of field and who brought this issue to me and so it's really my great honor to\nintroduce both two incredible warriors but first we'll begin with dr. amber hannah.\nshe is a surgical resident who works at a great hospital nearby and she's here in her personal\ncapacity to advocate for vulnerable patients and knows firsthand just how life-saving sb\n14 can be.\nand so again, it's my great honor to introduce her to you all and she speaks about the importance\nof this bill.\ndr. hannah.\nthank you so much.\nthank

georgian\nalong with a recent federal rule\ncompleted this summer. the federal\nrule revised the list of offenses\npermanently disqualifying individuals\nfrom operating a commercial motor\nvehicle for which a commercial's\ndriver's license or commercial's\nlearners permit is required. this\nrule reflects a change made by\ncongress and the no human trafficking\non our roads act which prohibits an\nindividual from operating a commercial\nmotor vehicle for life. if that\nindividual uses a commercial motor\nvehicle and committing a felony involving human trafficking.\nthis legislation will ensure georgia comes into compliance with this federal rule and\nwill authorize the department of driver services to permanently revoke an individual cdl\nlicense upon conviction if they use the commercial motor vehicle while committing the offense\nof trafficking a person for labor or sexual servitude.\nthis legislation comes on behalf of first lady marty kemp as we all work together to bring\nhuman trafficking in our state to an end.\nwe must fight back against those who victimize our state and i believe house bill 823 is another\nstep in tool to assist us in the fight against human
