round of tort\nreform in georgia.\nand it's been 20 years of work every day with our members and with the general assembly.\nand so, you know, our hope here is that we see a reduction in some of the frivolous lawsuits\nthat we see some insurers return to georgia that have left, that we see some stabilization\nof rates, and it may be most importantly, we can actually see some of our rural hospitals\nimprove their ability to attract doctors, particularly ob-gyns, into some of the parts\nof the state that really just haven't been able to keep those physicians in place.\nand so big bill,

in\nthis state and the fight against human trafficking. we must work together to bring\nthis evil industry into the light and provide a safe haven for victims across the\nstate. house bill 823 brings georgian\nalong with a recent federal rule\ncompleted this summer. the federal\nrule revised the list of offenses\npermanently disqualifying individuals\nfrom operating a commercial motor\nvehicle for which a commercial's\ndriver's license or commercial's\nlearners permit is required. this\nrule reflects a change made by\ncongress and the no human trafficking\non our roads act which prohibits an\nindividual from operating a commercial\nmotor vehicle for life. if that\nindividual uses a commercial motor\nvehicle and committing a felony involving human trafficking.\nthis legislation will ensure georgia comes into compliance with this federal rule and\nwill authorize the department of driver services to permanently revoke an individual cdl\nlicense upon conviction if they use the commercial motor vehicle while committing the offense\nof trafficking a person for labor or sexual servitude.\nthis legislation comes on behalf of first lady marty kemp as we all work together to bring\nhuman trafficking in our state to an end.\nwe must fight back against those who victimize our state and i believe house bill 823 is another\nstep in tool to assist us in the fight against human trafficking and i would ask for your\nfavourable consideration. mr. speaker, i'm happ"}, {"video_id": "4Zxqh2LjHns", "title": "Georgia House - Day 22 (2026-03-02)", "text": "georgia house - day 22

the key points from the georgia energy, utilities and telecommunications meeting day 31 of the 2025 session session:\n\n**overview:**\nthe session focused on a discussion around a bill that aimed to provide certain protections for manufacturers regarding disclosures and warnings. there was debate around the extent of these protections and how they would impact the ability to bring claims against manufacturers.\n\n**key actions:** \nno bills were passed or referred.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading):**\nno new bills were introduced.\n\n**notable moments:**\n- there was discussion around whether the bill would prevent claims for wrongful death or personal injury if the manufacturer was found to have knowingly withheld, concealed or misrepresented information about health risks.\n- an amendment was proposed to clarify that the bill would not eliminate common law negligent failure to warn claims, allowing consumers to hold manufacturers accountable if they failed to inform consumers of known issues even after reporting to the epa. the amendment was not adopted.\n- there was debate around the timing of when manufacturers would be required to disclose information to consumers versus the government.\n\n**votes:**\nno recorded votes were taken.\n\n**attendance:**\nno quorum issues were noted.\n\n**adjournment:**\nthe session adjourned, with the next session date unspecified. thank you mr. chairman and senator, it's my reading of this beginning with the respect\nof the questions that were asked previously, that if it determinations made by the epa\nthat a manufacturer knowingly withheld, concealed, misrepresented, destroyed, material information\nregarding human health risks, that the earlier part of the bill would not apply.\nso any concern that the manufacturer may be have this information be aware of this information that's specifically excluded from the legislation that you're presenting here today is my understanding that's correct, correct.\nthank you, mr. chairman.\nand i just want to make sure i'm understanding mr. senator.\nif you're saying the companies are not allowed to hide the truth or mislead and i understand\nthat part, but how do they tell the truth if they don't warn?\ni mean, you know, it's one thing for someone to ask you and then you tell the truth because\nyou've been asked.\nbut i guess it doesn't this sort of prohibit or discourage warning people by giving\nthis sort of not-immunity but certain protections.\nwell, first of all, they're going to do research themselves as the owner or manufacturer of\nthe product.\nthey're not going to, they know the consequences, they're not going to put anything on the\nmarketplace that can cause harm.\nnumber two, epa is also going to be testing it with their 500 scientists and researchers,\nand they're going to do research on that.\nso i mean, it may take 13 years for them to verify that the product is safe and okay\nto put on the shelf for people to use.\nso again, if they fail to warn about something,\nif the science is not there to back it up,\nthen they should not be held liable for that.\nthere has to be science and research\nto prove that there's something that causes that problem.\nand if they don't have the research or science to back it up,\nthen it's just hearsay.\nbut when you say there, are you talking\nabout the pesticide company or the

to evacuate people. the bill passed unanimously.\nsenate bill 61 would add new charges that a student could be prosecuted for in superior court\nincluding terroristic threats.\ni think it's important

(cdc) by the government. several state representatives and former cdc officials spoke about the threats, harassment, and challenges faced by public health workers at the cdc.\n\n**key actions**: no specific bills or legislative actions were mentioned.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading)**: none detected.\n\n**notable moments**:\n- rep. omari crawford paid tribute to officer david rose, a cobb county police officer who was killed while responding to a shooting near the cdc.\n- several speakers, including rep. saira draper, dr. deb hauri, and dr. dan jernigan, discussed the attacks, misinformation, and politically-motivated rhetoric directed at cdc employees, which they said was undermining the agency's ability to respond to health crises.\n- the speakers emphasized the importance of supporting and protecting the cdc's public health work, which impacts every georgian and american.\n\n**votes**: no recorded votes mentioned.\n\n**attendance**: no specific quorum notes

state\nrepresentative for house district 90 in atlanta and to cab county. we are here\ntoday to address the systemic attacks and dismantling of public health by our\nown government. i along with the other elected officials you will hear from\ntoday represent areas near and where the cdc is located. we have many\nconstituents who are directly impacted by what has been happening at the centers for\ndisease control and prevention.\nand yes, we are fighting for those constituents, but do not be confused, because this is not\njust a cab county issue, this is not just an atlanta issue, this is not just a federal\nworker issue.\nthe work of the cdc impacts every georgian, every american, and indeed it has worldwide\nimplications because such is the work of public health. many people may not realize what\npublic health is because when it is working you do not see it. you do not notice the\nlisteria outbreak that was stopped before the cold cuts left the processing facility. you\ndo not see the influenza or avian flu event that was prevented because of good vaccination\npolicies. and ebola seems like a far off disease because cdc workers put themselves in harm's\nway to stop the spread before it reaches our borders. where doctors in an office or hospital\nare focused on the care of the single patient, public health officials work to improve health\nof entire populations. and so when you mess with the cdc, you mess with all of us. we\nwe just left an eye-opening roundtable discussion with a number of former cdc employees.\nit really laid bare the attack that these public servants have been under.\nfrom the erasure of data to the dismantling of effective health programs to dodging literal\nbullets, the folks at the cdc have endured the unthinkable.\nand why?\nwhy do

here today with a\ngroup of concerned journalists, activists, organizers about the case of mario\nguevara. mario guevara is a journalist who is being held in\nfolkston, georgia, and ice detention. we've been talking a lot about ice\nrecently in this country. trump just passed a budget bill that expanded ice\nis funding by $75 billion, tripling its annual budget and making its annual budget larger\nthan that of the fbi and the federal prison system.\nice is poised to become the largest domestic police force and most funded domestic police\nforce in the united states.\nand what this means for communities, particularly immigrant communities, is fear.\nhere that family or friends will be abducted, snatched up, disappeared, taken to remote\nfacilities, windowless rooms, with little contact in some cases with the outside world,\nwith no guarantee of due process and no accountability for, in some cases, the plain clothes officers\nwho come and abduct these folks off of our streets and our communities from businesses,\nfrom schools.\nmario guevara is a journalist, and so his detention raises even bigger questions about civil\nrights, constitutional rights, the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press.\nand in this country, as we know with our tradition of the freedom of speech and press, it isn't\nabout whether you agree with someone's opinions, the substance of their reporting, it's about\ntheir right to collect information and disseminate that information, to communities who rely on\nto make deliberative and form decisions about their democracy.\nand mario

127:\n\n**overview**:\nthe democratic caucus strongly opposed hb 127, describing it as a bill that would take georgia \"backwards\" on issues of race, discrimination, and civil rights. they accused the republican party of being \"afraid\" to condemn slavery and the confederacy.\n\n**key actions**:\n- **hb 127**: a bill that was originally about providing extra sick days for teachers, but was amended by republicans to include \"dei\" (diversity, equity, and inclusion) provisions that the democrats opposed.\n\n**bills introduced (first reading)**:\nnone mentioned.\n\n**notable moments**:\n- democrats accused republicans of trying to \"hide\" and \"sneak through\" the bill by bringing it up late at night.\n- democrats said they were prepared to fight for \"5-6 hours\" to either defeat the bill or amend it, but were denied that opportunity.\n- democrats criticized republicans for not allowing amendments that would have affirmed that slavery was a cause of the civil war and that evolution should be discussed.\n\n**votes**:\nno specific votes mentioned.\n\n**attendance**:\nno quorum notes provided.\n\n**adjournment**:\nno adjournment time or next session date mentioned. so up until last week this bill hb 127 was actually a bill to give teachers a\ncouple of extra days sick time it was one that was bipartisan everybody could\nsupport it but the republicans decided that they wanted to take that away from\nteachers and put on this dei bill supposedly was this called a dei bill which\nhas really taken us back to prior days of discrimination so let's kind of\nget into the weeds for a second one of the things that we talked about was our\nwere not germane. they were very germane and they also had not created a substitute.\nof all the amendments we had, all we did was try to add to this bill and actually make\nit something that all georgians could actually kind of work through. but they didn't want\nto do that. now the real deal to all of this, this bill takes us back. this is a sad day\nfor the georgia state senate. one of the saddest i've ever been in 10 years, quite frankly.\nwe heard one of my colleagues, senator lucas, talk about the fact what he grew up with,\nwhat he's dealt with, senator magnum, others, nann orrah, others have fought the civil rights\nmovement and here we are again fighting the same movement again and it's really a\ntravesty that we'll be here doing these particular fights and i also believe\nand i firmly believe this and one of the things i said in the well is they were\nafraid of those amendments that actually talked about slavery and actually talked\nabout the confederate states of america because they could not vote on those\nparticular amendments. one basically saying that slavery was a cause of the\ncivil war, they were afraid to vote on that. so i want you to talk about people\nhaving fear. the republican party today was afraid to say that slavery actually\ninstrumental to the civil war. they were afraid today to say the confederate states of america\nactually was a rebellion set of states. they were afraid of that. that's what they were afraid of\ntoday. so mark that in your notes. that is the key. that is
