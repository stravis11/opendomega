keep you\nwe can stayed on midnight\nterror\nrecognizes chairman tanner for a motion\nthank you mr speaker i move that this\nhouse agree to the senate substitute to\nhouse bill 511.\nchairman tanner has moved that this\nhouse agreed to the senate substitute\nhouse bill 511\nclerk will read the caption\nhouse of 511 to be titled an act to\namend titles 32 36 45 48 and 50.\nthe official code of georgia annotated\nrelating to highways bridges and ferries\nlocal governments\nchair recognizes chairman tanner to\nexplain his motion\nthank you mr speaker\num it was last year now it's kind of\nhard to keep up with the date since it's\nbeen an extended session but we had a\nlot of conversations around house bill\n511 dealing with transit in rural\ngeorgia\nbut what you have before you today is\nfairly straightforward and simple it's\nbeen condensed down to really just\naddress a couple of things\none we created through house bill 930\nthe atl\na few years ago\nand one of the things that the atl board\nhas requested is some cleanup language\naround their voting procedures for\nmembers for new members we've had issues\nof whether or not they\nwhere they wanted to meet for those\nvotes whether or not you could call in\nor whether or not you could have a proxy\nor whether or not you could do it over\nthe phone so this just cleans it up and\nmakes it simple across the board the\nsame at every meeting\nit also says that the new board members\nthe election will be held during the\ntime the general assembly is in session\nit will be held here at the capitol\nbecause the majority of the members\nvoting for that are legislators so it\nwill be held during the regular session\nof the general assembly here at the\ncapitol\nif a vacancy occurs outside the general\nassembly time then the chairman of that\nwill call the chairman of the atl will\ncall for the meeting and the meeting\nwill either be held here at the capitol\nor will be held somewhere within the\ndistrict that the election is occurring\nfor so that's there it also makes it\nclear that\nin order to vote the voting will be done\nby secret ballot\nthere'll be no proxies no\nteleconferences no technology are\nappointing another member to vote for\nyou so if you if you want to vote you've\ngot to be there in person to do that\nagain making it clear on the front end\nfair and across the board\nfor everybody um\nand then um it also one of the things\nactually is really unnecessary at this\npoint because we've already voted on\nthis and another piece of legislation\nbut it's in this bill\nuh at the very end\nthe last\nsection section 6. if you remember in\nhouse bill 170 there was the indexing\nthat's done\nright now that index is lower because of\nthe economy so it's actually lower than\nthan typical but this extends the\nconsumer pricing index out for fuel\nmotor vehicle fuel uh to 2025 it's set\nto expire july 1st 2022 again we've\nalready voted on that and another bill\nthat's already passed out of this house\nand out of the senate and is now over in\nthe\nat the governor's office and that was\nhouse bill 1098 i believe that's passed\nthis chamber already so be glad to\nanswer any questions again this used to\nbe a very complicated bill but it's come\ndown to really just cleaning up atl\nlanguage around the election process\nwith that mr speaker i'm happy to answer\nquestions\nthe chair recognizes chairman martin to\nyour left for a question\nchairman ten are you yelling i do uh i\nhave a question i took me a minute to\nfind the bill and it's probably right\nthere in front of me but i'll ask for\nbrevity to be clear\nisn't it true that i'm concerned about\nthe calling of the meetings when we're\nout of session\nwe had\ntrying to deliver this in the form of a\nquestion isn't it true we had an issue\nwith that happening this year where\nthere was a poll done\nof where members could come and the\nfeeling was depending on who could come\non what day was where the members\nuh where the meeting was called and then\nthen there was an issue around could you\nvote electronically i understand is it\ntrue that gentleman's take care of that\nwith the bill if you can't vote\nelectronically i just would ask\nthat there's notice given and the chair\nwill call the meeting and you will be\nthere it won't be a poll to see who can\ncome on what day\nand then the meeting would be called so\ncould you articulate uh how that's done\na little bit or point me to that in the\nbill thank you yeah i'll be glad to um\nit's actually going to be done by the\nchair if it's outside the time of the\ngeneral assembly meeting if it's a gen\nif it's during the time a normal\nelection will take place during the\nmonths we're here at the general\nassembly that will always occur at the\ncapitol if there's a vacancy that occurs\nthen the chair of the actual atl not the\nchair of one of the county commissions\nbut the chair of the atl who's appointed\nby the governor so it'll be a\nindependent person will\ncall the election and that call of the\nelection will be done\neither here at the capitol or at another\nplace within the district and there'll\nbe at least seven calendar days notice\ngiven stating the time the place and the\npurpose of the meeting so that would be\ncalled by the atl chair uh either here\nat the capitol or at another place\ndesignated at the call of the chair and\nat least seven days in advance and again\nhave to you have to be present to vote\nand that uh just for quick reference\nthat would be lines 88 through 90 would\ngive you the uh we'll show you the\ninformation around the call of the\nmeeting\nmr speaker i'm happy to answer another\nquestion if there is one i do not see\nany mr speaker for that i would ask for\nyour favorable consideration to agree to\nthe senate substitute house bill 511\nthank you on the gentleman's motion that\nthe house agreed to the senate\nsubstitute to house bill 511 all those\nin favor will vote i those opposed to\nvote no and the clerk will\nunlock the machines and call the roll\nalexander manilowitz

taxes and past\ndue taxes shall be equal to the bank\nprime loan rate\nchair recognizes representative reeves\nto explain his motion\nthank you mr speaker i think this is\ngoing to be my last time up here today i\nhope so uh\nbut\nhouse bill 846\nthis is a\na bill that has combined a few other\nmatters the uh the first part of this is\nthe annual irc\nrevenue code update and it has actually\nbeen updated since we updated it earlier\nthis year in january it now includes\nthe cares act and the march 27 2020 date\nthat corresponds with that this is the\nthe thing we do every year that gets us\nin compliance\nwith um with federal code and the um if\nif this doesn't pass then\nit actually has a fiscal impact of\napproximately 154 million dollars to\ngeorgia taxpayers so this compliance is\nvery important\nsecond part of the bill um\nis actually the underlying bill which is\nrepresentative corbett's bill about\ndirect pay permits which this body\npassed um overwhelmingly already earlier\nthis session\nand that just simply takes something\nthat's in dor rules and regulations and\nmoves it to code\nthe um the other two aspects of this\nbill are some are two of the things that\nwe are obviously everybody in this room\nis aware we're in new times and we're in\nlife in the covet era and the um our\nstate has been\ntrying very hard to do what we can to\nwork with with businesses and also\nto make sure that we're prepared um for\nfuture flare-ups which i think we all\nrealize that until there's a vaccine we\nthat's going to be part of our life and\nwhat we deal with and this\nbill is offering some great things\nthe first deals with ppe this bill\ncreates a a tax credit\nfor jobs that for for businesses that\nproduce ppe items obviously everybody in\nthis room hit some point\nin march or april where you where you\nwere being contacted daily by folks in\nyour district needing\nppe and how to get it\nif we what georgia needs to do is\nestablish that we produce and we create\nand manufacture ppe here in georgia and\nso this bill adds a very simple um 1 250\ntax credit for a job that is directly\ninvolved in the cr in the manufacturing\ncreation of ppe\nthe other thing that this bill does is\nobviously everyone\neveryone's district there's no immunity\nhere everybody's district across the\nstate\nhas many businesses that have suffered\ngreatly and there's been a program in\ngeorgia for almost 20 years called the\njob tax credits and the quality job tax\ncredit programs that establishes tiers\nof um tax credits when jobs are created\nin areas and the um the the more rural\nand um\neconomically\nchallenging districts they are counties\nthey are the uh the more the benefit\nthat they are eligible for and it's a\nsliding scale and so what this part of\nthe bill does is every business whatever\ntheir 2019 number was which is based on\nthe number of employees there's a\ncorresponding tax credit\nthat's based on their whatever their\n2019 tax credit was what the state is\ngoing to do is we're going to go ahead\nand allow\nbusinesses that receive that to to\nreceive that same number in 2020 and\n2021\nand this is you know we've got to do\nsomething and this is something that we\ncan do\nto try to help our businesses as they\nrebound from the the the coveted\ndevastation mr speaker with that i'll be\nhappy to take any questions\nyou have uh\nquestions chair recognizes chairman\nknight to your right for a question\ndo you i do do you understand that cpas\nand tax preparers across the state of\ngeorgia are\nquite nervous\nand quite anxious to get this irc update\nand i've definitely been made to\nunderstand that i know that uh unusual\ntimes in fact it's the first time little\ntrivia since 1955\nthat the\ntext deadline has not been on april 15th\nor a day or two before depending on a\nweekend or holiday so\nindeed\nuncertain times but as far as the\nprofession and making sure that the\ngeorgia taxpayers and the preparers who\nare helping them have certainty i\ncertainly want to thank you for the irc\nupdate part of this and again i want to\nmake sure everyone knows that\nthat dollar figure that you just said\nthe 150 54 55 million dollars has been\nincluded in the governor's revenue\nestimate\nand we need to get this out there asap\nthat's right july 15th is\nright upon us\nthank you for that and yes i know that\nthere are several cpas in the room\nyourself representative wilkerson\nrepresentative carson and um i do\nunderstand how important this is for\nthe cpa world\nmr speaker i'll yield for another\nquestion chair recognizes representative\ncarson\nhe waves chair recognizes representative\njasmine clark\nto your ride up in the gallery for a\nquestion thank you mr speaker does a\ngentleman yield i do\num\njust for my just for clarification does\nthis bill\ncreate a new tax credit for ppe it does\nthat's correct\num does it have any further yield yes\ndo we have any idea the fiscal impact of\na new tax credit the the fiscal impact\nof this it's since the proposal includes\nhand sanitizer the fiscal impact is a\nrange of for\n4.3\nto i believe 13.1 million is the range\nit's highly unlikely that we will see\nthe the higher end of that range and\nit's simply because\nthe tax credit is only 1 250 per job so\num it is it's it it's more likely we'll\nobviously know in time but it is more\nlikely that that will be towards the\nlower end of that estimation\nthank you\nthank you mr speaker i will yield the\nwell let's get this important bill\npassed everybody on the gentleman's\nmotion that the house agreed to the\nsenate substitute to house bill 846 all\nthose in favor\nwill vote i those opposed to vote no and\nthe clerk will unlock the machines and\ncall

1020 left this house they had\nbipartisan support\nwe were simply asking for a risk\nreduction program for those charged with\ndui to hold them accountable for a\nlimited driving permit\nthe senate added two amendments which i\nvery much agreed with\none of the amendments was to allow for\ndrug related offenses to be eligible for\nthe limited driving permit also it added\nfor third-party testing\nfor drivers tests which would have\ngreatly helped us during the covet 19\npandemic and would have lightened the\nburden to the state by allowing\nthird-party testers to give the driving\ntest however\nthey removed the als risk reduction\ncomponent to it so what happened was\nthey broadened the eligibility for a\nlimited driving permit by rem and then\nalso removed\nthe accountability component that we had\nadded so therefore we're going to move\nto disagree\non the gentleman's motion at the house\ndisagree\nto the senate substitute\nto house bill 1020 is their

others\nbeing told an act to amend title 33 the\nfiscal quota georgia annotator relating\nto insurance so as to provide for\ncertain consumer protections against\nsurprise billing this bill has been\nreferred to the special committee on\nquality health care that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nchair recognizes\nrepresentative kelly the majority caucus\nwhip to present the bill\nyou mr speaker\ncolleagues i come before you today with\nthe\nsubstitute to senate bill 359\nand it's not hard to see what this bill\nwould do on line 17 we decided to name\nthis bill to georgia kova 19 pandemic\nbusiness safety act\nwe're here back to business and we need\nto do everything we can to help get\ngeorgia back to business as well\nit's important that our state economy\nget back on track and experience the\ngrowth that we were going through before\nthis\nhorrible coven 19 pandemic hit\nand this is this house's effort to do\nthat you'll do it in this way\nit'll provide some certainty and\nliability protections for businesses as\nto what they can expect should\nindividuals want to come and visit their\nplace of business\nthat's for all businesses in the state\nalong with all homeowners association\ncondo associations as well these are\nthings that we have to do to get our\nlives going again\nwe've worked diligently in this house\nwith the business community and we have\nstrong support across the spectrum of\nthe business committee\ncommunity\nincluding uh the support of the metro\natlanta chamber of commerce every one of\nour sports teams that takes place in our\nstate and that's important because\npeople need to be able to get back to\nwork and the way you get people back to\nwork is that the businesses have to feel\ncomfortable opening themselves back up\nto work and so that's what this does now\ni've heard some concern that this may\nhave an impact on on work\nuh claims but if you'll look\non the bill\non line 157 it says nothing in this act\nhas any impact on workers compensation\nclaims that means that any right an\nemployee had previously an employee will\nhave today\nspeaker i know there's others that\nmay want to speak to the bill but i just\nwant to say this is important for us we\ntalk about being the best state in the\nnation to do business and part of that\nis getting through this covenanting\ncrisis and getting back to work\nmr speaker\ni know that the hour is late\nbut this is important work that still\nhas to be done and i know that we're\ncommitted as a house to staying here and\nworking through this legislation\nas as we continue to do throughout the\nnight so mr speaker i'll be glad to uh\ntake a few questions\nchair recognizes\nrepresentative newton chairman newton\nfor a question\nthank you mr speaker with the gentleman\nyield\ni will\nisn't it true that this bill will bring\nthe needed jobs back the employment that\npeople need will make a significant\ndifference in instead of 10 unemployment\nmoving georgia back to the 4 we were\nenjoying to where people were taking\ncare of their families their churches\ntheir communities\nyou're absolutely right and what uh what\nthis will do is this will provide the\nprotections that businesses need to open\nback up and to bring their employees\nback to work and allow us all to get our\nlives back to normal\nfurther yield i will well there's also\nfor the healthcare community our\nnot-for-profit hospitals all of our\nhospitals healthcare institutions\nproviders dentists want to give them\nwhile while following clear standards\nthey will also be able to safely open\nback up to serve both the employees that\nwork at these institutions but even more\nimportantly all the patients of georgia\nthat need these businesses open back up\nit absolutely will and that's very\nimportant i'm glad that we've been able\nto work diligently with the healthcare\ncommunity on this and this will provide\nmuch needed protections for them thank\nyou so much for getting georgians back\nto work and thank you for the work you\ndid as an er doctor through this crisis\ndo you uh\nyield for a question from the majority\nleader of the house i was going to yield\nbut i'll take one more\nthank you gentlemen yield i will\nmr whip is it not true that the small\nbusinesses businesses of this state\nand or the backbone of this state\nand the backbone of the the economy of\nour country\nand is it further not true that those\nthose companies those individuals that\noperate those companies\nor\nthe folks that drive employment\nthat keep georgians working\nin a\nsmall shops larger shops\nand this legislation\nwill insure those folks\nthat they\nhave their proper\ncoverage\nrelationship\nwith their employees to protect them but\nalso ensure that they're able to come\nback and do business in this state and\nmove us out of this pandemic this\nsituation where thank you for that\nquestion mr leader and you're exactly\nright as as someone who who\nhas spent a lot of time working to help\nbetter our business community you\ncertainly know of what you speak and\nthis bill will provide much needed\nlegal protection for them to do that mr\nspeaker i know there's others that may\nwant to speak to the bill and\ni\nask for this house as favorable\nconsideration we all need to unite\ntogether so that we can get our economy\ngrowing again i'll yield the well\ngentleman has yielded the well\nwe do have others that wish to speak on\nthe bill and the chair\nrecognizes representative mclean to\nspeak on the bill\nthank you mr speaker\nand colleagues of the house i rise to\nto ask you to vote no on this\npiece of legislation you know\ni heard my colleagues say that we um to\nopen us back up well we never close\ni don't think we ever close the people\nwho who worked in the plants they didn't\nclose the people worked in the food\nindustry they didn't close the people\nwho worked in the hospitals they didn't\nclose they were they were still open\nthey opened they were open each and\nevery day\nthe postal worker he was he was\ndelivering your mail did anybody miss\nany mail any day\nnot one day did you miss any mail so it\nwas you never close\nyou talk about a pandemic we are in the\npandemic and we came back march 16th\ni'll never forget march 16th longest\nlongest it's it's a long day\nmark 16 we came back i got a text at\nfive o'clock that morning from an admin\nmy admin\nuh in the city she says i've been\nadmitted to the hospital\nand\nthey diagnosed me with pneumonia\nthat was that was on that monday morning\non that thursday well i texted back and\nsaid i'll pray for you that because you\nknow i mean that's the right thing to do\non that thursday i get a text from her\nhusband and\nhe says she's been diagnosed with colon\nor corona it was coronavirus then it was\na coronavirus\non the 19th on that on that thursday\nwell\nand i said wow i mean we didn't know\nvery much\nbut on that sunday she passed\nshe was my ad man for 22 years in the\ncity of atlanta and i never had a chance\nto say bye\nand then her husband that didn't have a\nchance to say bye to her as well because\nhe was quarantined for 14 days\non yesterday there were 1750 cases in\nthe state of georgia\n1750 cases\nin the state of georgia today there were\nnew cases i'm sorry new cases i need to\nstraighten this up\n1900 new cases today\ntoday\nso what i'm saying to you is we need to\nvote we need to vote no reason we need\nto vote no for because these people the\npeople that that i serve in labor the\npeople that i serve for so many years\nthe employees the workers\nthere's no protection for them\nbecause usually if they're working\npeople there's no separation\nwhen when if playing vogel there's no\ndifference in the electrical worker\ngoing to work and somebody just walking\nthrough looking at it\nno one in this building that no one in\nthis room\nworks in the chicken pen it's for the\nfood and commercial workers now one\nperson in here\nthere are new cases each and every day\nand we've got to do better it's\nimpossible do you know how hard it would\nbe\nto have a workers claim a workers comp\nclaim and\nabout covet\nyou it would be almost impossible you\nknow why would be impossible\nbecause they don't know if you call\ncovert a year ago five months ago or if\nyou if\nif kobe was there the day before\nwe this is not a good bill\nthis bill is not good at all it's not\ngood for people that that you employ\nnow it might be good for an employer\nit might be good for a workers comp\nattorney\nbut it is not good for the employee\nit is not good for a worker\nyou know in gwinnett county i'll never\nforget i was keeping the data two weeks\nago we were number five we were number\nfive with counties today we're number\none and we ain't looking back we're not\nlooking back\nwe're already we're already a thousand\nmore than fulton county in that count in\nthis county fulton county the county of\njulian we've got to realize we've got to\nsay to people that we we talk to each\nand every day that we care about them we\nalways talk about we came here to\nrepresent those that that that are\nvoiceless\nwell i'm saying to you that the people\nthat we need to thought to protect are\nthe people that are working because they\ndidn't close\nthe warehouse workers didn't close\nthe you went and shopped and ate every\nday you didn't close\nyour postal worker you didn't close\nso what i'm saying to you all is is that\nwe've got to we've got to make a\ndecision\nor are we going to think about saying\nthat\nthat we're going to reopen\nit's not a such thing as a reopen\nit's we have to improve but first\nthere are three things i think we must\ndo\nwe we must find a vaccine\nwe must find a cure\nwe must find treatment\ni still have no idea no one is\nmentioning me what we did with those\n1900 people\nno one has said that you know\ndo we send them home and quarantine them\nfor for 14 days do we tell them to go\nhome and drink three gallons of water\nor do we go home and tell them to\nto take our aspirin\ni have no idea what we do with the\nworkers these folks that are being\ntested new cases each and every day what\nkind of treatment they're having i have\nno idea what are we doing for contact\nyou know tracing i have no idea either\nbut all i know is is that we just can't\nkeep kicking this can down the road and\n359 will not do anything\nfor workers\nnot anything for the people you're\nsupposed to be caring about\ni uh\ni think i i shared the one story with\nyou all about\nthe the worker but i i've attended five\nfunerals\nfive funerals cover 19.\nand the worst one that i attended was a\nfriend of mine a former pro football\nplayer\nand at that time it was early\nand the only thing it was ten people you\nthey're only allowed ten\n10\n10 in the service 10.\ni'm one of the 10.\nthe pastor's one of the 10. so therefore\nnow you at eight\nand you're in a 300 you're in a 300 seat\nfacility and the wife is sitting on the\nfront row here the sister is sitting two\nrows back and i am in there with it with\na mask on and gloves which was mandatory\nwhich i kind of like\nat least you can take your mask off when\nyou come here to speak and you can hear\na little bit better but have you ever\nlooked out at 10 people in a 300\nthinking a 300c capacity and all you see\nis a mask and gloves\nand you trying to say something\nabout about their loved one\npeople we've got to do we are better\nthan that we are better than that\nand i'm asking my colleague one more\ntime\ni'm going to ask you i mean i'm asking\nyou passionately we need to vote no on\n359. we need to send a message that\nsure we're the number one place to do\nbusiness but we're also the number one\nplace for people to work and take care\nof their families\nwith that mr speaker i leave the well\nchair recognizes representative al\nwilliams to speak to the bill\nbefore i knew that was a lot of talking\nnow\nthank you mr speaker\ni've heard my colleague ultimately speak\nabout the workers\nand and he was certainly on time but i'm\nnot here i'm from another direction\nwhile i've always supported workers\n45 years of my working career has been\neither owning a business or working in\nbusiness consulting that's all i've ever\nworked with so i love business i have a\nproblem with business\nand\ni love being in place for seven straight\nyears has been the best place to do\nbusiness but i want us to go seven\nstraight years\nas the best place to live and raise a\nfamily too\nwhat i'm concerned about more so than\nanything is kind of under the radar and\ni ask this in rules and i was answered\nwhat about\nthe people in nursing homes\nwho won't have a legal recourse\nbecause of this legislation\nthere was a time in the conversation\nchanged in this country\nwhen when especially democrats\nand a lot of times republicans\ntalked about poor people\nonly people get talked about now are\nworking people in the middle class\na lot of poor people are in nursing\nhomes\npoor people\nand and and we've we've looked like\nwe've forgotten them\ndisproportionately they have died doing\nthis pandemic\ni understand many people have died but\nthe problem with this legislation is\nwhat about those that suffered before\nthe pandemic when nursing homes are\nwritten up time and time and time again\nfor post service\nfor terrible service\nnot talking about since the pandemic\nalone\nyou can go down the list and look at\nnursing homes written up time and time\nagain people who can't speak for\nthemselves and can't do anything laying\nup there at the mercy of corporations\nwho can afford lobbyists and they're\njust sitting there usually on medicaid\nand dying like flies doing this pandemic\ni have two and one in my district one\nright outside of my district the one\nright outside of my district is an\nexcellent facility one in my district is\nnot so excellent\nclosed down an entire wing because mole\nwas falling through the ceiling\nwater on the floor having to come in and\nvacuum up water time and time again\nthese folk couldn't speak for themselves\none thing about nursing homes\nthe first year\nall the birthdays all the special days\nchristmas visitors\nsecond year\nmr birthdays just come for christmas and\nspecial days third year\nhardly nothing after that and people\nstay in these facilities sometimes eight\nand ten and twelve years nobody comes to\nsee about them and only people can talk\nfor them are those of us\nthat have the opportunity to speak for\nthem\nyou're telling me that it's good\nbusiness to let people die because you\ndidn't keep your facility up now you\ncan't even sue them for it\nall these years of decrepitness\nterrible facilities\nsubstandard food don't even cut the\ngrass and they get paid the same thing\nby everybody\nand the only people losing are families\nwithout a voice and people who don't\neven have families\noh yes i love to do business and i'm\nglad we're doing business but what about\nthe least of ours\nwe're gonna be judged by what we did for\nthose who can't speak for themselves\nno it's not the legislation protects\nthose who don't deserve protection\nbecause they were lousy at business\nbefore the pandemic and they will be\nlousy afterwards we pass this kind of\nlegislation with that mr speaker i leave\nthe well\nchair recognizes the minority leader of\nthe house leader trammell to speak to\nthe bill\nthank you mr speaker and the gentleman\nfrom the 100th district and the\ngentleman from liberty county\nhave articulated\nvery\nwell developed critiques of this bill\nand i'm going to be very brief\nbut i just want to call your attention\nto line 10 of the bill\nthe findings of the general assembly in\nline specifically it is for health care\ninstitutions facilities and workers\nthat require additional flexibility and\nthen lines 13 through 15 of the bill\nthe finding that certain protections\nthat were provided during the gov\nin the governor's executive orders\nshould continue\nbeyond the public health state of\nemergency\nand that's for health care institutions\nfacilities and workers\nbut you know this bill has an\ninteresting name in section two\nthe georgia coveted 19 pandemic business\nsafety act\nlet me tell you something\nbusinesses don't get coveted\npeople get coveted\nthis bill doesn't seek to protect people\nfrom coveted\nit seeks to protect businesses against\npeople\nif we want to talk about safety\nwhat we should be talking about is ways\nto make workers\nsafe\nways to make georgians safe\nthat's the missing piece of this bill\nwe're not talking about providing\nprotective equipment\nin the bill\nfor people front line workers who had to\ngo in\nwhen i had the luxury to be able to sit\nin my house and shelter in place\nother frontline workers had to go to\nwork\nthis bill does nothing\nfor them\nand so we spent the resume legislative\nsession\nand this is what we decide\nis\nwhat we need to do about covid\nyou know if i had to say one thing about\nthis bill\nit would be\nthat it surely demonstrates the\nseriousness\nof covet 19.\nif we're in a position that we think we\nneed to provide immunity\nbecause covet 19 is such a terrible\nevent\nthen you know what else we need to be\ndoing as a body\nwe need to be legislating about public\nhealth measures that would keep people\nsafe\nand we're not doing it\nso mr speaker i'm going to oppose this\nbill\nbecause we should be talking about\nkeeping georgians safe\nbusinesses will be fine\nand the final point\nwhen we talk about a resumed economy\nyou know the economy is not going to get\nbetter because we provide immunity\nprotections for business\nthe economy is going to get better\nwhen people feel safe\nwhen they feel like they can go to work\nand interact again without risk of\ncontracting coven\nand that's not going to happen\njust because we provide immunity that\ndoesn't change the situation whatsoever\nmr speaker i'll yield for questions if\nthere are any if not i'll yield well\ndo you yield for questions i do\nchair recognizes representative bruce to\nyour right for a question\nthank you\ni yield\nis it\ntrue to say that\npassage of this bill\nand given the rights that we're talking\nabout to these companies in effect takes\nthat right away from\ngeneral citizens and people who are\napt to be heard by all this\nis that safe to say\ni think that's a that's a fair\ncharacterization\nand you know the\ni think that's a fair characterization\nokay\none more time i will\nwould this not be\nbetter handled by just people that home\nbusiness is taking out an insurance\npolicy\nto cover whatever\ndamages they have\ni think insurance is certainly an option\nthey look the truth is that\nyou know the the the type of\nthere's a there's a cynical\ncore at this bill\nand the cynical core is you know we\ndon't we don't\nimmunize provide immunity to businesses\nfor the flu\nor other diseases\nyou know the reality is there are this\nthis could have been narrowly tailored\nthe way the findings suggest to provide\nuh protection for healthcare\ninstitutions who were in the front lines\nand treating patients who were coming in\nbut instead this is an effort to to glom\non it's like a a free-for-all for\nimmunity you mentioned the word immunity\nand everybody wants in on it\none last thing about you\nare you\nby giving\nthis to the businesses who are we not in\nfact incenting them to be lackadaisical\nas they go forward with this you know if\nyou have no consequence for the actions\nyou take\nhow conscientious are you going to be\nabout those actions if there's no\nconsequence to them\nwell i think i think the gentleman has a\npoint i wouldn't say necessarily that\nthey're incentivized to do that but i\nthink there is a risk of a moral hazard\nand that moral hazard is\nthat if you have immunity and it doesn't\nmatter\nwhat you're doing then you're less\nlikely to take the types of steps that\nwould keep people as safe\nand the final thing i would say uh\nbefore i yield the well mr speaker is\nyou know when i was at home in the\nmiddle of this covet crisis i didn't get\nany emails\nfrom local businesses saying hey the\nmost pressing thing that we need to do\nto combat covid\nis to provide immunity for businesses\nbut you know what i got a lot of emails\nfrom workers who were concerned about\nthe lack of safety protection in their\nplaces of employment and they were\nasking what could they do\nand the sad answer that i had to give\nback to them is\nnot much\nyou can call dph if they're not\nfollowing the the guidelines in the\nexecutive orders but with this\nthe answer will be tell them you're out\nof luck mr speaker i yield the well\ngentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered\nthe chair here's none the previous\nquestion is ordered is there any\nobjection to

feel\nmelody debussy and her team at the\nsenate budget and evaluation office have\ndone an incredible job as well\nour folks the ones i'm so proud of the\nhouse budget research office have been\nincredible\nmartha and christine and all the team\nacross the street over there\nhave spent hours and hours and hours\nliterally\npouring over information trying to\nunderstand how federal funds were being\nused or could be used and how they can\nbe used in different areas\nthey have truly done an outstanding job\nkelly fahr and his team at opb\nthey have done an incredible job as well\nwe have truly had a partnership as we\nhave gone through these last three\nmonths trying to figure out\nwhere the ship of state would land\nas we came back into session to adopt a\nbudget\nmy administrative assistant ashley\nnewton down in\n245\nshe has answered thousands of phone\ncalls as most of your admins have as\nwell\nfrom unemployment issues to anything\nunder the sun that you can imagine\nbut i need to say a special thank you\nsomeone tonight that i haven't had a\nwhole lot of time with for the last many\nweeks my wife cindy\nwhen i've been there i haven't really\nbeen there\nbecause we've been on zoom calls we've\nbeen on emails we've been on conference\ncalls the first one thing in another\nand i've been just a little more than\ndistracted while i've been home so thank\nyou to her\nso as we were here in september\nwe were having discussions about the\ngovernor's idea\nto reduce the state's budget by six\npercent\nwe came back in with that plan in mind\nas we left here and adopted a budget on\non march the 10th and then as we left\nhere on the 13th to come back on the\n16th for a day\nwe felt good about the budget we had\npassed we've given our hard-working\nstate employees and our school teachers\na very well deserved raise\nthen covet 19 hit\nsomething like none of us living today\nwith exception of maybe chairman don\nhogan who was here during the 1918\nspanish flu\nnothing like this have we ever seen in\nour lifetimes\nwe we lived through the great recession\nwe saw what it did to our state's\neconomy to our nation's economy to the\nworld's economy\nbut it was spread over a period of three\nor four or five years\nwhat we've seen happen to us now\nhappened in one quarter\ni hope it is a v\ninstead of a u\nor trough\nand i have much optimism to think that\nit's going to be a v georgia continues\nto outperform the nation\nin our retail sales and credit card\ntransactions\nmatter of fact we are doing about twice\nas well as the rest of the nation\nbut we're still\nshort\nit's still required that our governor\ndo the prudent thing in coming back and\nlowering the revenue estimate\nfrom what he had originally established\nwhen we were here in march\nit was necessary it was prudent\nthankfully through the time\nof the last seven or eight or nine years\nof recovery from the great recession\nwe have had the ability to restore and\nbuild upon our rainy day fund here in\nthe state of georgia\nwe've done so to the point of about 2.8\nbillion dollars\nas the breaks were applied in march\napril and may\ni for one was very thankful\nthat we were able to do that\nsome things i want to tell you about in\nthis budget\nwhile it's a 10 percent reduction\nbasically across the entire budget\nmany agencies are not reduced to the\nlevel of 10 percent\nsome agencies were able to help a little\nmore than others so you'll see some that\nare a little over 10 percent\nbut as a whole throughout the budget\nit's basically a ten percent reduction\nit was necessary when two billion\ndollars\nor almost two and a half billion dollars\ndisappear\nout of the revenue stream almost\novernight\nwithin the budget and the revenue\nestimate that the governor gave us as a\nrevised revenue estimate on monday\nhe is recognizing funds from the rsr of\nabout 250 million dollars\nwhy not more you may ask\nwell\nstatute requires that four percent of\nprior year revenues remain in the rainy\nday fund\nin the rsr\nit also requires that one percent be set\naside as well\nfor the mid-term k-12 adjustment\nso that's five percent of prior year\nrevenues that have to be left in the rsr\nand cannot be touched cannot be\nappropriated\nthey can be touched under the trigger\nthat revenue once we get into the new\nfiscal year\nthey can be touched at that point to\npull those funds down if the governor\ndeems it necessary\nunderstand that to finish out fy20\nit will take us somewhere over 1 billion\ndollars out of the rsr to close out the\nbooks\nthat's why we're only moving 250 million\nat this time\ni want to thank our members of the\nappropriations committee\nboth republican and democrat\nwe've heard from many of you\nwe've taken many suggestions we've taken\nmany\npoints\nor concerns that you have had as we've\ngone through this process\nand i want to tell you that the budget\nyou have on the on your desk in front of\nyou today is much different than the\nbest the budget that left the desk of\nthe senate last friday\nwith the governor lowering the projected\ncut from eleven percent to two to ten\npercent\nit has made some significant changes\nwithin this document\nfirst off\ni know many of you had concerns about\npre-k and hope\npre-k and hope remain left alone\nthankfully our lottery sales have\nremained incredibly strong\nand we still have the only lottery in\nthe united states of america that has\ncontinued to grow during its entire\nlifetime\neducation still receives\n53.2 percent of the total state funds\nthat are allocated in this budget\nwhile there is a reduction in qbe\nof 10\nor about 950 million dollars one thing i\nwant you to understand and note\nthat there were also\n457 million dollars in federal funds\nthat were distributed by the georgia\ndepartment of education to our school\nsystems in the state\nto help offset some of the reductions\nthat they i'm assuming they knew that we\nwere going to have to make and they were\ndistributed on the title one formula\nso when you look at it that way\nit winds up being about a four to four\nand a half percent cut\nto the funds going to education\nbecause those school systems can use\nthose federal funds to replace\nrevenue also hear me and when i say that\nk-12 enrollment growth is fully funded\ntraining and experience the steps for\nour teachers are fully funded in this\nbudget equalization that is vitally\nimportant to our rural school systems is\nfully funded in this budget\nsparsity grants are fully funded in this\nbudget\nthe senate as they were having to work\ntoward an 11 percent\nfound it necessary and i don't disagree\nwith them because they were trying to\nfind dollars anywhere they could find\nthem\nthey had made a reduction in student or\npupil transportation we have been able\nto fully restore that transportation\nfund back to where it was\nin previous years\ngovernor's office of student achievement\nmany of you have\nexpressed your concern about the\ngovernor's honors program and several\nother things that were being done there\nat ghosa\nwe have basically sort of restructured\nit\nmany years now we've been putting\ndifferent things at gosa and taking a\nfew things away and putting things back\nand first one thing in another\nbut we have reallocated funds within\ngosa 1.7 million for the master teacher\nleadership academy 1.6 million for\ngovernor's honors 1.5 million for\ngrowing readers and 1.8 million for the\ngeorgia awards program\nthose are there and funded\nhigher education both our university\nsystem and the technical college system\nof georgia\nthey do see cuts as well\nbut understand they also receive\nsignificant federal funding\nto offset what they knew would be some\ndifficulties that they would be facing\nbut understand as well\ntheir methods of teaching may very well\nbe different come this fall\nmoving toward a virtual model\nas well as k-12 systems may have to do\nas well\ni want to mention one other thing on the\nk-12 systems before i move on\nas we came through the great recession\nand we made necessary cuts back at that\ntime\nour school superintendents our school\nboards our administrators within the\nschool systems\nrealized at that point that they were\ncaught short\nin many ways and knew that they could do\nbetter\nwhen funding revenue from the state or\nfrom the federal government took a dip\nthey know we have to live under a\nbalanced budget just as they do\nour school systems have done an\noutstanding job\nin the intervening eight or nine years\nin building local reserves\nour local systems are setting on about\n3.3 billion dollars in reserves on the\nlocal level more than the state of\ngeorgia itself has in the bank right now\ni'm not complaining i'm bragging on them\ni'm proud of them for the job they have\ndone to prepare\nfor the next dip in the\neconomy the department of labor i know\ni've i've had\ntons of conversations with many of you\nas it relates to the department of labor\nand trying to to get the onslaught of\npeople that they've been trying to help\nand trying to to to give assistance to\nfor the last two weeks i've been staying\ndowntown in a hotel that's directly\nacross the street from the department of\nlabor building i want to brag on those\nfolks for just a second\ni'm an early\nriser and as i've been getting up in the\nmornings and getting dressed i've been\nlooking out the window\nand what startled me last monday morning\na week ago was to see\ndepartment of labor employees\nleaving the parking lot walking to the\nbuilding at 5 45 in the morning\nwe would finish here late i would get\nback to the hotel 8 39 o'clock sometimes\na little bit later to look across in\nthat building still see office lights on\nand people in there working\nthose folks have done an outstanding job\none that we know very well many of us\nknow very well that i talked to on a\nfairly regular basis\ni was talking to her the other day about\na certain claim and she shared with me\nthat she had 24\n300 emails in her inbox\nof folks she was trying to help\nkeeping that in mind there are no\nreductions to the department of labor\nthe conferees also felt that because of\nthe pandemic it was necessary and\nprudent\nto help the department of public health\nas well the county grant and aid money\nhas been put back into the budget\nthat goes directly to our counties and\nthe county health departments\nin this budget as well\nfunds six months of postpartum care for\nmothers on medicaid\n19.7 million dollars\nthere is also eight million dollars in\nnew investments for behavioral health\ncore services that increase the capacity\nacross this state for those individuals\nneeding help\n2.5 million dollars in new funds are\ndirected to open 95 crisis beds in the\nstate as well\nwe know that dbhd is going to face an\nissue\nas we come out of this pandemic\nand we felt that it was necessary to\nmake sure that they were equipped to\nhandle that\nalso there's enough money in there today\nnow to go back to the house position of\n100 now and comp waivers\nfor those with disabilities across this\nstate\naddiction services another thing that\ndbhd has to deal with\nwe've heard from many of you talking\nabout the addiction recovery centers and\nthe and and stressing a little bit about\nthose potentially having to close\nthe 3.6 million dollar proposed\nreduction there\nhas been wiped out and they have been\nrestored\nmany many things within this budget to\nbe proud of many many things in this\nbudget to vote yes on\nas the governor gave us his revised\nrevenue estimate he included in it\nsomething that he felt was necessary and\nwe certainly agreed to\nand that was 15 million additional\ndollars to the criminal justice\ncoordinating council\nto help further law enforcement training\nin understanding how to de-escalate\nevents\nif you'll remember in fy 17 we also\nstarted a program at gypstic the georgia\npublic safety training center down at\nforsyth georgia\n2.1 million dollars since then has been\nspent\nto add a class on de-escalation\nand those since 2017 on have received\nthat as their base schooling\nand as those post-certified officers go\nback for additional training they also\nget that schooling as well\ncriminal justice also requires\na sound and timely processing of\nevidence\nso as you look at gbi\nyou'll see\nthat those individuals that we need to\nprocess rape kits and other evidence\nthat funding has been restored as well\nthe proposed original reductions to the\naccountability courts\nhave been restored\nto funding as well too\nyou know personal services is\ngovernment's largest\nexpense when faced with reductions of\nhistorical magnitude the budget options\nhad to contemplate reductions in force\nand in furloughs\nhowever house bill 793\nhear me well\nhouse bill 793\ndoes not contemplate any furloughs\nlet me say it again\nhouse bill 793 does not contemplate any\nfurloughs\nmany were proposed\nand truly honestly the difference of one\npercent from 11 to 10 percent we were\nable to eliminate\nany and all furloughs within this budget\nwe've consistently asked our state\nworkforce to do more\nwith less\nespecially\nduring the great recession and the time\nafter it and technology has certainly\nhelped and i think we're going to see a\nlot of changes in state government and\nbusiness in general\nbecause we figured out teleworking works\npretty well\nin talking with director tom rawlings\nbig facts\nhe has been amazed\nthat the case work that their folks have\nbeen able to do that normally came into\nan office from eight to five every day\nhas actually increased as they have been\nworking from home\nbecause less distractions more more time\nto focus on what they're doing\nto our state employees who were stressed\nabout the\nthe potential\ntripped on that one the potential for\nfurloughs\nwe're sorry that you had to go through\nthat stress we understand that\nany of us that have worked for an\nemployer understand when downsizing or\nfurloughs or whatever are are being\ntalked about is very stressful\nbut we're very thankful\nfor the job that you do on a daily basis\nfrom our law enforcement individuals\nto our admins here to the folks at\ndepartment of labor dot department of ag\nwherever corrections juvenile justice\ni've started down a list i'm afraid\nsomebody will get mad because i stopped\nbut our time is limited\nbut thank you to those individuals\nthat keep us safe\nkeep us healthy\nand keep us educated\nladies and gentlemen i typically walk\nthrough the tracking sheet\ni brought a case of water just in case\nyou want to\nbut there are\n2035 lines that show up as differences\nwithin the house version of this budget\ni don't figure you want to stay here and\nlisten to me talk that long\nmr speaker\ni'm glad to answer a few questions\nthis budget has been on everyone's desk\nfor a little over 24 hours now\ni think we've had time to look at it i\nthink we i know we've had time to ask\nquestions because our office has been\nfielding questions i saw melody with the\nwith the senate budget office a few\nminutes ago she said she had been\nanswering some of your questions from\nhouse members\ni hope we have answered your questions i\nhope you understand what you have in\nfront of you\nit's tough to cut 10 percent\nthere's nothing easy about cutting 10\npercent out of a budget\nbut i truly believe that what you have\non your desk in front of you is\nsomething that you can go home and be\nproud of and i see\nsenator lucas\nand i want to mention one last thing\nbefore i take questions\nsenator lucas and i have chaired or\nco-chaired the the\ngovernor's rural hospital stabilization\ncommission for quite a few years now\nit's kind of our passion something we\nshare and have a lot in common and is\nour joint passion there\nand one of the things that i'm very\nproud of in this budget as well is we\nwere able to go in and put some\nadditional funding in to help our rural\nhospitals\nwe know that putting the brakes on\nelective surgeries impacted our rural\nhospitals dramatically\nright now they're in pretty good shape\nbecause they don't do the collections\nfor those billings until another month\nor so\nwe know that there will be a crisis at\nthat point\nand i feel like that we're set in a way\nto help those hospitals at that point in\ntime\nmr speaker i'll answer a question or two\nand then i'll get out of the way because\ni know about the next thing is maybe the\ngovernor and us going home\nchair recognizes uh chairman beverly to\nyour left for a question\nthis habit\nthose gentlemen you yes sir\nuh is it not true that i have a\ntremendous amount of respect for you i\nthink that you are a fantastic\nlegislator i said this is not true that\ni have a tremendous amount of respect\nfor you that you are a fantastic\nlegislator thank you great great\nchairman and that your staff is above\napproach\nuh is it further not true and here's the\nheart of the question that this budget\ndoes not contemplate\ncutting corporate loopholes around that\ncould generate\napproximately 500 million dollars\nwhere we wouldn't have to\nuh actually cut anything\nthat we could leverage\nit's not true\nthat this budget does not contemplate\nthe question is is true that this budget\ndid not\nconfidently cut in corporate\ntax credits across the board\nwell thank you for that question and and\nno it does not and here's why\neven if we did a rollback on those today\nthe impact would still be next year\nwould still be at the earliest six\nmonths whether it be\nlooking at at tax credits that we use\nand have used to make georgia the number\none state in the country to do business\nin\nand take it another step further looking\nat tobacco funds i know there's been a\nlot of a lot of discussion about tobacco\ntaxes here\neven if that had been contemplated in it\nwe would not be able or even if that had\npassed we would not be able to recognize\nit until at least january of next year\nunderstand we have a a guard rail\nto work within and that guard rail to\nwork within is what the governor says is\nthe revenue estimate\nhad he included that\nin there\nand that bill stalled or failed or\nstopped or whatever and didn't make it\nacross the finish line to make it to his\ndesk and he had included five 200\nmillion is the number i've seen on\ntobacco had he included that in his\nrevenue estimate\nand we got back here in january it would\nmake our job in the amended budget much\nmuch worse because what happens at that\npoint\nif you've come up short because some of\nthose things didn't pass\nthen at that point contracts have been\nissued for k-12 school systems they've\nbeen issued at regents and\ntechnical college system for instruction\nyou've taken effectively 53.2 percent of\nthe budget off the table to be able to\nwork within to be able to balance the\nrest of the budget\nleaving roughly 46 47 of the remainder\nwhich are dbhdd dph dch djjdoc\npublic safety all those different\nentities\nthat then\nif we had looked at say a five percent\ncut instead of a ten percent cut today\ncoming back then and knowing that those\nthings those measures didn't pass that\nmoney was gone it was never there to\nbegin with\nthen\nthose reductions to those other agencies\ni just mentioned\nwould probably be somewhere between ten\nor twelve percent above the five percent\nthat we would have theoretically based\nit on\nso i would tell you\nyou know that's a that's a whole other\ndiscussion outside of the budget but i\nwould tell you that\nthe revenue estimate we have in front of\nus is a prudent revenue estimate in the\nway that it was calculated and what were\nthe things that were anticipated in it\nshould some of some of that had moved\nthen we would have been in a better\nshape come january potentially\nbut again i've seen wildly varying\nnumbers just on the tobacco tax number\nitself i've heard anything from 50 to\n500 million so you never know\ni hope that answers your question\ngenerally for one other question yes sir\nwas there any consideration around doing\na revenue anticipatory note or attack\ninto supporting pretoria note to cover\nthe shortfall because we're in a\npandemic\nthat we could easily leverage debt in\nthis particular space to cover the cost\nof the cuts\nand then come back with a date certain\nthat are repayable so if we did a\nrevenue anticipatory note that the date\ncertainly a year from now we could\ninvariably have the revenue to\nthe only way that the state government\ncan do that\nis that it has to be taken and repaid\nwithin the same fiscal year\nand to make what i think you're thinking\nabout work you would not be able to do\nit within the same fiscal year\nbecause if revenues never rebounded we\nwould not have that ability to repay it\nand we would be in a we would sure\nenough be in a bad spot at that point\nyes sir mr speaker i'll take one more\nquestion i think everybody has a very\ngood idea of how they're going to vote\nand i i don't want to cut folks short\nbut at the same time we've had\na little over 24 hours to talk about it\nand i certainly hope that we've been\nable to answer as many questions as\npossible in that time so one more\nquestion\nwell you have six lined up but if you're\nonly going to take one more i'd\nrecognize one member of\nrepresenting one member of the\ndemocratic caucus\nwe'll go to the republican caucus and\nrecognize\nchairman hawkins to your right for a\nquestion\ndoes the general on yield yes sir\ni've said to you over many years thank\nyou for what you do privately i want to\nsay it publicly tonight\nyou've built two budgets this year\nand god knows what we may face in the\nfuture\nthis is covent 19 we may have a cold\ndude 20 and 21\nand i want to tell you i feel very\ncomfortable having a man like you\nhelping us do this thank you sir thank\nyou thank you mr speaker since that was\nan undeserved compliment\ni'll take a couple more questions\nif he had said it about staff if he said\nit about our staff then it would have\nbeen deserved but he said it about me so\nit wasn't deserved\nchair recognizes uh representative\noliver to your left for a question\ndoes the gentleman kneel yes ma'am i\nalso want to thank you for your work and\nparticularly for you indulging me time\nand time again on many issues\nbut is it true sir that the frustration\nof having to do a\nbillion dollar cut\nmakes us reflect on how things are just\nnot changing quickly enough\nand i direct your attention\nto the bond package from one page 167 to\n169\nwhere we're purchasing for five million\ndollars of bonds\nfor 500 new cars\nyou agree with me i think that our work\npatterns are changing\nyou agree with me that the rental units\nover at the twin towers has helped\nwhy is it that we continue to buy cars\nfour and 500 cars a year in a budget\ncrisis\nwell i think because just like myself\nthings wear out\nvehicles certainly wear out and what we\nhave what we what you and i have\ninherited and all of us have inherited\nis a fairly large fleet that we have\nmanaged to trim over the last 10 years\nfairly significantly but it's still a\npretty large fleet\neven with the work patterns changing\nthere is still the need for many of our\npeople whether it be in juvenile justice\ncommunity supervision corrections\npardons and paroles department of ag\ndepartment of labor i can go on\nbut there's still a need for them to be\nin person from place to place\nand\nin talking with commissioner black i'll\nuse as an example\nthe fleet he inherited several years ago\nthey were spending more on repair and\nreplacement of parts on those vehicles\nthan what the vehicle was actually worth\nbut they didn't have replacements for\nthem\nso i share your concern you and i have\ntalked\ni would say ad nauseam but i don't get\nsick from it but it's been a lot\nabout this particular issue\nand\nwe've still got some work to do i i will\ntell you that i feel like we've still\ngot some work to do but i do know that i\ndon't want\none of our state employees stranded on\nthe side of the road because they're\nstill having to drive a vehicle with 175\nor 180 000 miles on it that breaks down\nand strands them there but we will get\nthere thank you mr speaker one more\nquestion i mean it this time chair\nrecognizes representative gertler\nin the gallery to your left for a\nquestion\nthe gentleman yielded yes sir\nis it not true\nthat we've asked these departments like\nour law enforcement\nour education department to make cuts\nyet conveniently we have still fully\nfunded the one georgia authority\nwhich is not the proper role of\ngovernment to interfere in free markets\nis it not true that that's really a slap\nin the face\nto the taxpayers and the economy in\ngeorgia\nwhen we have a budget crisis\nwe're funding\nsubsidies that are not conservative\nnot the proper role government\nis that not true you and i have had\nseveral discussions on this particular\npoint over your term here and i would\ncontinue to say\nthat the job of the one georgia\nauthority\nriva grants other things are things that\nbring jobs to the state of georgia if\nyou wish not to bring jobs\nto this\nstate then\nif you're ever in my shoes you can do\nwhat you wish to but i happen to be a\nvery strong believer\nin the work that one georgia does for\nour economy\nfor our rural areas around the state\nand those that are probably going to be\nhurt are hit the worst\nof any communities in the state are the\nrural parts of this state during this\npandemic\nand i think
