Walker\nof the 20th offered the following\namendment to a to House Bill 557\nby amending line 14 to read as follows\n43-1-36.1\nthat completes the order Mr President\nwithout objection I recognized senator\nfrom the 20th speak to the measure\nthank you Mr President\nwe've heard two recurring themes this\nsession\nWorkforce and Health Care access\nand House Bill 557 attempts to address\nthe issues we're having in both of those\nareas\nI've said from this well before that\nevery business owner every industry I\ntalked to in my district complains of\nWorkforce shortages I'm sure you're here\nyou've heard that from your constituents\nalso\npart of the uh one of the areas where\nthe workforce shortages are are the most\nacute is in the health care Arena\nthe governor appointed a health care\nWorkforce Commission\nbecause of the concern of this and to\ntry to make recommendations to address\nthe issue\nand his one of the recommend or the\nrecommendation\nfor healthcare Workforce are focused on\nstrategies that maximize our existing\nWorkforce optimize our education system\nand attract new workers\nI've I've brought a bill in the past\nbefore to\ngive a limited expansion of ability for\nadvanced practice registered nurses to\nadminister scheduled two narcotics\nand I'm bringing it to you again today\nthis bill is a compromise it includes\nphysician assistance and aprns and it\ndoes does several things first of all\nwanted to let you know that\naprns on the AP audience Georgia and\nOklahoma\nare the only states that prohibit aprms\nfrom any sort of schedule 2 prescribing\nhowever Oklahoma does allow crnas to\nadminister schedule twos\nand for PA physician assistants George\nand Kentucky are the only states with a\nblanket prohibition\nand many of our counties there is only a\nphysician Assistance or APRN present in\nthe medical facility in that county\nof course they're working under the\ndirection of a of an MD\nbut they're oftentimes the only person\nthere\nso what this bill does\nunder certain conditions\nit allows aprns and\nphysician assistants provide adult\npatients patients over 18 or over\nwith a five day a limited five-day\ncourse\nof certain schedule 2 medications which\nare spelled out on the bill and it's\nhydrocodone\nand oxycodone or a compound of those\nand it has to be in an emergency\nsituation\nfive days it's got to be an emergency\nsituation\nonly to an adult and it has to be part\nof their\nprotocol agreement with the physician\nthat they work under\nit also expedites the post-initial\nlicensure procedure for aprns and PAs at\nthe composite Medical Board\nso aprns and are licensed by the nursing\nboard\nbut their protocol agreement with the\nphysician they work with has to be\napproved by the composite Medical Board\nonce they're initially licensed in their\ninitial protocol agreement is approved\nthis bill would call for any any changes\nlike let's say that physician retires\nand they go to work under another\nphysician\nas long as the the protocol agreement is\nreasonably similar\nwhen they send in their application to\nwork with a new physician it would be\ndeemed approved\nand it's the same same streamline for\nthe physician assist assistance\nand then the third thing that the the\nbill does is it allows aprns and\nphysician assistance to\nprovide a\nparking permit for people with\ndisabilities\nuh now we have\nso that's kind of the original part of\nhouse bill 557.\nyou'll see on your desk\nnow three amendments\nI agree with Amendment one it's a\nfriendly Amendment but I think I'll let\nthe senator the chair chairman of our\nfinance committee explain\nthis amendment that's that's his\nAmendment but I'm supportive of it\nAmendment two I was asked to consider\nadding language\nfrom a bill that didn't make it across\nand I'm agreeable with that and what\namendment two would do is you know we've\nof course been through a pandemic and\nwe've asked a lot of our medical\nproviders and they've been under a heavy\nheavy workload and a lot of stress\namendment 2 would provide or allow for\nthese medical providers to seek mental\nhealth counseling\nwithout jeopardizing their license\nso they they could be confidentially\nseek counseling for stress mental health\ndepression those kind of things\nthat's what amendment 2 does and then\nAmendment 2A thankfully my smart seat\nmate our esteemed Appropriations chair\nrealize that\nwe had a little I guess you'd call it a\nscrivener's era\nand that is correcting that's if if he\nhad not caught that basically Amendment\none and Amendment two would kind of\noffset each other and\nthat would be that's not what we were\ntrying to do so be happy to try to\nanswer any questions if there are any\nbut I'll also be happy to yield the well\nno questions awesome thank you all\nplease vote green\nall right\ngood job\nsir I recognize the senator from the\n52nd speaks Amendment one\nthank you Mr President I don't think\nI've offered an amendment for a couple\nof years so I rarely often a member but\nwhen I do\nit's for a reason\num there is a\nlet's say a hospital closed in\na city like Atlanta\nI know that doesn't happen too often but\nlet's say they closed they give 30 days\nnotice and we're going to shut down and\nanother hospital we're going to close\ndown\nand then they say\nto the employees there\nthat we they have under contract well\nwe've got to know compete with you\nso you can't go to work for Piedmont or\nGrady or Emory or north side\nbecause we've got a nonca people wait a\nminute my place is completely closed\nwell we got places in other parts of the\nstate but you can't live where you live\nand go to work at these places even\nthough we're shutting the place down\num I also learned that there's no\nnon-competes for lawyers in the state of\nGeorgia because I guess they write the\nlaws so that they have that taken care\nof so I've\nI want an amendment to address that type\nof situation there's other situations\nwhere somebody comes in and buys a group\nout and says\nwe're cutting your pay in half\nwell I don't want to work there anymore\nthen I'm going to go work somewhere else\noh no you've got a non-compete\nyou have to stay here\nthere are situations where oh but they\nwould let you take care of the\nnon-compete for four million dollars and\nyou'd get out of it that way\nsituation where somebody comes in and\nsays\nwe've uh we're going to cut your pay but\nalso\nwe've got facilities in Georgia outside\nof Georgia and we reserve the right to\nmove you\nto one of those other facilities\nat whatever pay we determine\nI mean that doesn't even sound like\nAmerica to me\nso I don't know how we got in this\nsituation\nhad a conversation with Piedmont\nHospital\nlast week and never worked for Piedmont\nHospital but I guess they got a lot of\nrespect for them because they told me\nwe don't have a single non-compete\nwe don't believe in non-competes We\nBelieve\nif we take care of our doctors and\nnurses they'll want to stay with us and\nso we're opposed to non-competes\nnow I'm not trying to eliminate all\nnon-competes I think we maybe should but\nin this particular Bill I'm saying you\nclose a place down\nyou can't hold them to working there\nyou come in and take over and you change\ntheir pay\nsignificantly and you can't say\nyou know no you can't go to work\nanywhere else We've Got You Under This\nslavery it sounds like to me\nso that's what these amendments do they\naddress some things that really are\nquite shocking to me of what happened\nout of this\nthere's no questions our Guild will\nyou got no questions\nrecognize the senator from the 49th\nwhat purpose you rise I ask for\nunanimous consent to excuse the senator\nfrom the 48 for business in Ziona\ncapital\nwithout objection center from the 48th\nis excuse\norganize the\nsenator from the 19th

measure chair here's none is\ntheir objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered chair is done previous\nquestion is ordered\nquestion is on adoption on Amendment one\nauthored by the senator from the 52nd\nis their objection\nwithout objection Amendment one is\nadopted\nquestion now is on the amendment number\ntwo to a excuse me\non amendment number on 2A is their\nobjection to Amendment

provide that the\nGeorgia access to medical cannabis\ncommission shall be subject to the\nadministrative procedure act and laws\ngoverning opening meetings and open\nrecords\nthe committee of the Senate on regulated\nIndustries and utilities recommends that\nthis bill do pass by committee\nsubstitute respectfully submitted\nSenator Council of the 46th district\nchairman\nregulated Industries and utilities\noffers the following substitute to House\nBill 196 a bill to be entitled an act to\namend chapter 2 of Title II of the\nofficial code of Georgia annotated\nrelating to the Department of\nAgriculture so as to provide for the\nstudy of the regulation of the\nproduction distribution and use of\nmedical cannabis that completes the\norder Mr President\nthat objection and recognized senator\nfrom the 46th speaks of the measure\nthank you Mr President Senators it's my\npleasure to be with you this afternoon\nto present the committee substitute to\nhouse bill 196.\nit seems to have become somewhat of an\nannual tradition here in the legislature\nas we review the medical marijuana laws\nthis is a journey that we started five\nor six years ago heck maybe longer than\nthat one of you may recall Allen Peak\nhad this legislation none of us had even\nheard of medical marijuana and we began\nto be educated and we passed bills to\nallow people to possess it then we\nrealized they couldn't couldn't get it\nhere from out of state so we ultimately\ncame up with the system\nthe medical cannabis commission that\nwould license producers to manufacture\nand produce and sell medical cabinets\ncannabis products for all the many\ndifferent ailments that have been\nidentified that can be helped by this\nyou know in many ways we have failed in\nthis endeavor because here we are I was\ntalking to the rules chairman this\nmorning it was four or six years ago\nwhen we first we can't even agree when\non on that simple fact when we started\nthis when we we passed the bill\nand it took years and years and years\nfor the commission to get organized to\nget its rules and regulations together\nto take applications to grade those and\nthen award licenses\nnot issue them but award them\nand in the meantime all of these\nchildren with seizures and all the\npeople with other conditions that\nthere's pretty strong evidence that\nmedical marijuana products can help have\nbeen sitting there waiting\nand all the time the frustration has\nboiled within this body and within our\ncitizenry as to when are we finally\ngoing to do something about this\nwell finally the the licenses were\nawarded\nand the next thing you knew there were\nmany disgruntled unhappy applicants for\nlicenses that were rejected\nthat filed legal challenges\nthe two class one licenses which are the\nlargest producers had their challenges\ndismissed and they have been in the\nprocess of manufacturing these low THC\noil products and CBD products and other\nmarijuana-based products\nto get them to the shelves\nthe four class four licenses that were\nawarded are still tied up in court from\nnine different uh protesters we'll call\nthem applicants that did not receive\nlicenses that have filed a variety of\nlawsuits\nsome of those claims are in the court of\nappeals as we speak and we expect an\nopinion will be issued later this spring\nprobably out of we're out of session and\nmaybe it resolves it you know maybe they\ndismiss those appeals and the four class\ntwo licensees are awarded their licenses\nand will help ramp up the production\nmaybe they'll they win those protests\nbecause they have a lot of\nvery strong arguments that they were\nunhappy with the process\nit was not transparent\ndidn't follow the open procedures open\nrecords acts of our state or the\nadministrative procedures Act\nwe're not totally forthcoming even when\nthe house regulated Industries committee\nasked to get to the bottom of it last\nyear was just told sorry that's\nconfidential we can't give you that\ninformation which just fed the paranoia\nof the licensed applicants that didn't\nget there their licenses at least tell\nthem why what was their score what were\nthey fairly scored how did they compare\nto the other applicants that were\nawarded licenses\nand it's been extraordinarily\nfrustrating in response the house passed\nthis bill\nthe bottom line of this bill it cleans\nup a lot of the procedures\nbut it attempted to Grant licenses to\nthe nine protesters\nso that we would go from having two\nclass ones and four class twos to a\ntotal of at least 16 licenses 15\nlicenses get my math straight on that\nSenate regulated Industries committee\nsympathize with the plight but feel like\nthat approach does nothing but reward\nthe protesters that spent the money to\nhire attorneys and litigate the issue\nand it ignored the valid complaints of\nthe other 60 some odd applicants that\nlost maybe justly maybe unjustly but\nthey didn't hire attorneys and appeal it\nso this does not Grant any new producer\nlicenses\nbut we're going to address the\nunderlying problems with the commission\nnot going in specific order in the bill\nbut what it will do is require the\ncommission\nto follow the administrative procedures\nact going forward\nit will require them to follow the open\nrecords laws like all other government\nagencies are required to do\nwith exceptions for the privacy laws\nthat in certain circumstances data and\ninformation would not be revealed\nwould not give new licenses at this time\nfor producers\nbut it would Grant new dispensary\nlicenses\nto the producers that have been awarded\nlicenses if they have a dispensary at\ntheir production facility they will be\nable to dispense the products\nand we'll also be able to dispense the\nproducts of the other licensees so you\nwouldn't have to just sell your product\nyou could sell all your different\ncompetitors products as well many of\nthese products are directed at specific\nmedical problems and so that makes sense\nto get access to our citizens\non the bright side I'm told by the\ncommission that by mid-april just a\ncouple of weeks from now these other\ndispensary licenses will be issued\nand we're told by the two class one\nlicense holders who are in the process\nof manufacturing the product that it\nwill be on the shelves by the first of\nJune or early June of this year so\nthere's relief insight for those\npatients that have been waiting\npatiently or impatiently for the last\nfour or five years to see product be\navailable to them\nwe have also taken into account the\nconcerns of some of the unsuccessful\napplicants and people that have pushed\nfor many years that maybe we need more\nlicenses the more the merrier you know\nthere's a balancing act of some type\nhere and I have always cautioned for\nrestraint let's make sure what we know\nwhat we're doing let's get it going and\nthen let's leave that open in the future\nif we need to increase the number of\nlicenses that we grant for production\nand manufacture of these products\nright now there are 26 000 Georgians\nthat are on the patient registry they\nare qualified to receive these\nmedications once they hit the shelves\nthere have been a lot of estimates that\nthat number will greatly increase over\nthe years as this becomes more available\nprescribed More Often by physicians and\nand found to be more helpful to people\nwith these conditions\na couple of years ago when we looked at\nthis issue the estimates were that that\nlist will probably go to 75 or 85 000\nPeople based on the population of\nGeorgia and based on the percentage of\npeople in other states that end up being\non their patient registries\nyou're not always comparing Apples to\nApples or oranges to oranges because of\ndifferent populations different laws\ndifferent conditions that are covered\nbut it would not be surprising for there\nto be several hundred thousand Georgians\non these patient registry list\nin the future\nso this bill builds in the potential for\nfuture licenses once our patient\nregistry hits 250 000 patients\nand then every 50 000 increase going\nforward from there there could be\nadditional licenses issued\nthe other thing that's been frustrated\nfor many of us is how this has gotten\nbogged down in court\nI'm a lawyer\nand I don't understand all the appeals I\nam not sure even I understand what the\nlegal arguments are on a lot of these\nlawsuits\nthey're complex they're complicated\nand they are filed in different courts\nand so we may have a situation with\ndifferent results based on your Venue\nWhere You Are\na brilliant part of this\nlegislation was to send all appeals in\nthe future to the Statewide business\nCourt\nwhich will be able to develop a\nspecialization in that area and give\nrapid accurate just outcomes to these\nappeals if there are any future appeals\nin the future\nour good friend former Senator Bill\nHamrick is now the chief judge in that\nStatewide business court so those those\nmatters will be in good hands going\nforward if they're further legal\ndisputes which unfortunately in this\nSociety\nthey're going to be legal disputes\nnow how are we going to keep this clean\nin the future and make it more efficient\nother than just the administrative\nprocedures act and open records\nwe have decided and this is in the very\nfirst section of the law\nto allow the Department of Agriculture\nto do a thorough comprehensive review of\nthe issues and problems that we're\ndealing with with medical marijuana in\nits production its distribution and its\nuse\nand to come back and give\nrecommendations to the governor\nlieutenant governor and the speaker by\nDecember 1st of this year\ntell us a plan going forward is this\ncommission working does he have\nsuggestions or ways to improve it would\nthe Department of Agriculture like to\nregulate this going forward in the\nfuture\nthere is some interest there\nand many of you are aware that the\nDepartment of Agriculture currently\nregulates and licenses the growing of\nhemp\nnow hemp is just a different strain of\nthe Cannabis sativa plant marijuana and\nhemp are brothers or sisters they're the\nsame strangest really differing mostly\nby the THC content in the plant\nso there's a certain symmetry there a\ncertain\nhistory ability expertise in the\ndepartment of agricultural to take a\ngood look at it and report back to us it\nis my expectation\nthat by the end of the year this\nlitigation should be resolved\nmay not but I I hope and expect that it\nis\nand that we don't have to worry about\nthat but let's say the appeals succeed\nand we toss out these licenses and have\nto start again this will give us to be\nfully advised knowledgeable informed on\nthe subject matter to decide which way\nto go next session\nI would urge all of you to\nsupport this compromise I know there are\na lot of people that are not happy that\ndidn't get their way or all of their way\nin some of this but I think it\ncomprehensively addresses it in a way\nthat we can be proud of and we can get\nit right going forward Mr President with\nthat unless there are any questions I\nwould yield the well you do have a\nquestion Senator Senator from 32nd\nthank you well Senator Yale I yield\nthank you um I'm just trying to get\nclarity on the numbers in other words\nthere's 26 000 people on the registry\nthat have cards\ndo you have any information about how\nmany licenses it actually takes to\nprovide enough THC oil for those\npatients yes we we had a number of\nhearings in regulated Industries on this\nissue not just this year but in past as\nthis bill has come through there\ntraditionally\nput it this way the two class one\nlicense holders that have already been\nissued\nand are already in the process of\nproducing the THC oil in the and the\nproducts each claim they can provide\nenough product to treat 300 000 patients\nand that's two of them so that's six\nhundred thousand in each of the class\ntwo licenses will be able to do about\nhalf as much again so we believe once\nthese all six licensees get actively\nproducing that it's well enough for over\na million patients\nbut it's it's interesting to have that\ncompetition because by having six\nproducers they can specialize in\ndifferent types of conditions that they\nmay be developing products for and it\nalso generates price competition between\nthem so what what we would want to\nhappen going forward is if if it's\ndemonstrated that these license holders\nare not able to keep up with the demand\nand adequately Supply then new licenses\ncould be expended extended in the future\nthank you Senator would you further\nyield for one more be glad to yield um\nI missed\nbut\nthe sorry misspoke the THC commission\ncameras commission whatever we're\ncalling it is it currently\nadministratively attached to the\nSecretary of State's office and you're\nlooking to move it to the Department of\nAgriculture no no it's separate it's\nindependent\nso we're not looking at moving it\nanywhere we're just deciding whether or\nnot go keep it uh\nopen for business going future or to\nshut it down and reconstitute a division\non the Department of Agriculture to take\nover those duties thank you thank you\nuh recognize senator from the 30th for\nquestion\nthank you Mr President Senator yield I\nyield just one quick question uh these\ndispensaries can we charge sales tax on\ntheir product\nI think you can but I don't know\nI'm sorry I don't know if that's deemed\na medical product maybe one of the\ndoctors could could answer that better\nthan I can what classification is THC on\nthe federal level it's a schedule one\ndrug thank you\nyou have no further questions so thank\nyou Mr President I yield the will break\nit down a senator from the 28 speak to\nthe measure\nthank you Mr President uh I rise today\nto speak in favor of HP 196.\num the senator from the 46th and I have\nbeen\non opposite ends of this issue really\nsince my time here but\num there is a few things in this bill\nthat he's captured that I'm in full\nsupport of and just wanted to touch on\nthose with you guys number one and\nprobably one of the most important\nthings we're doing in this bill is going\nand putting in a trigger for the\nlicenses meaning the tying those number\nof licenses to the number of patients on\nthe registry that is something back five\nyears ago when we did the study\ncommittee which I co-chaired with then\nrepresentative Michael Gravely we\nactually made that recommendation coming\nout of the study committee and it did\nnot make it into into the final version\nand so coming back and doing this now we\nwe may not totally agree on you know\nwhere that trigger should be but at\nleast it's there and so that part of\nthis bill is very important because as\none of those steps that helps take a\nlittle bit of the politics out of this\nand get it into really into a common\nsense bracket which doesn't always\ncommon sense and government don't always\ngo together so when we can mesh the two\nI think that's important\nnumber two having a dispensary at the\nproduction facility is very important\nbecause if you remember when we issued\nthe production license is the way the\nway it was drafted was we were pushing\nthem into rural Georgia so when we talk\nabout access for Rural patients it's\nimportant that they'd be able to have a\ndispensary in these rural areas because\num sure just\nuh\nsupply and demand most of your\ndispensaries are going to want to\nattract to your more metropolitan areas\nso that's a very important piece and\nthen number three I've also support the\nbusiness Court\nthis process that we're in right now\nis really has hindered the fact that\nwe're in the courts we should have had\nmedicine on the shelves a year ago and\nwe could have been had it not been for\nthe court cases so if we can kick this\ninto a business court and get it done a\nlot quicker again we're going to be able\nto get patient get that medicine in\nthese patients hands much faster so\nagain while I don't think this is\nperfect it is certainly a step in the\nright direction and urge your favorable\nconsideration thank you\nSenators yielded the whale does anyone\ndoes any other Senator wish to speak for\nagainst the measure\nchair here's none is there objection to\nthe previous question being ordered\nchair here's none the previous question\nis ordered\nquestions

Service\nCommission generally selling and other\nTrade Practices and motor fuel attacks\nthat completes the order Mr President\nmajority leaders speak to the motion\nthank you Mr President senators\nSB 146 is a bill we've already passed\nout of the Senate it's gone over to the\nhouse we made some small changes to the\nlanguage a mirror companion bill has\nalready passed the Senate regulated\nIndustries committee and is on the table\nfor your consideration today or\nWednesday I'll go over the changes\nquickly that were made to the bill and\nthen I'll ask for questions as you\nrecall the bill the underlying Bill\ndeals with three sections one is it\nallows for the sale of electricity for\nelectric vehicles to be sold by kilowatt\nhours and not time\nthe second portion of the bill deals\nwith the permitting the inspections and\nthe regulations that are applied to the\nEV industry and it will be authorized to\nbe enforced by the Department of\nAgriculture through the leadership of\nthe AG commissioner and section three of\nthe bill deals with the taxes that\npertain to the replacement of the Lost\nmotor fuel tax by the fact that these\ncars are propelled by electricity and\nnot motor fuel\nspecific changes that were made by the\nhouse are on line 76 where we made a\nmodification to the definition of\ndigital Network which is just a slight\naltercation that was suggested\nby the Legislative Council the intent\nshould remain the same as the previous\nversion line 88 the definition of\nresidence was altered somewhat given\nmore time to look at this exemption\nlegislative Council recommended the\nchange it ensures that the power source\nis on the same piece of property as a\nvehicle that is being charged it also\nworked on definitions dealing with\nmulti-family if you have the charging\nstations at a an apartment complex for\npeople who would be living there as\npermanent tenants people who live there\nfor 30 days or longer\nlines 248 as that an electric vehicle\ncharging station inspector who is\ndirectly or indirectly interested in the\nmanufacturer or the vending of an EV\ncharging station shall be disqualified\nfrom providing the inspector Services\nuntil their interest no longer exist\nit's basically a conflict of interest\nclause for anyone working for the\nDepartment of Agriculture lines 318 of\nthe bill strikes the sunset on the\nConsumer Price Index inflation measure\nfor motor fuel tax\nline 341 consolidates the gallonage\nequivalence ceiling to 11 kilowatt hours\nper hour that is a maximum rate that\nthey could charge as a conversion from\n11 kilowatts compared to the gallon of\ngasoline\nlines 342 includes the hydrogen gallon\ngallonage equivalent floor that was in\nrepresentative Jasper's Bill and House\nBill 406 it just mirrors that language\nand the last change that was made by the\nhouse is on line 437 which eliminates\nthe CPI index inflation measure for the\nannual fee on electric hydrogen and\npropane fueled Vehicles Mr President\nI'll plan I'm happy to take any\nquestions or I'll yield and ask for your\nfavorable consideration for SB 146.\nwe're going to have senator from the\n19th\nthank you Mr President Senator eugiel\nyes sir Senator first I want to thank\nyou for your work on this I know you\nspent a lot of time working on electric\nvehicles generally I didn't see the\nElectric Vehicle Commission in this bill\nis it in here the electric vehicle the\ncommission that we passed around no\nthat's a separate bill it was not\nincluded in this bill ever since we are\nnow in a position back and forth between\nthe house and the Senate would you\nconsider it a friendly Amendment if for\nan amendment to add the EV commission to\nthis map I'm assuming that bill is still\nalive and well in the in the house going\nback and forth so I would prefer to keep\nit separate if possible okay thank you\nconsidering the time that we have to to\nmake that Amendment thank you thank you\nrecognize the center from the 37th\nI think Mr President just gentleman you\nI do I appreciate your work on this as\nwell this is an important subject matter\nfor us I was a little confused on line\n341 yes\num\nit was my belief that the the\nelectricity equivalent of 11 kilowatt\nhours\nwould be framed as not less than 11\nkilowatt hours\nbecause what that does that would have\nthe effect of capping the tax rate\nif it's not more than 11 kilowatt hours\nthat'll have the effect to allow the tax\nrate on consumers to rise that that may\nbe something that was missing this\nprocess I know we spoke about that yeah\nso the 11 kilowatts would be the\ndenominator in the equation in the\nconversion so you take the the gas tax\non a gallon of gasoline let's say it's\n30 cents to equate that to the kilowatt\nhour you would divide the 30 cents by\nthe 11. so by changing that from 9 to 11\nit actually lowers the tax rate for the\nelectric car because the denominator\ngets larger and not smaller it was my\nunderstanding of the agreement was\num it it's just gentleman further yield\nyes sir I do it was my understanding\nthat the 11 kilowatt hours was going to\nbe the minimum to the gentleman's point\nif it was raised from 11 to 12 or 13 or\n14 that would have the effect of\nmoderating and bringing down the tax\nrate on consumers and not more than 11\ncents would allow the tax rate to rise\non consumers and I think I I was just\nasking is that intended and with a\ngentleman consider a friendly amendment\nto address I think it I think the intent\nis to do what it says and that is to\nallow for that rate to be raised from 9\nto 11 not to be a floor not to be a\nceiling but to be a floor But as time\ngoes on and inflation Rises the dollar\nvalue of a dollar will continue to\ndecrease so if the gasoline tax goes up\nto 35 cents per gallon then that rate\nwould also go up with the electric car\nso it would create parity what we're\ntrying to do is to make sure that the\npeople driving a gasoline-powered car is\nis paying the same rate as person that\nis driving an electric car and vice\nversa so as to allow for those two get\ntax rates to be basically parallel to\none another\nthank you\nyou have no question Senator thank you\nvery much I appreciate your favorable\nconsideration\nrecognize the senator from the six speak\nto the measure\ncolleagues I\nrise briefly to appreciate the majority\nleader for for the work on this bill and\nto also highlight something that was\nbrought up by the senator from the 37th\nbut also others related to the bill\nwhich is that there's still work to be\ndone I appreciate the fact that this\nbill doesn't go into an effect until\n2025 but I do think that there are some\nthings that we need to think about\nrelated to\num\nEV drivers and the fact that at this\npoint we have one of the highest\nregistration fees in the country and\nthis tax as currently written would be\nthe highest tax on EV drivers in the\ncountry which\nyou know if if the intent is to Target\nout-of-state drivers uh driving through\nGeorgia makes perfect sense but it would\nalso uh impact uh residents who live\nhere and who are helping to make uh\nGeorgia the EV capital of the country uh\nthese very workers would be driving EV\nvehicles and paying the highest taxes in\nthe country which doesn't seem to make\nsense in addition to that the bill does\nrequire Employers in Georgia to retrofit\ntheir Chargers\nto to meet the requirements of this law\nwhich would not only cost the employers\nmoney but would\naffect an employee benefit that many\nemployers use which is to allow\nemployees to charge while they're at\nwork this bill would actually prohibit\nthat which is concerning and something I\nthink that that in in uh\nif if we are truly concerned about uh\nabout consumers and particularly about\nthese out-of-state drivers then we want\nto make sure that in-state employees\nthat are working for Georgia companies\naren't impacted by this uh in fact the\nGeorgia Chamber letter uh talked about\nhow this bill targets consumers uh but\nthe but the indirect or the direct\nFallout from some of these Provisions is\nthat it will also impact Georgia\nemployees which I know we all don't want\nand I've had this brief conversation\nwith the majority leader and we've\ncertainly agreed that there is work to\nbe done particularly in the future on\nthis bill so I just wanted to highlight\nthe fact that there's still work to be\ndone\nand while I appreciate the effort that\nhas been done here let's continue to\nwork on making sure that Georgia is the\nelectric vehicle capital of the world\nI yield the well\ndoes any other Senator wish to speak for\nagainst

President\nrecognize senator from the 40 seat\nthank you Mr President senators\nyou know I have a speech we all do that\nI give to chambers of commerces and\nCivic clubs that I say one of the things\nthat is so gratifying and stimulating\nabout this job is it's like going to\nseveral different seminars a week\nso today I've already talked about\ndomestic terrorism on our critical\ninfrastructure we've talked about\nmedical marijuana and now we're back in\nthe world of law in the Civil Practice\nAct how do we handle depositions of\nhigh-ranking government officials or\ncorporate officials\nyou may remember this bill was before us\npreviously\nSenate Bill 200 it was amended on the\nfloor to the point where it was fairly\nwell obliterated of having any\nmeaningful impact and it was ultimately\nplaced on the table where it died of\npeaceful death there before crossover\nday\nthis bill\nis a bill from the center center from\nthe 19th bill that's in the back\nstarting at part two\nand that dealt with\nfalse advertising for Legal Services\nbasically I will not speak to that piece\nof the bill I voted for it in the Senate\nI'm fine with it as it came back from\nthe house unless the senator from the\n19th has problems if they made any\nchanges to that part\nmy problem is they put on this in the\nfirst few pages part one basically Pages\ntwo\nand three and a little bit on the top of\npage four what was originally house bill\n530.\nand house bill 530 was assigned to the\nSenate regulated Industries committee\nwhere we vetted it\nwe looked at it and even though it was\ncompletely more supportive of the\nplaintiff's bar than the original SB 200\nwas to protect businesses\nto keep our state the number one place\nto do business in the country\nthis one was not nearly as favorable to\nbusiness but was favorable to the\nplaintiff's bar\nas we vetted it we changed two words in\nthis bill\njust two words from the house version\nand I'll tell you what those were\nand now they have taken their original\nBill to avoid that\nminor tweak and put it on another Senate\nBill thinking they could slide it by us\nin the agree disagree process\nthank goodness\nthat we had a little time over the\nweekend to look at our rules calendar\nremember we met in mid-session on\nThursday and so I had time to know what\nwas coming today\nto catch this being tucked onto a\ncompletely unrelated bill\nso let's review again the issue in case\nyou don't remember from the last time we\nhandled this back in ancient history\nfeels like it doesn't it crossover day\nwhat this bill was in response to\nattempts by plaintiff's lawyers to take\ndepositions questing them under oath of\ncorporate presidents or high-ranking\ngovernment officials which some of us in\nthis room have been deposed in\nconnection with some recent litigation\nand realized sometimes you're being\nasked questions that you don't know\nanything about\njust because you're a member of this\norganization or you're a high government\nofficial or you're a high corporate\nofficial doesn't mean you know half you\nhave any personal knowledge of the\nissues involved in the lawsuit\nmany states have something they refer to\nas the Apex Doctrine think about the\nChristmas tree the Apex is the top when\nyou're taking depositions from people at\nthe top\nthey don't necessarily have information\nor knowledge about the issues that are\nin dispute like the design of an\nautomobile which was this General Motors\ncase that sort of generated this\ndiscussion in the state of Georgia\nrecently\nor whatever type of manufacturing\norganization you may if you're the\npresident of a pharmaceutical\norganization you don't know who did the\nclinical trials and exactly how they\nturned out you've got scientists and\nchemists and other clinical Specialists\nthat are finding that information out\nfor you\nwell these states that have an apex\nDoctrine some of them have them by\nStatute\nand SB 200 that failed here on crossover\nday was based on Florida's statute\nFlorida's a very business friendly State\nand I think they're thriving because of\nthat they got no income tax they have a\nvery uh ambitious governor who has just\npassed an enormous tort reform package\nthere\nto grade acclaim\nand they have an apex Doctrine and\nstatute that protects their corporations\nfrom being harassed by depositions\nhaving to set aside their schedule to\nanswer questions and be embarrassed and\ntry to be leveraged into settlements\nother states don't have it in a code\nbut the courts have created the doctrine\nthrough their judicial opinions and we\nrefer to that as the common law versus\nstatutory law\nGeorgia has neither up until today\nand this is an attempt to codify an Apex\nDoctrine to perfect protect High\ngovernment officials High corporate\nofficials from being harassed in\ndepositions on subject matters that they\nhave no personal information about\nnow\nI have an amendment here that that\nessentially\nreinserts the Senate regulated\nIndustries substitute putting those two\nwords or basically taking them back out\nof the house version\nand those two words are unique\nand complex\nthe basis of this Apex Doctrine is if\nthe person being deposed being\nquestioned does not have personal unique\nknowledge about the subject matter in\nthe lawsuit\nthat they can claim I'm not the right\nperson for you to depose and ask for the\ncourt to give them a protective order\nunder the house version in addition to\nthem having to have that unique personal\nknowledge\nthe corporate official or the government\nofficial has to show that they have a\nunique schedule\nand that they are working for a large\nand complex organization\nall we did in the Senate side was say\nyou shouldn't have to have a unique\ncalendar\nif you've got uh\nstressful steady problematic calendar\nthat ought to be enough it doesn't have\nto be unique like you're the only\ncorporate president in America that has\nthis type of schedule\nand it doesn't have to be a complex\norganization you're working for if it's\na large corporation or a large business\nand you have a busy schedule and you\ndon't have unique knowledge of the\ninformation you shouldn't have to be\nsubmitted to a deposition and so you\nwould still have the obligation the\nburden of going to court and say asking\nfor a protective order please protect me\ndon't make me have to go to this\ndeposition and explain your burden of\nproof why that you don't have personal\nknowledge about it unique knowledge\nabout the subject matter and that you\nhave a busy hectic type schedule even\nthough it might not be a unique schedule\nI had this amendment that puts those\nwords back basically takes those words\nback out only in the scheduling part\nand it also makes it clear that this new\nlaw that's aimed at corporate officials\nand high government officials does not\nundermine the existing Georgia law\nwhich allows you to seek a protective\norder if something is annoying harassing\nunduly burdensome in a series of other\nthings I wanted to make sure that by\ncreating protections for high corporate\nofficials we didn't raise the bar for\neverybody else also to be protected from\nabusive Discovery techniques\nI hope that explains it I really\nI mean sometimes I just just want to\npull my hair out how\nus attorneys will Dibble and argue and\nfuss and fight over a couple of words\nour rules chairman was in the regulated\nIndustries committee and made I wish I'd\nwritten it down maybe we could have had\nthe puppet lady do it he said something\nlike really is that all they're arguing\nabout this is obvious you know you can't\nmake somebody have to prove they have a\nunique schedule to be able to get the\nbenefits and be protected from this\nharassment I'll point out you will have\non your desk the letter of support from\nthe Georgia Chamber of Commerce this is\nan important issue to them this is a\nscorecard issue for them\nand all all the other business\norganizations in the state are to the\npoint\nwhere they're getting afraid to do\nbusiness here because the deck seems so\nstacked against them this site selection\nmagazine that says we're the best place\nto to do business it doesn't take into\naccount the legal environment\nor the judicial system it looks at the\nEconomic Development support the tax\nbenefits the workforce\nlet's don't let our state get to the\npoint where business are fearful to do\nbusiness here because they're subjected\nto unnecessary litigation unfair\nlitigation tactics\nlet's let them know how important\nbusiness is to us and trial lawyers Can\nYou Stand Down on two words complex and\nunique it doesn't undermine your\nabilities but it keeps you from making\nthe bill meaningless by making it so\nhard to utilize that it doesn't help any\nCorporation\nMr President I'm happy to take any\nquestions there may be you do have a\ncouple questions Senator Senator from\nthe 17th\nas Senator yield I yield\nSenator if you'll look at your Amendment\nonline three of your Amendment\nyes well you're adding the word large I\nhave two questions on this first you're\nadding the word large after any\nbut looking at line 51 of the bill\nthere's actually two innies there\ncorrect\nyes\nso is your Amendment not in order when\nit comes to what it's saying is it's\nputting it in both places\nokay so if we read it as you're saying\nthat then it'll say organization\nincludes any large governmental entity\nand any large other large organization\nyeah I think it should say any other\nlarge organization public or private if\nyou remember doesn't say that right\nI'd have to check the Legislative\nCouncil that's the intent let me see\nwell the other issue is you said you\nknow it says\nafter any and after other\ncorrect but if you put large after both\nanys which doesn't say that but it\ndoesn't say which any you're not putting\nit after both Denny's you're putting it\nafter the first Indian after the second\nother\nwell the further yield yes the problem\nis remember doesn't say that your\nAmendment says you're going to put the\nword large after any and he's written in\ntwo places\nso you remember so you're not correct or\nit can read it as it's written and the\nsentence will then say organization\nincludes any large governmental entity\nany other large other large organization\ncorrect that's the way it should read\nI think that's the way it\nand that's what you want to put in code\nI'm sure the code folks will straighten\nit and make it brighter that's the way I\nread it I can see how you could could\nsee here we go do you want to try to do\nanother amendment if there's an\namendment a I'd be receptive to it you\nthink you can clarify that\nyou asking me yeah do you think you can\nclarify that with Amendment 1A if not\nI'm happy to do that while we're well\nI'm not going to write your Amendment\nfor you Senator rather to go back to the\nbill that's passed by the house\nsee what I can do\nrecognize senator from 36.\nthank you Mr President does the senator\nI yield\nis it accurate to say it seems to me\ncommon sense to say isn't true that most\nanybody getting sued and getting deposed\nis not crazy about that process and\nrather not do it in most cases most of\nthe time most of the time\nand and it's hard to understand why the\npeople at the Pinnacle in their\ncorporations\nuh shouldn't be willing to stand for a\ndeposition the reason is they don't want\nto be asked about things they don't have\nany personal knowledge about and it's\nunreasonable to expect that a corporate\npresident is going to have finite Duty\ninformation about the duties of every\nperson in a ten thousand member\norganization that's why this only\napplies to large organizations and only\nif you don't have unique personal\nknowledge about it that's what's\nunreasonable is to question people that\nyou know don't know the answers and\naren't expected to know the answers to\nthese detailed questions about perhaps\nthe design of a product or the uh\ncompounds in a in a pharmaceutical\nproduct\nbut isn't it true that we've often\nlearned upon uh with say some of these\nlarge cases say with the tobacco\nindustry\nuh as the depositions and as the the\nlegal case moves forward and you get a\nperson in a high place on a corporation\non record in a deposition uh you can\nlearn things that you would not be privy\nto otherwise for example that uh that\nyes we hired a firm to spread uh\nthoughts uh uh information and and uh\nuse a rigged survey and a rig you know\nbogus science and that's how we came up\nwith this allegation that that tobacco\ndoesn't harm your health that's just an\nexample of a very large corporation\nfacing a lawsuit so it just would seem\nto me that this could provide blanket\ncoverage for accountability at the\nhighest levels of a corporation if you\ncannot get to them with a a cursory\nreview and maybe due to the limited\ncomments I gave I could see where you\nwould think that but this bill\nanticipates that and down in lines\n54-57\nthe burden shifts back if I were to say\nI don't want you to oppose me\nand you were then able to show the court\nI have exhausted all other means of\nDiscovery and it's been inadequate to\ngive me these answers I need and say\nthat person that's trying to get\nprotection does have unique knowledge of\none or more matters related to the\nsubject matter then you can get the\ndeposition so that's all you got to do\nif it turns out that there is something\nunique that that person knows and that\nyou can't find it out any other way you\nexplain that to the judge and then\nyou're allowed to go forward with the\ndeposition and it even gives the judge\nthe ability to restrict the questions to\nthose areas and to balance the interest\nof both parties and that's all we're\ntrying to do here let's don't be unduly\nburdensome on a corporation if they\ndon't if the person doesn't have the\nknowledge and it's easy for the\nplaintiff to find that information from\nasking the people that do if they can\nshow the court I can't figure this out\nany other method I can find out and by\ngolly I got proof that that person does\nhave some knowledge about it then the\njudge is going to allow the deposition\nto go forward but isn't it true that\nwhat you just described is like getting\nthrough the eye of a needle no yeah\nwhat you just that process you describe\nit creates a barrier to accessing that\ntop person in the corporation and you\ndon't necessarily know as the plaintiff\nthat's seeking that information the\nplaintiff's attorneys\nyou've created a barrier to their\ngetting access to what information that\ncould be vital just it just seems to me\nhighly protective uh and tilted kind of\ntilts the playing fields maybe so and\nyou know\nwe're down to I think we got eight\nlawyers in this room\nand out of us very few actually litigate\ncases\nand it wouldn't be obvious to you but to\nthose of us that are in that jungle\nfighting for a living all the time we\nrecognize there are other methods that\nyou can use\nand one of those the attorneys will know\nis called a 30 B6 notice of a deposition\nwhere you can ask the corporation\nhere's what I want to know about who\ndesigned this product who did the safety\ntesting on it you know who made the\ndecision whether or not to make the\nrecall you can ask to depose the person\nthat has the knowledge that you want to\nknow and you can make them designate you\na corporate official that can answer\nthose questions so you don't necessarily\nstart with the person at the Top If You\nknow the information you need there are\nother Provisions in the Civil Practice\nAct that allow you to ask for the person\nthat the corporation has to tell you I'm\nnot going to give you a guy that's going\nto Stonewall you I'm going to give you\nthe guy that knows what you want to know\nthat's how you get around this and if\nyou don't accept that and you think well\nyou know what I think this President\nmight have some particular knowledge\nabout it then you ask to take their\ndeposition and if they come back and go\nto court and hire lawyers and take the\neffort to say we want a protective order\nunder this law that we're trying to pass\ntoday they have to swear they have to\nshow I don't have unique knowledge about\nthese issues in the lawsuit and this is\nunduly burden some on me because I've\ngot a hectic schedule and I'm working in\na very large corporation can't be\nexpected to know this and what the house\nwants to do is to make you say in\naddition to that you have to show that\nyou've got some type of unique schedule\nthat nobody else in America's Got and\nthat you're in a very complex\norganization it doesn't protect the\nother folks which it's but it seems to\nme isn't it true that that this is an\nunlevel playing field when you put when\nyou take that when you take that unique\nuh the language out of the current law\nand that's that's the concern that that\nmany would have about people in high\nplaces being being protected by this\nlanguage that you're attempted to\nimagine I know and I'm sure you've been\nlobbied on that and that's why I'm glad\nyou're able to be open-minded and listen\nto me explain how it really works\nbecause Georgia has been designated as\nthe number one judicial hell hole in\nAmerica\nif your corporation these rules that\nyou're talking about a Level Playing\nField are not level they are tilted\nagainst the defendant against big\ncorporations and you know what when they\nsay judicial hellhole they don't mean we\ngot judges that are horrible\nit's the legal laws that these judges\nare enforcing that make it the hell hole\nand that's what we're trying to\nstraighten out is balance this playing\nfield up so we're not harassing\ncorporations that we're then asking to\ncome here and hire our citizens and give\nus jobs final question if you will yield\nisn't it true that if we are reportedly\nfor nine or ten years now the greatest\nstate in the in the country to do\nbusiness in that if if we did in fact\nhave a Judicial hell hole we wouldn't be\ndrawing all these corporations to come\nhere invest and build plants and hire\npeople as they are doing today isn't\nthat true the reason for that is because\nsite selection magazine that gives those\nratings will tell you the judicial\nenvironment is not even a factor that's\nmeasured in deciding and we ought to be\ngrateful to God that it's not because we\nwouldn't be number one in the country\nwe'd be far down the list and we\nwouldn't be nearly as appealing to these\nbusinesses by by our other Economic\nDevelopment incentives our tax\nincentives that we do our Workforce that\nwe use our transportation system that\nmakes it appealing they don't even put\nin that calculus what our judicial\nsystem is like and what these civil\npractice laws that we've passed and\nthese laws of evidence we passed and\nthese different tort laws that we pass\nhow they impact that system and these\nnuclear verdicts that we keep seeing\nthese gigantic verdicts that people look\nat them and say how can that be fair for\nCVS to be held liable for somebody\ngetting shot in their parking lot not\neven in their store doing business why\nwould a CVS open up in a place like\nBuckhead that's unsafe I don't know they\ngot about 1200 sites I think in Georgia\nso you watch them close I can tell you\nthe the\nstore about just a very few blocks from\nmy house shut down for that reason\nI think I've had enough taken enough of\nyour time Senator and I appreciate the\ndialogue thank you\nyou have no more questions Senator thank\nyou you're the well\nsecretary read the amendment\nSenator Hatcher from the 50th offered\nthe following amendment number 1A by\namending Amendment one to add this bill\nshall become effective when signed by\nthe governor uh Mr President I can\nswitch the order\nrecognize senator from the 50s to speak\nto the amendment\nthank you Mr President this amendment is\njust to make sure that that portion of\nthe bill does have an effective date so\nthank you I yield the well\nright\nrecognize the senator from the 19th\nspeak to the measure\nthank you Mr President\num\na lot of stuff has been said so I hope I\ncan help you Wade through it and provide\na simple course that just gets you to\nthe end of this bill for today\nSenate Bill 74 began as a lawyer\nadvertising bill heard the senator from\nthe 646th who's my good friend say a lot\nof things that I think are true\nhe said some things that talked about\nwhere we stand currently with our\njudicial system\nand I think attorney advertising has\ngotten to a point where the puffery the\nstuff you're allowed to say like I'm the\nbest Senator or you're the best Senator\nthis protected speech by the U.S\nConstitution has led to falsity\nit's not true when the guys stand on top\nof trucks and say you know they're the\nstrong arm what does that even mean\nand that falsity has now led to a belief\nin our legal system that's been has\nperverted the way that I think folks\nthink about our legal system\nthat's all Senate Bill 74 was meant to\naddress was attorney advertising and\nsimply say if you're going to advertise\nabout something as important as our\nJudicial System we think you ought to\ntell the truth\nand if you don't tell the truth you can\nbe sued for it and you can't just be\nsued for it you can be sued in a class\naction for it we think that protecting\nthe Integrity of the legal system is\nthat important\nwhen it went over to the house it did\nget a few amendments one we didn't make\nit very clear if the penalty the 500\npenalty was per advertisement or it was\nper the number of people who saw it and\nthat's kind of confusing because if\nyou're if it's a billboard that says\nthis and you go down I-75 is it 500\ntimes the 2 million people that passed\nit that day or is it 500 per the\nbillboard and the house fixed that and I\nappreciate that\nthey also added on what you've heard the\nsenator from the 46th referred to as the\nApex Doctrine why is it called the Apex\nDoctrine because the Apex is the\nPinnacle right the top\nand it's a an agreement that I think\ndefense and plaintiff's attorneys agreed\non that said hey\nit really isn't fair to drag the top\nperson of a company in the CEO for Coke\nand ask him why the can exploded in\nMcRae Georgia\nnot know that answer\nbut what the Apex Doctrine as it came\nover from the house said was hey\nif that CEO wants to be protected he can\nthen say I have no specific knowledge\nabout the Coke can in McRae Georgia I\ndon't know what the temperature was in\nMcRae Georgia that day have no idea\nabout the aluminum they got from\nwherever they did to make it\nand therefore I should have a protective\norder that protects me from having to\ntalk about that Coke can\nthe burden then goes over to the\nplaintiff the person who said Mr CEO you\nshould know something about that coke\ncan in McRae and the plaintiff has to\nshow two things on lines 58\num sorry 60 and 61 and 62.\nthat they have no other way of knowing\nwhat happened to that coke can that day\nwhat the temperature was of the aluminum\nused\nand that that person who they want to\ndepose has specific unique knowledge of\ngetting it\nthe version the house passed protects\nthe Apex of Corporations from having to\nshow up if they don't know anything\nthe senator from the 46th said the\nreason we want this amendment is because\npeople don't want to be drug into court\nto be CEOs don't want to be drugged into\ncourt to be asked about things they\ndon't have no knowledge about well\nthey're protected from that already in\nthis bill look at line 64. you see first\nof all if they bring that order and the\nparty can't show that they have specific\nknowledge anyway they're protected then\nthere's a catch-all afterwards that says\nto the extent that the party seeking the\nprotective order shows that an officer\nlacks unit unique personal knowledge of\nsome but fewer than all relevant matters\nthen the court May limit the scope of\nthe deposition accordingly there's\nalready a second fallback scope measure\nin this bill\nwe were told that this was what was\nadded on was the sentence language but\nthat would be Senate Bill 200 it never\npassed this body it didn't make it out\nof the conversations in other rooms\nwe were told that this building that we\nhave a Judicial hell hole and then the\nsenator one of the other Senators\nbrought up that were number one for\ndoing business and I do disagree with\nthe senator from the 46th that if all\nthese things were included we'd be way\ndown the list I think the governor and\nthis body and the body across the hall\nhave done an amazing job of champion\nGeorgia and I do not subscribe to the\nnotion that we're anything except number\none for recruiting business\nthere was a mention of nuclear verdicts\nwell why would we not pass this as it is\nto protect those CEOs to protecting\nthose situations\nand last but certainly not least\nthe reason why I would ask you to oppose\nthis amendment is the exact same reason\nthat I didn't put an amendment on the\nlast bill of the senator from the 51st\nI asked him should I put an amendment on\nabout EVS the EV study committee that we\ncared a lot about and he said no I think\nthat's moving somewhere else\nbut the other part of that is this if we\nput an amendment on right here what\nhappens\nit has to go back across the hall and\nget voted on again\nwe're now in the last 36 hours of\nsession and we have a chance to reject\nthis amendment and pass this bill that\ndoes substantially what the senator from\nthe 46th is asking and it's done we know\nit's over and it doesn't go back from\nthe across the hall for ties up in games\nthat just fell on day 40 for waiting for\nanother year\nso how do we get there well that's where\nI need your help\nthere's an emotion to agree as amended\nif you open up your Senate Rule Book\nYou'll see in special orders that a\nmotion to agree is amended takes\nprecedence over a motion to agree that's\nwhy even though this is my bill and I\nmove to agree the senator from the 46th\namendment to agree is amended he got to\nspeak first\nso for my motion to agree to finish this\nissue and cap cap it off and be done to\nhave a chance we have to vote down the\nmotion to agree as amended and that's\nwhat I'm going to ask you to do and then\nI'm going to ask the president if I can\nmake a motion to agree immediately\nthereafter and then ask you to agree to\nthe bill the house version the house\nsubstitute to the Senate Bill 74 and\nthen we will be done you will have\npassed the Apex Doctrine and there will\nbe a tort Reform Bill that makes it\nthrough both Chambers this year that's\nwhat I ask you for I hope you'll follow\nme on Mr President I'll yield for\nquestions\nyou have no questions Senator thank you\nso much I yield the well and I guess ask\nagain that you vote down the amendment\nand that you wait on me then to make a\nmotion to agree soon\nER from the eighth would you what\npurpose do you rise the senator yielded\nI was just going to ask him if he could\ndraw a diagram for me to keep up with\nall the heavens like he just said\nI can shorten it he said his stuff's\ngood and the other stuff's bad\n[Laughter]\nIndian that's just what he this is what\nhe said\nsenator from the six you'd like to speak\nsenator from the 18th\nokay posture we're in right now is\nthe amendment which is in order\nis on the is this a senator from the\n50th on his Amendment 1A\nis their objection to Amendment and then\nwe will ask the\nof course Okay so\n1A senator from the 46 objects to\nAmendment 1A\nand Senator you can go ahead and close\ndebate now if you like with your\nobjection\nthank you Mr President\nwell I may have seen it all now\nI've got the governor's floor leader\ntrying to kill this bill to protect\nbusiness in Georgia\nand the governor\nHigh government officials because the\nsenator\nfrom the 50th knows full well that our\nrules only allow you to amend an\namendment once and by adding this silly\nAmendment only changing the effective\ndate of this bill he prevents me from\nfixing the glitch that our Judiciary\nchairman showed if it's even a potential\nglitch\nso yes I am against 1A\nthe effect of that would be that now a\ngovernor could only ask for a protective\norder if somebody's harassing him in a\nsix or eight hour deposition on some\nsubject matter he knows nothing about\nunless he can show that he has a unique\nschedule now what the heck does that\nmean something different from every\nother governor in the country\nsomething what is unique is one of a\nkind right\nhe's making our governor and all of our\ndepartment heads have to go show that\nthey have a schedule that nobody else\nhas\nor else they're not even eligible to\nbring this motion\nnot only do they not have knowledge but\nthey can't even ask for protection\nunless they can show that they have a\nunique schedule and they are the head of\na large and complex organization\nthink about that at any level of\ngovernment and in any levels of business\nyou are this is only available to the\nhigh ranking officers which we have\ndefined as people that have these\nextensive schedules that are unique\nand hard for them to find the time\nto be sitting down giving a deposition\na high-ranking officer\naccording to this house version\nmeans somebody that has unique and\nextensive scheduling demands or\nresponsibilities\nso how do you prove that to the judge\nI don't know if he's bringing this in\nhis capacity as the governor it's floor\nleader or as a private plaintiff's\nattorney\nbut this amendment 1A gets the bill\nbecause it tries to keep and that's what\neverybody here is trying to do\nthey're trying to make it that gum near\nimpossible for a government official\nincluding a lot of us in this room or a\nhigh corporate official to get\nprotection from the court\nI ask you to reject this let's pass the\nthe bill with these tiny changes\nthey're getting 95 percent of what they\nwanted across the hall every other\nword's left fine\nexcept these two works of who it applies\nto they're they're essentially making an\nexception that swallows the hole where\nnobody can take advantage of this unless\nthey can approve the court that there's\nsomething about their schedule that\nisn't just extensive but it's Unique\nit's a one-of-a-kind thing and it\ndoesn't tell who it's Unique as to other\nhuman beings other corporate officers\nother government officials other people\nat your same position\nit is built to kill the protections that\nthe bill was intended to do stick with\nour business community on this\nChamber of Commerce and all the the\nbusinesses that support this and want to\nbe able to continue doing business in\nGeorgia vote against amendment 1A\nvote for Amendment 1B that fixes the\npotential glitch I'm not sure it even is\nthe the order of where you put large\nafter other or after any\nand support amend this agree as amended\nby Amendment one thank you I yield the\nwill\nall right we have a late arriving\nAmendment or Amendment 1B\nAmendment 1B secretary read the caption\nKaiser the 46 offers the following\nAmendment 1B amend Amendment one to the\nhouse committee on Judiciary substitute\nto SB 74 by replacing line three with\nthe following by adding large after\nincludes any and after any other online\n51.\nyeah\num\nall right so now we're in the posture uh\nwe're going to take up Amendment 1A\nauthored by the senator from the 50th uh\nand there is objection from 1A senator\nfor the 46 objected to 1A uh all those\nin favor of 1A will vote yay all those\nopposed nay secretary unlock the machine\nI'll recognize the senator from the 46.\nSenator uh I mean Mr President this\namendment does not identify\nwhat bill it is what it's amending 1A it\ndoesn't identify it by\nthe Senate bill it doesn't identify it\nby the\nLC number this is a defective Amendment\n1A\nSenator the vote has already started\non the passage of the amendment the yeas\nare 34 and the Nays are 20. and this\namendment has passed for we centered\nfrom the 46 what purpose you rise motion\nreconsider on the grounds that it's an\ninappropriate Amendment it doesn't uh\nState exactly what we're amending there\ndoesn't identify it clearly\nand for general purposes to reconsider\nthat vote\nall right Senators asked for a motion to\nreconsider his objection\nobject from the center for the 19th all\nthose in favor of motion to reconsider\nwill vote yay all those opposed nay\nsecretary unlock the machine\nall in the motion to reconsider the\nyears are 15 the 40 the Nays are 40 and\nthe motion to reconsider has failed\nall right so now we're on the senator\nfrom the 46 base motion of agreeing to\namend\nall those in favor of the Senator's\nposition from the 46 will vote yay all\nthose opposed nay secretary will unlock\nthe machine\nsenator from the 14th what purpose do\nyou write Mr President uh parliamentary\ninquiry State your inquiry isn't that\ntrue that this is the most that any\nhuman beings have ever discussed the\nApex Doctrine\nI think the senator knows what he speaks\non the original motion by the senator\nfrom 46 the yeas are 11 and the Nays are\n45 and that motion has failed now we go\nto the the author of the bill senator\nfrom the 19th to uh now his motion will\nbe in order so Senator thank you Mr\nPresident I move that the Senate agree\nto the house substitute to SB 74. all\nright Senators move that he agrees as a\nsubstitute from the house substitute uh\nis their objection\nthere is objection would you like to\nspeak to the bill senator\nthank you for sticking with me this far\nI just ask you vote green one more time\nthank you a lot\nrecognize the senator from 31st you like\nto speak\nforeign\nI know everybody's having fun with this\nbill in this room but at the end of the\nday this bill does not help Georgia and\nwe could talk about the economy what's\ngoing on I'm sure and somebody in here\nwill chastise me about citing the State\nof Florida you know in terms of them\ndoing real tort reform and I'm sure\nthere's going to be trial orders coming\nfrom Florida Crossing that southern line\ndown there the senator from the 13th\nDistrict coming over here filing more\nlawsuits so we we can do what we want at\nthe end of the day but this is\nridiculous vote red thank you Mr\nPresident\nSenators yield of the whale senator from\n17th you still only speak senator from\nthe 18th you'd like to speak\nthank you Mr President\num\nso why are we here\nwhy are we what are we talking about\nwhat is the issue what are we trying to\nfix what is the problem\nwell we've gotten down this path and\nwe've talked about all these procedural\nissues and stay with me on this one and\nlet's do it on that one and what's going\non over the house and we've lost sight\nof what this bill\nis fundamentally about and what we ought\nto be trying to fix\nokay\nand it's simply this\nthat there are times that lawyers\ninappropriately use the rules of civil\nprocedure\nto make\npeople that are at the head of an\norganization be it a CEO or a governor\nor someone in charge of a governmental\nentity\nsit for a deposition when they don't\nknow anything about the fundamentals of\nthe issues in the lawsuit\nnow why would they do that\nwhat would a lawyer do that\nwell follow me with just a little bit of\nmath here there's 365 days in a year\nso what do we work maybe about 300 days\na year\nand if you're a Apex person if you're a\nCEO of a large corporation\ntake one of the Big Mac automobile\nmanufacturers\nhow many lawsuits do you think they have\nabout\ntheir product liability\nand go on down the line\na whole lot more than 300\n. so what's one of the things you could\ndo to put pressure on a company\nto put pressure on the company\nto settle with you at rates that aren't\nreflective of what the case is really\nabout you've just harassed and haranged\nthem enough they're gonna pay more\nthan what the case ought to pay\nor what the justice system would\notherwise provide\nhow many suits do you think pick any one\nof the automobile manufacturers do they\nhave pending at any one time\nseveral hundred couple of thousand\nso it doesn't take much math to see that\ncrafty council could actually tie up the\npresidents of companies every day\nworking day of the year just for the\npurpose of having to sit for in federal\ncourt you can have to sit up seven hours\nfor a deposition\nthat's what we're trying to prohibit why\nbecause folks that is fundamental and\nI'm going to use a non-lawyer word that\njust ain't Fair\nit's not fair to make folks sit for\nthose depositions when they don't know\nanything about it I'm not going to get\ninto the yan yan back and forth about\nthe wording of this or the procedure of\nthis I think we lost sight of what the\nbill is trying to do what is the Apex\nDoctrine trying to establish what is it\ntrying to protect\nand it is just a recalibration in making\nsure that when lawyers use the federal\nrules of civil procedure or the Georgia\nrules of civil procedure to take a\ndeposition\nthat the person you're deposing\nhas information about the matter that\nyou've sued on yeah there's a lot of\nlegal words and we can peel that back\nbut that's fundamentally what this is\nabout\nand if not\nthose people in those positions ought\nnot to have to sit for a seven hour\ndeposition\nthat's taking them away from their real\njob\nand lawyers that do plaintiff's work and\nI do plaintiff's work sometimes\nought not to have to be able or ought\nnot to be able to compel them to sit for\na deposition just because I know if I\ncan harass him enough or her enough\nmaybe they're just going to decide to\npay money\nthat's fundamentally what this is about\nand unfortunately I think what we're\nleft with was 74.\nas it came over\nand as a senator from the 31st spoke to\nthe bill that you've got to vote on 74\ndoesn't help the fundamental inequity\nand unfairness of what I just described\nand that's what the center from the 46\nhas tried to do\nand I don't have any reason to believe\nanybody wants to waste any more time on\nthis but if you if you do Wonder go back\nand look at the regulated Industries\ndiscussion that was had with the house\nmember that came over and presented this\nwere the words unique and whatever the\nother words were were debated for about\n30 minutes it got nonsensical\nso who's really trying to be fair here\nand come up with a common sense\nyardstick by which we judge when people\nthat are in charge of organizations\nought to have to sit\nand I think that the bill that was\nworked on did unfortunately this one\ndoes not\nand that's what I don't want us to lose\nsight of because that's why we're here\nthat's the problem we're trying to fix\nand this one doesn't do that\nI'm happy to answer any questions Mr\nPresident otherwise I'll deal the well\none question Senator uh senator from the\n17th\nas Senator yield sure I'll be happy to\nSenator sir you opposed to passing\nSenate Bill 74 as passed in the house\nas I understand the bill 74 which this\nwas not my bill and I didn't spend the\ntime probably not as much as you did Mr\nchairman\nbut as I understand I think the author I\nthink the center from the 46 and the\ncenter from the 31st spoke to why this\nbill doesn't accomplish what's needed to\nhave a functioning balanced Apex\nDoctrine under Georgia law would you\nfurther yield sure wouldn't you agree\nthat the language in this bill is\nsomething that we know their support for\non the earth side of this building and\nthat the language that was presented a\nminute ago is obviously not supported by\nthis body at this time and does not have\nsupport across the other side of the\nbuilding as well the problem Senator is\nthat just because we know that they're\ngoing to support something on the other\nside if it doesn't in fact address the\nproblem if it isn't a fair approach to a\nsolution that's no reason to vote on\nsomething in this chamber just because\nwe know that they'll pass it do you\nfurther yield sure so it's your position\nthat the language we have in front of us\nwith this bill even though it has\neverything that you're just speaking of\nwith the exception of the two words\nunique and and you would rather not\nsupport this and have nothing at all\nSenator that's a mischaracterization\nthis does not have everything in it that\nI would want to have in a bill but this\nis not my bill I'm not the sponsor of\nthis and so I can't speak to the details\nof that but I will tell you that I don't\nthink this bill as presented for us to\nvote on in totality does what an apex\npolicy Doctrine ought to have in it\ndo you further you sure wouldn't it be\nbetter to pass a compromise bill that I\nthink no one really loves but at least\nputs the Apec docs Vape Peck stocks in\nour code versus passing nothing at all\nexcept for this the problem and the\nconcern is that this bill actually can\ntake us backwards because if it creates\na paradigm where this is your only\nrecourse\nand you don't have the other recourses\nthat are normally available in the Civil\nPractice Act no\nand that's the difference\nthank you Mr President I yield the well\nokay Senators yielded the well\nwould you like to speak senator\nparliamentary choir\nState your inquiry\nis it not true I was gonna well I was\ngoing to ask the senator from the 18th\nat the end of the day is it not true\nthat this is all about politics and\nmaking a bill look like maybe something\nthat's totally not such just putting\nlipstick on a pick so somebody can get a\npolitical win out in the hallway\nSenator is passionate about what he\nspeaks\nSenator would you like to close\nthank you Mr President\nI know it's kind of gotten silly at this\npoint but I I don't think this Topic's\nsilly\nwe heard a couple of things just now\nabout having to sit in federal court for\ndepositions well the Civil Practice Act\ndoesn't apply to Federal Court\ndoesn't matter\nwhat this bill actually says\nis that if you are a high-ranking\nofficial in a government entity\nor any other public or private\norganization\nyou can say and try to show good calls\nfor why you shouldn't be deposed\nby saying you lack unique personal\nknowledge\non the subject matter involved in the\npending action\nafter that happens\nI said the plaintiff's attorney but I\nguess it could work both ways\nthe plaintiff's attorney though then\ngets to say no I've gone every other\nplace I can to find this information and\nyou're the only one that has it\nand you actually are the one that has it\nnow I can depose you\nhow is that not sensible\nthis is the middle ground I'd ask you to\nvote Green close this issue completely\nit does not have to go back across the\nhall and we can debate the next issue\nthank you Mr President I yield the book\nSenator has yielded\nsenator from 46 would

have served in this Senate chamber for\nquite some time now\nless than some of you but\nmore than most of you\nand in only a few occasions can I tell\nyou that we're going to do something\nthat's so meaningful\nand so powerful\nto honor someone their memory and their\nlegacy\nas well as the great work that has been\ndone by their family\nHouse Bill 188\nis known as mariam's law\nand its legislation ensure that\nGeorgians are protected from our most\ndangerous sexual predators\nthe need for this legislation originates\nfrom the 2019 Supreme Court decision\nPark first state that ruled that\nunconstitutional for sheriffs to\ncontinue monitoring dangerous dangerous\nsexual predators after they completed\ntheir probation sentences\nfollowing this decision this body\nstudied the issue with a senate study\ncommittee on protection from sexual\npredators\nand many of you made recommendations\nthat came a part of this very bill\nsince that time\nboth myself representative Sainz and so\nmany others\ngot connected with the family\nwho has a deep personal interest in this\npolicy change and why it was made into\nMiriam's law\nyou see in 2021\nMiriam\na 27 year old woman was kidnapped from\nher doorsteps after returning home from\nwork right here in Atlanta\nand was murdered\nthe murderer who is currently awaiting\ntrial for her death\nhad multiple prior sexual felonies\nincluding\nattempted rape of a minor\nI want to take a moment to recognize\nMiriam's Brother Ali\nand her best friend Irene and all their\nfriends and supporters that are right up\nhere in our Galley Gallery today\nyou have done amazing work\nthrough advocacy and honoring her memory\nwithout question Miriam is looking down\nfrom heaven right now smiling at both of\nyou\nI want to thank our lieutenant governor\nand his staff for assisting us with this\nbill\nand helping make it a priority for our\nSenate and our house\nthrough the accuracy work that Miriam's\ncase\nthe family learned about the Gap in\nstate policy and they specifically went\nout to solve the problem\nthis individual should have been known\nshould have been leveled and monitored\nas a sexually\ndangerous predator\nas determined by the sexual offender\nregistration review board also known as\nsorb\nhowever that risk assessment\nnever occurred due to sorb's large\nbacklog and funding constraints\nI want to thank\nsorb\nas they have been instrumental in\nhelping us craft this language in\nsupport of the bill along with the\nsheriff's Association other law\nenforcement groups and the prosecuting\nattorneys Council let me give you the\nbill as highlights Bill changes the name\nof the sexual offender registry\nsoarb to the sexual offender risk review\nboard this bill provides updates to 13\nsexual felony offenses rape child\nmistake molestation and sexual battery\njust to name a few this bill provides an\nindividual who is conceived\nor convicted of two of these felony\noffenses will serve life in prison or a\nsplit sentence to serve the remainder of\ntime on probation and monitored by the\nstate actively\nthe bill grants an offender after 10\nyears on probation the ability to go\nback before a judge for additional\njudicial review\nand the bill has Provisions later to\nsorb allowing them to monitor these\ndangerous sexual predators and offenders\nwho have had at least two felony\nconvictions\nand will be monitored by the Department\nof Community Supervision until their\nofficial leveling process is completed\nthis bill grants an appeal process for\nindividuals who can't show their\nleveling is not accurate\nand therefore you have a four amendment\nthat makes it abundantly clear what that\nprocess is today\nthe four Amendment simply gives that\nappeal process for those dangerous\nsexual predators codified into this bill\nmy fellow senators\nto the family to the friends to\neverybody who has been involved in this\nI'm going to ask you to light this board\nup green today\nlet's lock arms\nlet's honor The Life and Legacy of\nMiriam let's make sure this never\nhappens again\nand Godspeed to her in heaven I yield\nthe well\nthank you Senator breaking down the\nsenator from the 14th speaks of the\nmeasure\nthank you Mr President\num I rise in support of the bill\nI want to give my condolences to the\nfamily and uh to honor the work that\nthey've done to try to make sure that\nthat story never happens again\nuh I want to be candid with you all I\nhave voted against previous versions of\nthis bill that were more expensive for\nthe last few years in the house and\nactually became a campaign issue you can\nimagine in one of my campaigns because\nit's difficult to inject conscience in\ndiscussions about the criminal justice\nsystem\nI want to thank the chairman and the\nsponsor of the bill for adding the\nappeal language I think that creates a\nfair result with respect to being able\nto challenge classification but just\nlike I did previously today and I'll be\nbrief because I know we got dinner to\nget to but I just want to drop a flag in\nthe sand because to be very clear about\nthe way that this bill works\nthe issue is ankle monitoring\nthe issue is there's a few hundred\nGeorgians who are convicted of previous\nsexual offenses that law enforcement and\nthe governing authorities want to be\nable to put ankle monitors on and the\nSupreme Court of Georgia said the reason\nyou can't put the ankle monitors on past\na sentence is because that's\nunconstitutional it's a fourth amendment\nissue to put an ankle Miner on somebody\nfor longer than their their you know\nvalid sentence\nI have concerns always about using the\ncriminal justice system and increase\npenalties as a administrative work\naround to try to solve what is\neffectively an administrative monitoring\nproblem and I I think we should just\npause and recognize that this should be\na green board today but\nthe thing that we are doing is we are\nmaking mandatory life sentences for\npeople who are convicted twice of these\noffenses and one of the offenses is\nstatutory rate 21 year old and let's say\na 15 year old bad idea really bad don't\ndo it but if it happens twice the judges\ndon't even have discretion it's a\nmandatory life sentence on that second\noffense so you know My Philosophy with\nhow we do work in here is if you're\ngoing to make a choice own your choice\nI'm voting green today because I think\nat the end of the day we need some kind\nof a fix but I'm not going to miss the\nopportunity to drop a flag in the sand\nand just say we got to be careful when\nwe use sentence exposure as a way to\nsolve what are effectively\nadministrative monitoring problems and\nso with great respect for the sponsor\nfor the family I think that we can\nsupport a measure in memory of somebody\nspecial but also maintain that\nconscience about future bills that come\nup and how we use a criminal justice\nsystem with recognition great gravity\nand seriousness and understanding that\nthese circumstances are very unique in\nthis system these are repeat offenders\nuh that that I think you know I\nunderstand why the sponsors brought the\nbill so I just wanted to add that note\nof conscience uh and and we'll see you\nall in a little bit for dinner but\nthanks Mr President\nthank you Senator Senators yielded well\nsenator from the 34th would you like to\nspeak to the measure\nthank you Mr President members of the\nSenate I Rise\nfor a brief moment just to say\nI appreciate what

process\nand myself and senator from 23rd kind of\ndisagreed on something that was going to\ngo to the voters well this isn't that\ncase this went through that process all\npersons in Augusta basically are on\nboard with this particular project we\nall had give and take we all talked\nabout it and we're 100 in favor of this\nmeasure so we ask for your favorable\nsupport and with that I yield well\nrecognize center from 56 speak to the\nmeasure\nthank you Mr President I have great\nadmiration respect for uh my two\ncolleagues here uh it's in the 23rd and\n22nd my concern is not the great work\nthey're trying to promote for their area\nof the state my concern is for the\nIntegrity of the splash system and I\nalong with many of us have worked\ndiligently on that over the last many\nyears\nthis opens the door to the very thing we\nwere afraid of what happened with this\nblast\nwe have a mechanism to do things today\ncity of Atlanta has most of the folks\ncoming from the outside in\nand they use Hotel Mel till taxes as\nwell as their existing tax base and they\nbond things out in order to build them\nAlpharetta Georgia which are\nrepresentative for 12 years does the\nexact same thing in fact they balloon\nfrom 60 000 people during the day to two\nto three times that when businesses come\nto town my concern here is we are\nopening the door and next year we'll\nhave a 158 new requests of everybody\nelse who will find something in their\ncommunity that more sales tax will have\nbe that can certainly be beneficial but\nif our goal as Republicans is to have\nthe sales tax hopefully be used to lower\nthe income tax\nthen that would be a much better place\nto do that in this state there is only\none area that has a tax that is higher\nthan everywhere else and you're right\nhere in Atlanta it's at 8.9 percent and\nthere's only one reason for that because\nof a federal lawsuit that we had to fix\nthe sewer systems and put a separate\nspecial one percent sales tax on\nso they would be at 7.9 percent\nAugusta Richmond will be at eight and\nnow eight and a half percent the highest\nin the State minus the one that is\ntrying to overcome a federal

Network companies\nit was a new new technology A New\nConcept\nso there was some concern\nabout making sure the the Riders were\nprotected and we required them to carry\none million dollars in uninsured and\nunderinsured motorist coverage\nnot liabilities for something that\nubered the Uber driver or Lyft driver\ndid but liability for a third party that\nwere to hit the the car or cause cause\nsome sort of injury to the passenger not\nUber or Lyft\nthis has proved to be quite costly for\nthese companies and of course they have\nto pass that cost on to the ridership\nand they tell me that Georgia is one of\nthe most expensive states in the country\nFord Transportation Network companies\nbecause of this and they've asked for\nsome relief to put it in perspective our\ntaxi cabs and our limousines are only\nrequired to carry 25\n000 injury per person 50 000 per\naccident of\num coverage and that that's in line with\nwhat our minimum State liability limits\nare so it's not an unreasonable ask and\nbut instead of going all the way to the\nstate minimum the compromise that was\nagreed to was to have a\num limits of three hundred thousand\ndollars\nand that's that's what this bill does\nlet me see if I can find it in the bill\nall right so in line 24\nit strikes 1 million and it says with\nminimum limits of 300 000 for bottle\ninjury to her death of all persons in\nany one accident with a maximum of a\nhundred thousand dollars for bodily\ninjuries to or death of one person and\n25\n000 for property damage\nif you have any questions about that or\nhow that coverage would

is\nrequired to provide in case their\ndrivers hurt somebody\nno sir we're just reducing the uninsured\nmotorist coverage so it would not\neliminate or reduce the liability that\ncaused by their driver or by Uber it\nwould be from a third party\nwhat does the current law require a\nmillion dollars in uninsured motorists\nalso yes sir okay thank you senator\nyeah no further questions Senator

house committee substitute to\nSenate Bill 62 by striking lines one\nthrough ninety that completes the order\nMr President\nI recognize the senator from the 41st to\nspeak to the measure\nthank you Mr President I Rise to ask\nthat you all would support my motion to\namend let me give you a reminder we had\nthis bill in the Senate and we worked on\nperfecting it together by making some\namendments in the first place so this\nbill has to do with homelessness and how\nwe legislate how counties and\nmunicipalities deal with the issue of\nhomelessness we had a long and robust\nconversation in this body already where\nwe came to a place where lawyers\neducated us about the term writ of\nmandamus y'all remember that I still\ndon't know what it means but it's not a\ngood word because we got rid of that\nword we also got rid of a whole lot of\nother things until what we had left\ntogether as a body was for all federal\nfunds and all dollars related to\nhomelessness for them to be audited\nthat's where we landed\nin this body with sb62 and so I'm simply\nasking that we go back to that same\nplace where we take time to have a full\naudit of how these monies are used and\nthat we also make sure that we get rid\nof this writ of mandamus where any\nperson can come and Sue and we have to\npay their fees as they sue so again this\nis fundamentally about returning to the\nwork that we did as a body by calling\nfor an audit and not introducing\nadditional burdens on our cities and our\ncounties as it relates to homelessness\nI will take questions if they're you\nhave no questions senator\nI recognize the senator from the 14th to\nspeak to the measure\nthank you Mr President massive shocker I\nsupport the amendment and I think\nthe thing you know the theme we keep\ntalking about with criminal legal system\nis tightening the screws turning up the\nheat in order to solve problems this is\nrelated this is a similar type of\nmeasure in the sense that it turns the\nscrews on local governments to try to\nsolve a problem that is so layered\nmultifaceted and complex that this type\nof hammer just doesn't do what we would\nlike for it to do I mean you know I Echo\nuh the center from the 41st and\ncommending you know the the intentions\nand the purpose of a bill like this\nwhich is try to attack a really\ndifficult problem but I mean I'm you\nknow right now I'm going to more\nforcefully call for pause than I did on\nthe last bill before dinner for a lot of\nreasons but I mean one of them is you\nknow what are local governments going to\ndo in a situation like this obviously it\nhas to be a written policy and so they\nwould have to have a written policy of\nuh you know prohibiting enforcement of\nan order and that you know may be rare\nbut local governments oftentimes do lack\nthe political will to take firm action\non issues like this because of how\ndivisive they are and by forcing their\nhand we don't make the problem any\neasier solved so I you know I'm starting\nto repeat myself but I guess the the\nreal issue I've got is you know some of\nthese policy debates are not amenable to\nbite-sized discussions like these on an\nindividual bill with individual uh\nconsiderations in language this really\nis a a discussion that's much broader\nthat has to do with investment in\ncommunities on all the different policy\nfronts we talk about health care\neducation Etc and I know we're impatient\nI know that we don't think that those\ninterventions work quickly enough and we\nwould like for them to work faster but\nwhen they don't work fast enough for us\nwe can't turn to knee-jerk solutions\nthat again Force local governments to to\nyou know move move deck chairs around\nand not be able to really address the\nproblem so I apologize if I sound kind\nof frustrated I think it's just you know\nwith the late hour and moving on\nsomething like this uh I I think it\nfeels good to say we're doing something\nbut I don't think this is going to do\nwhat we want it to do so I would\nrespectfully ask that you vote Yes to\nthe amendment and know on the underlying\nBill if the amendment doesn't pass I\nwould yield for questions Mr President\nyou do have a question Senator uh\nsenator from 30th\nthank you Mr President with a senator\nyield for Just Two simple questions I\nwould Senator when you say Paul's are\nyou talking about the polls like we did\nlast year in the session where we did a\nstudy committee over the summer to come\nup with the legislation that you see\nbefore you well I think the center is\nwell aware that I wasn't here and so I'm\ntalking about the body Senator right\nabsolutely so what what I mean by that\nis obviously I don't have direct\nexperience with the actions that the\nSenate may have taken uh but uh but no\nwhen I say pause I mean longer than a\nyear and longer than a study committee\nbecause again these types of issues are\nso intractable and they're so widespread\nI mean a lot of ways you can think of\nhomelessness or many of the other ills\nthat we have as symptoms of underlying\nconditions right we have an apathy\ntowards our neighbors right we we have\nan unwillingness to live in proximity to\nour neighbors not just people who\nexperience homelessness but you know\nmaybe people who live in a different\ntype of housing than we're used to right\nI mean we hear the phrase NIMBY a lot\nand so I think you know when I say pause\nwhat I mean by that rhetorically is\nbefore we rush to you know Implement\npolicy that's just going to turn the\nscrews turn up the heat on governments\nthat don't have easy solutions to this\nlet's take a step back and really think\nabout how layered and complex these\nproblems are and find the political will\nto make the tough Investments across the\nboard thank you senator those were\nexactly the points that were discussed\nlast year during the study committee the\nsecond question I have for you\nis you said it's not solving the problem\nin your mind is what we're doing right\nnow to address the problem working\nno but I mean there's an analogy I like\nto use a lot in public policy context\nand that is the idea of let's say a\nhouse is on fire and you want to put the\nfire out on the house but you can't find\nany water around all you've got is a big\ntub of gasoline it wouldn't make any\nsense to say well the only thing we've\ngot to throw on this fire is gasoline we\ngot to throw something so let's throw\nthis right the reason I like that\nmetaphor is because that is the way we\nthink a lot about public policy problems\nthat are really tough and and we tell\nourselves there's not water available to\nput out the fire but it just takes I\nthink some patience and some recognition\nthat these problems do not get solved\novernight and require real faith in our\nneighbors and investments in community\nthat again may fall on partisan lines\nsometimes but but are deeply and\nfundamentally about believing in our\nneighbors\nyou do have a couple more questions from\nthe 41st\nSenator you yelled I do Senator isn't it\ntrue that we did have a bipartisan study\ncommittee on homelessness over the\nsummer on which I was a participant in I\nbelieve that is true and Senator isn't\nit further true that in our bipartisan\ndeeply well-studied studied committee\nthe only thing that we could all\nactually agree on was the need to study\nwhere is the money going because we\nheard from all these different\norganizations that are funded from\nphilanthropy money and federal dollars\nand the one thing isn't it true sir that\nwe could agree was that we needed to do\na full audit to understand where the\nmoney was going Senator given my\nunderstanding of the Venn diagram of\nGeorgia politics I would imagine that\nthat is that Center space that you're\ntalking about and and I think that you\nknow let that is in line with the idea\nof pausing to make sure we understand\nwhat we're doing with the money we're\nalready spending but before we resort to\ntactics that the local governments don't\nwant that only maybe one party in this\nchamber agrees with and won't\nfundamentally get at the root of the\nproblem do you further yield I do\nI believe it's also true isn't a true\nSenator that in that whole many meetings\nand hours long study committee that we\nnever had any discussion about hospitals\ndropping off patients and yet this bill\nsuddenly is talking about hospitals\ndropping off patients who are homeless\nisn't it true that that was not a part\nof our hours and hours long study\ncommittee if the senator States it to be\ntrue and one thing I would say is that\nyou know I think part of the description\nof this bill is going to be oh but we're\nprohibiting drop-off this is an\nanti-drop-off provision not if you fall\nunder one of the unless Provisions right\nunder it right and so what this bill\nwould do is legitimize a system of drop\noff under certain conditions that local\ngovernments could justify I mean there\nare real like false imprisonment issues\nand you know Fourth Amendment seizure\nissues that go into transporting human\nbeings and I think for us to move on\nthat and to facilitate a legal type of\nforced Transportation by local\ngovernments is a dangerous step if we\ndon't all agree on it senator\nuh senator from 36. thank you Mr\nPresident Senator you I do uh thank you\nfor your remarks and uh essentially\nas I understand it\nyour your point is and the thrust of the\namendment which I support is that online\non page five\nsection four\ncalls for a an intensive\nuh data Gathering and audit of spending\non homeless programs and services\nStatewide\nuh it's true that doesn't occur\novernight is that the case uh really\ntaking a deep dive and and getting\ninformation from all the sources that\nare out there\num is\nit is was it the core recommendation of\nthe study committee and should be at the\nheart of this bill as opposed to these\nother things that have been added isn't\nthat true absolutely Senator I think\nit's the obvious first step and I think\nagain given how layered and complex the\nissue is this is particularly one where\nyou don't want to jump in you know head\nfirst addition if I could uh further\nquestion we have we are in the process\nuh in the second year of addressing\nmental health parity\nuh it's widely documented that many of\nthe unhoused people uh\nthat have no roof over their heads are\nstruggling with mental health issues or\nsubstance disorder issues isn't that the\ncase and that we are in the midst of a\nprocess that we\nfirmly hope is going to have out\npositive outcomes for services for\npeople struggling with mental illness\nand as well as substance abuse disorder\nit's not the case Senator that's\nabsolutely right I think it speaks to\nthis broader theme which is you don't\nsolve a problem by putting it out of\nview and I know that some proponents of\nBill will say well no we're Banning that\nbut not if you're fall under one of the\nlegal exceptions this is in essence a\nsuperficial response to homelessness\nthat doesn't do the hard work of getting\nto know our neighbors of investing them\nand waiting until we have the\ninformation we need to know how to treat\nour neighbors humanely\nuh thank you for that and further\nquestion uh this very body has supported\nrobustly both parties uh co-responder\nmodel where\npeople are approached\nnot with a Law and Order heavy beatdowns\nbut instead\na law enforcement is accompanied by or\nsubstituted in some cases with a mental\nhealth professional isn't that the case\nand that we have this is a new Step that\nwe're modeling for some very successful\nefforts in some counties isn't that\nright it is Senator and and that and\nthat we are still\nhoping to build that out Statewide isn't\nthat the case and and yet again another\npositive approach that people have\nUnited around to address the issues\nfacing our homeless population and\nfacing the municipalities and counties\nas well that are seeking to struggle\nwith this problem it is Senator the last\nthing I'll say in response is what we\nknow is that delicate well good policy\nthat is carefully crafted by a bunch of\nstakeholders is very delicate it's a\nvery delicate compromise that has a hard\ntime getting into rooms like this and\nsurviving because in a room like this\nwe're driven by what the need to give\nvoters results outcomes results look\nwhat we did we took action and complex\nproblems like this not always\nsusceptible to that type of politics\nthank you for that response and and\nfinally many of us are planning to go to\nthe opening this week of a center just\nhere uh very adjacent to the capital uh\nthe the police alternative diversion uh\nproject that's not a project any longer\nit's a building out program that\ndemonstrates success and merits more\nfunding and that's going to be available\nto people just Thursday afternoon at\nfour o'clock right here in our\nneighborhood if you want to learn more\nabout how these alternative approaches\nare working and uh is one more good\nreason in the case that we should we\nshould stick with this language on line\n92 to 104 and move forward in a positive\nthat's right and while acknowledging\nthat the bill makes some accommodation\nfor diversion I think what we don't want\nto do is turn the screws up in every\ncase that doesn't fall under some\ncarefully limited exception you know to\nto use what the kids would say on Tick\nTock let them cook you know let them let\nthem finish the projects that we're\nalready starting and uh and see where\nthose go thank you senator\nyou have no further questions senator\nsenator from 13th\nthank you Mr President\ncolleagues here we are talking about\nhomeless again\nactually we've spent more than last year\ntalking about homeless we spent about\nthe last two and a half years talking\nabout homeless and since I came into\nthis Senate body I've counted a homeless\npopulation go up between my little ride\nfrom where I live when I'm in Atlanta to\nthis Capitol daily and nightly\nI can take you right now and take you\nout to the bridge out here where the\nCoca-Cola museum is and I promise you if\nyou're not looking where you're going\nand you run over the curb which is only\nabout four inches high you'll take out\nanywhere between 15 and 20 people before\nyou can stop your car\nit grows all the time every person we\ninterview every person that came in our\nstudy committee said Homeless is getting\nworse and worse and worse\nit was not getting better\nwe all know that this bill attempted to\nmake a difference about homeless in\nGeorgia not Atlanta nothing is\nindigenous to Atlanta we're talking\nabout Georgia that's this little part\nthat was added over the house we sit and\nwe debated it over in the house and I\nworked with the representatives that\nadded the part on there and I personally\nthink it's a great add-on because what\nwas going on was\nI will not call out law enforcement I\nwill not call on ambulances I will not\ncall out these different government\noutfits but they were picking up\nhomelessness and they were taking them\nto like for example in Athens-Clarke\nCounty because they have a facility to\nhandle them they were dropping them off\nthere from other counties and that's not\nright each County must deal with\nhomeless each county has to have a plan\nto deal with homeless and what we're\ndoing is is we're forcing a county to\ndefinitely deal with homeless and make\nsure they know that they're going to get\nthe funding which the audit should tell\nus where the monies are what's going to\nbe done for homeless and that's the\nproblem folks none of us in this Capital\nhave a clue how much money is out there\nin homeless\nnone of us\nwe're talking 10 million and we're\ntalking 200 million we don't know\nwe don't know how many 501 3cs are out\nthere we don't know what they're doing\nwith the money we hope they're helping I\nwant to think they're helping but the\nreality of it is folks we can do better\nwe can do better and the law what we\ndecided when it was debated in this\nchamber we took out the cute Town action\nand we added the mandamus action from\nthe senator from the sixth over here he\nadded the mandamus action in which I\nagreed to and I agree too because I am\nnot a lawyer I'm just trying to make a\nproblem I'm trying to deal with a\nproblem and hopefully find a way to make\nit better so I would tell you up front\nwe added a part about local governments\nin the audit now have to participate in\nthe audience because it was brought to\nour attention over there that we were\nonly dealing with Federal monies so now\nwe made it that all areas encompassing\nall-encompassing has to deal with the\naudit and everybody must comply with the\naudience so we find out all the money is\nout there not just some All the Monies\nthat are sitting out there so I would\nask you that you'd not vote for the\namendment let's move this good bill\nforward folk got a money let's do\nsomething about homeless I live in\nCordele Georgia I'm 145 miles from here\nwe have a little bit of homeless problem\nnothing like we got in these big cities\nup here you want to make a difference\nmake a difference vote for this good\nbill and do something about homeless and\nlet's quit arguing about how we're doing\nit and create worry about these Party\nLine crap vote let's do something with\nhomeless and get on with it because you\ngot a good bill here you got to build it\nprotects people that's not allowed to\nhaul them off and just drop them off\nsomewhere under a piece of garbage\nand it going to find out where they're\ngoing it's going to find out audit and\nhave an audit Trail and find out where\nthey're going and last but not least\nfolks we might actually make a\ndifference\nwe might actually make a difference\nplease turn down the amendment let's\nvote for uh House Bill uh Senate\nsubstitute 62. are you on the wellness\nbrother all right\nsenator from the 41st would you like to\nclose debate\nthank you Mr President\num I I'm actually really grateful to be\nable to follow the senator from the 13th\nbecause we do agree with we agree with\neach other about the thing that he was\nmost passionate about which is that we\nneed to audit we need to do a full and\ncomplete audit of where the money goes\nwho has the money and is the money being\nused well if you notice it from his body\nlanguage that was the thing he got most\nexcited about most activated about it's\nthe audit and that's exactly what my\nAmendment does it leaves the audit\nintact and so I strongly encourage you\nlet's be deliberative let's return to\nthe very place where we started because\nremember when we passed this bill out of\nthe Senate all it called for was an\naudit because we wanted to know where\nthe money comes from I will tell you I\nwas in that study committee and the only\nthing we could agree about\nin a bipartisan way was that we need to\naudit the money because once we have a\nfull audit then we can make some\ncalculated and important choices and\ndecisions about how to best use that\nmoney until then\nwe just need to hold on and allow the\npeople who are out in the hallways and\nwho are out across the street and who\nare doing the work every day with people\nwho are experiencing homelessness who\nare doing their best to get people in\nthe house and we need to let them\ncontinue to do that work while we do the\naudit and then when we have the audit we\ncan make different choices if they are\ncalled for so I do urge you please vote\nYes on my Amendment I'm going to agree\nas as amended thank you\nall right Senators yielded the whale\ndoes any other Senator we speak for\nagainst the measure\nchair hearing none here's the pot

to provide for the that\ncompletes the order Mr President\nis their objection\nto the motion without objection uh\ncalling the senator to the\nof the 29th speak to the measure\nthank you Mr President colleagues we're\nall familiar with this piece of\nlegislation\nwe sent it over we went through the\ncommittee process through the house as\nit should have done we worked hard on\nthis legislation I want to recognize my\nmy my good friend representative Gullett\nwho has been working on this rep this\nlegislation with me for three years now\nand\nthe additions that were made through\nthis process was a an appeal process to\nthe superior court judge within the\ncircuit where the D.A is uh\nis is practicing and is elected and also\nuh added was additions to point out\nthe opportunity that if a Judicial\nCircuit district attorney fails to\nperform their duties provided under code\nsection 15 18 6 or solicitor fails to do\ntheir Duty under 15 1866 that it shall\nconstitute grounds for recall of that\nindividual what they have done is they\nhave taken an excellent piece of\nlegislation and they have made it better\nand I ask that all of my colleagues vote\ngreen on this so that we can close this\nGap within the criminal justice system\nand move forward with making Georgia the\nsafest state to live in in the United\nStates of America thank you so much and\nI look forward to your green vote Mr\nPresident I yield the well\nSenators yield of the well recognize the\nsenator from the 42nd\nyou\nyou don't have to say anything Senator\nif you don't want to\nthank you Mr President\num this is a huge sea change in uh the\nlaw as it stood for hundreds of years\nyou know here in Georgia so I just\nwanted to go back over some of the very\nuh incisive and important arguments that\nthose against this particular piece of\nlegislation make when we're talking\nabout an attack on a duly elected\nDistrict Attorneys throughout our state\nof Georgia who serve the people who have\nelected them DA's are elected officials\nand are accountable to the people and\nthe community that they serve that's who\nelected them\nstripping local DA's of the autonomy to\nmake decisions around the safety and\nwell-being of their local community\nerodes the rights of those local\nresidents and the voters to choose the\nleader that best reflects and furthers\ntheir vision for the justice system in\ntheir community in which they live\nsecond guessing these duly elected local\nprosecutors undermines local control and\nerodes community self-governance\nspreading out the prosecution function\namong DA's in each County avoids a\nconcentration of too much power in one\ncentralized entity\nhere's the facts DA's have always had\ntremendous discretion throughout our\nhistory to prosecute or decline to\nprosecute cases\nand they regularly exercise discretion\nin classes of cases from bail to\nsentencing requests to old outdated laws\nthat are on our books but routinely not\nprosecuted now such as crimes against\nadultery\nefforts to undermine their discretion or\npush that discretion into the Shadows\neven worse\ndeprives voters of the opportunity to\nhold prosecutors accountable for their\npolicies by their voters the ones that\nthey are responsive to and the ones that\nthey have that have sent them to their\nseat\nin a world of very limited\npublic resources something that all of\nus understand here in this chamber\nDistrict Attorneys simply cannot\nprosecute every single crime and Petty\noffense that occurs within their\njurisdiction they must make decisions on\nhow to use their precious resources\nwithin the permissive borders of\ndeliberate deliberately Broad and\nplentiful criminal laws they they serve\nas Ministers of justice and are actually\nethically bound to pursue those\ninterests already\nthe ABA rules make clear that it is the\nresponsibility of a prosecutor not to\nserve just as a zealous advocate but to\nquote unquote do justice quote do\njustice unquote on behalf of the people\nit is the onus is on these duly elected\nDistrict Attorneys to promote Public\nSafety in the communities that they\nserve that is not a one-size-fits-all\nacross the whole state\nand there actually is substantial\nevidence\nthat in many instances some of the more\npunitive and overweening approaches to\ncriminal justice actually end up\nundermining Public Safety as they\nundermine Community Trust\nthank you Mr President just wanted to\nlay out some of the points again about\nthe uh overthrow of district attorneys\nin this state being able to serve the\npeople that elected them and I'm happy\nto answer any questions and if not I\nwill request a no vote and yield the\nwell you uh you do have a question\nSenator uh senator from the 37th thank\nyou Mr President does the lady yield of\ncourse isn't it true that we elect our\nSuperior Court judges here in the state\nit is true isn't it true that the the\nactions of Superior Court judges are\nsubject to the voters as well they are\nthey are um is it true that we have a\nJudicial qualifications commission\nthat's been in place in Georgia since\n1972. that is true but there is a key\ndifference Senator would you Advocate\nthe repeal of the jqc what I would\nAdvocate is that all prosecutors in the\nstate fall under this new body and in\nthe this legislation they do not which\nis a key difference with the judicial\nqualifications Council moreover not all\njudges are attorneys but all district\nattorneys are attorneys and then\ntherefore they are beholden to the State\nBar of Georgia and all of its rules as\nwell as the American Bar Association and\nthe same cannot be said of all judges in\nthe state of Georgia isn't it true that\nall Superior Court judges in uh in the\nstate of Georgia are attorneys and their\nmembers of the bar they are but that\nparticular body that you brought up\noverseas more than Superior Court judges\nhaving made that point I'm the I want to\nget back to peer Court judges the point\nis we've got a process in Georgia isn't\nit true to deal\num have a have oversight of our judges\nwho have a role that's that's at least\nas important as DA's I think it's high\ntime isn't it true that we have a\nsimilar organization that even though\nDA's are locally elected there's still\nprofessional accountability across the\nstate thank you Senator I think that you\nmake a great point and that's why I\nthink too it would have been wiser to\nnot create a constitutional class\num with certain\num constitutional issues that arise in\nthis bill treating different prosecutors\ndifferently by exempting certain classes\nof prosecutors in our state from this\nnew oversight Commission in a way that\nis not done in the judicial oversight\ncommission and I agree with you that it\nwould have been smarter to take that\napproach and then we could say that it\nwas applied equitably which again would\navoid some of the Constitutional\nproblems with this particular piece of\nlegislation thank you Mr President\nthank you Senator Senators yield of the\nwell\ndoes any other Senator which speak for\nagainst the measure\nhearing none\nso the posture we're in is that the\nSenate has agreed to the house\nsubstitute on Senate Bill 92\nis their objection\nis their objection\nyou object okay\nall right so uh now that uh\nthose in favor of the motion will vote\nyay those opposed nay secretary unlock\nthe machines\non the on the passage of the bill the\nyeas are 32 the Nays are 24 and this\nbill has prevailed\nall right we're getting close y'all\nwe're getting close\nI recognize the senator from the 54th\nfor a motion\nMr Mr President\nI move that the Senate insist on his\namendment to house bill 142.\n[Applause]\nthe Senate has insisted on his position\non hospital bill 142. secretary read the\ncaption\nHouse Bill 142 a bill to be entitled a\nknack to amend chapter 8 of Title 20 of\nthe

and\nuniversities\nthe Senate offered the following\nAmendment\nto amend House Bill 142 by striking 500\non line 16 and replacing with 200 by\nstriking one quarter on line 17 and\nreplacing with one tenth that completes\nthe order Mr President\nSenator I recognize senator from the 54\nto speak to the speak to the motion\nthank you Mr President my friends a few\nremember we passed this by a unanimous\nvote in this chamber with a small change\nand all this bill does is it creates the\nunified police force for Spelman College\nClark Atlanta Morris Brown and Morehouse\nCollege we overwhelmingly passed this\nbut with a small amount of amendment and\nthe purpose of that amendment was to\nmake sure that we're protecting students\nwe don't need to be running radar out on\nthe city streets but we need to make\nsure that when these kids are on campus\nthat they're being looked at so we won't\nbrought it in that to 200 yards outside\nof the campus the police are allowed to\npatrol but to keep them constrained to\nthe campuses so they'll therefore they\nwill keep our students straight uh Mr\nPresident if any questions I will yield\nthe will\nthe Senate stands strongly behind
