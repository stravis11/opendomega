do all\nof what you said okay thank you\nchairman you for one more question yes\nspeaker chairman Martin to your right\nhas a question\nchairman chairman Hatchet to Yale yes\nsir isn't what you're doing here is if a\nCounty school board has no Chin no\nchoice in the matter of taking something\noff the tax roll which is what Freeport\ndoes isn't it true that what this bill\nwill do is not count that against them\nwhen their five mil share is being\ncalculated so it would actually be a\nmore fair way to just distribute the\nmoney it may add it may take away across\nthe state but isn't that what you're\ntrying to do with the bill correct thank\nyou\ngentleman has no further questions thank\nyou Mr Speaker and I will yield the will\nand ask for your favorable consideration\nthank you Mr

chapter 66 at title 36 of\nthe official code of Georgia annotated\nrelating to zoning procedures still\nsurvived for the length and renewal of\nmoratoriums related to the zoning\ndecisions this bill ever referred to the\ncommittee on governmental Affairs that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass by committee substitute\nrepresentative Washburn is recognized to\npresent the bill\nyeah\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house I Rise to present\nHouse Bill 514 the bill has three parts\nuh the first bill the first portion uh\ndeals with moratoriums on single-family\nresidential construction\nand the bill proposes that local\ngovernments would be limited on those\nmoratoriums to a time period of 180 days\nafter that they could not impose an\nadditional moratorium for for an\nadditional 180 days now I would want you\nto know that the Georgia Municipal\nAssociation and the association of\nCounty Commissioners had come had some\nconcerns about this language and I asked\nthem to bring suggested language that we\nincluded in the bill which basically\ngives some conditions that that time\nperiod can be extended and those things\nare things like a state of emergency\ndeclared by a federal state a local\nemergency management agency a natural\ndisaster\nany other set of conditions or\ncircumstances it might pose a danger to\nhealth or safety also an order for any\nfrom any federal state or local agency\nwith jurisdiction over the government\nthat ordered them to extend it and then\nlastly if they had engaged a\nprofessional firm to do some sort of\nConsulting work relative to that sort of\ndevelopment and that work was not\nfinished they can extend the moratorium\nuntil the work is finished we did ask\nfor GMA and accg to suggest language and\nthat was the language they suggested and\nwe negotiated with them to put that in\nthe bill the third the second portion of\nthe bill has to do with limiting fees\npermitting fees to the cost not to\nexceed the cost of administering that\npermitting process the last portion of\nthe bill\nallows local governments does not\nrequire but allows local governments to\nwaive fees on housing that is for units\nthat are 2500 square feet or less\nif they choose to do so in order to\nincentivize more single-family\nconstruction Mr Speaker that is the bill\nand I urge a favorable consideration\nfrom the members of the house and I am\navailable for questions\nokay the gentleman's beautiful for\nquestions to your left representing\nStacy Evans has a question\nMr Speaker does the gentleman yield yes\nma'am what was the magic of 180 days and\ndid the committee or you consider other\ntime periods and if so why were those\nrejected uh we were asked to look at\nthis issue by the uh Home Builders\nAssociation of Georgia and actually\nthere was a suggestion for a shorter\ntime period actually there was a\nsuggestion of 90 days but uh we we felt\nthat 180 days\nwas acceptable do you yield further yes\nma'am\ndid you hear from any local governments\nfor example the city of Atlanta or\nothers that had wanted a longer period\nand if so why did you not consider a\nlonger period in this bill\nwell we did hear from the city of\nAtlanta actually we invited them in to\ntalk about this bill and another housing\nBill we were doing\num we just felt like that this would be\nsomething that would be acceptable\nuh to put that time period on it thank\nyou\ngentlemen yield\nyes remember Roberts from the 52nd has a\nquestion thank you Mr Speaker does the\ngentleman yield yes ma'am isn't this\nbill\nuh isn't it true that this bill does not\ndeprive any of the local governments\nfrom denying a zoning application or a\nbuilding permit it's simply puts some\ncontrols on some of these blanket\nmoratoriums that we've seen in some\njurisdictions and by providing those\nexceptions you have that the ACC G and\nGMA have given you it it really doesn't\npose much of a risk because if there's\nsomething serious the cities can still\nimpose longer isn't it true yes ma'am\nthis bill does not affect their ability\nto do zoning it is about moratoriums on\nsingle-family Construction\nrepresentative Darlene Taylor straight\nout in front of you has a question does\nthe gentleman yield yes ma'am Madam\nchair does this bill make\num it availability for developers to\nmove forward when local governments\ndon't feel like they have the roads\nunder control or school um\ntaken care of if it's not ready and\nprepared to assume this new growth\nwell it allows them to declare\nmoratorium for any reason for 180 days\nbut they are they cannot continue to\nextend moratoriums over and over again\ndoes the gentleman further yield yes\nma'am what happens at the 180 days if\nschool projects haven't been addressed\nor roads aren't prepared or Water\nSystems aren't in place will they be\nable to move forward without that\nyes ma'am according to this bill they\ncould not refuse to permit single-family\nconstruction after 180 days\nthank you\nrepresentative fry to your left has a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman\nyield\nalways for my friend\npresident Boston isn't it true that I\nfully applaud you for the work that you\nhave done\nlifting the heavy loads for the\nsingle-family construction industry at\nthis time of its most necessary time of\nexistence when we're in the middle of a\nhousing crisis isn't that true if the\ngentleman saw states do you further\nyield yes sir isn't it true that this\nbill does not take away one single\nzoning power\nof our municipalities or our counties\nand that if these counties or\nmunicipalities wish to\nnot have a single family zoning then\nthey wouldn't have to be affected by\nthis bill at all is that correct\noutstanding\num\ndoes the gentleman further yield yes sir\nall right isn't it true that you are the\none of the few Representatives that\nactually heard our state leadership\nwhen they said we needed to do something\nto reign in the municipalities\nand get more doors in the market\nand build more homes for people in this\ntime of an unprecedented housing crisis\nin the state of Georgia is that not true\nthat is true sir\nthank you\ngentlemen yield I will\nwe have a lot of bills let's see\nchairman David Knight to your right has\na question thank you Mr Speaker to my\nfriend well do you heal\nuh yes I do you Mr chairman to my good\nfriend I I do have this is a serious\nquestion I know that in some communities\nsome counties\nuh perhaps moratoriums have been put put\nin place because of a rush if you will\nan influx of of a lot of Development\ncoming\nisn't it true though that some of these\ncounties may not be prepared from a\npoint of view of\npermitting in regards to having the\ninfrastructure needed to do the\npermitting process for for instance\nepd issues uh clearing permits those\nsort of things\nhow would this affect those those\ncounties that are trying to deal with\npreparing and setting up the\ninfrastructure within that local County\nGovernment\nto properly prepare for\nnew in an onslaught in some cases of\nthese residential facilities\nthat's my concerning question to my\nfriend\nwell thank you I think the best way to\nanswer that question is if if a if a\nlocal community has a lack of sewer\ncapacity for instance\nwell they can't issue sewer taps and so\na permit to build a house could not be\nissued this this the intention of this\nbill has been that for communities who\njust\ndon't want any more growth but don't\nhave these issues that are being pointed\nout\nuh the intention is that we all know\nthat our state is growing and growing\nrapidly and the people have to have a\nplace to live and we are always\napplauding that growth and applauding\nthe growth of the industry is coming\nthe reality is if a local community can\njust declare a moratorium\nand say well we just don't want anybody\nelse coming\nwell then we're allowing them to build\neconomic walls around that County and\nCity\nand I just uh the intention of the bill\nis not to hinder them or put them in a\ndifficult situation because they don't\nhave infrastructure it is to control\nthose candidates who decide that they\njust don't want any more growth right\nnow and they're trying to stop that\ngrowth\nMr Big I will yield for an additional\nquestion if needed chair lady Smith\nstraight down the front aisle has a\nquestion\ngentlemen yield yes ma'am first of all\nthank you for all the hard work you put\ninto this and you have identified a\nproblem before our state for housing is\nthat not true yeah yes ma'am it is the\nconcern in the area where I live is that\nmy single family homes\nare having developments coming in\nthat would need better roads and access\nin other words they're going to be\nlandlocked with poor traffic control is\nit not true that this moratorium could\nbe used as a negotiating fool tool to\noutlast this concern therefore creating\nthe opening the door or opening the gate\nto have to develop without giving\nquality of life access to Transportation\naround their communities\ninto the lady show States\nchairman Powell to your right in the\nback has a question\nthank you parliamentary inquiry\ndo you have a question I'm sorry well\nthe gentleman yield uh yes sir Miss Jim\nis it not true that this bill that you\npresented in no way stops local\ngovernments from being able to control\ngrowth in their in their jurisdiction\ngiven the tools that they have in their\ntool boxes\nyes sir that is true is it not true that\nyou also worked in uh in in good faith\nwith accgg and GMA and y'all came up\nwith additional language that would\nexempt certain parts of that moratorium\nuh that is true Mr chairman is it not\nfurther true that this bill needs to\nmove forward because of a lot of\nmisinformation it was put out across\nthis state to the intent of this bill\nbut at the end of the day that these\nlocal governments once they do a\nsix-month moratorium they need to reach\ndown and solve the problems they have by\nusing all the resources that they have\nif the chairman so States and I agree\nwith that assessment further question is\nit not time for you to sit down\nMr chairman I am sure that is corrected\nwell Mr Speaker I asked for the

substitute\nchairman Powell is recognized to present\nthe bill\nthank you Mr Speaker and ladies and\ngentlemen with the house I bring to you\nthis afternoon house bill 196. this bill\nis is the product of a couple years of\nwork now for the benefit of all the new\nmembers in here I want to give you a\nbrief time frame seven years ago we\npassed the medical cannabis act to allow\nthose people who qualified for the\ndoctor's excuse to get a medical\ncannabis card\nwell that was seven years ago\nand I remember it was probably one of\nthe most touching scenes I'd ever seen\nin this house that we had families we\nhad children we had all of those folks\nthat through all the Sciences had\ndecided that cannabis oil was actually a\ncure-all it wasn't the double weed of\nthe old it had been portrayed over the\nyears\nfour years ago this legislature passed\nthe Cannabis Act\nto allow for the licensing of six\nGrowers and those processes to refine\nthe oil and to open up dispensaries four\nyears ago ladies and gentlemen\nand there were some flaws in the bill\nand I'll tell you throughout the\npresenting the bill itself what they\nmight have been but there were flaws\nalong the way\nwell that was four years ago\nwell there was a lot of stuff that was\nsubject to us to look at now your\nregulated industry's committee\nby no means could I say that that commit\nis lightweight and I want to thank the\nmembers both past members of the last\nthree years and this year for bearing\nthis commit this process out\nlast year we had hearings we brought in\nthe people from over to cannabis\ncommission but yet in no time could they\neven testify or to acknowledge any\ninformation to a standing house\ncommittee\nand their view was that in the law that\nthey didn't have to and they were sworn\nto secrecy well I would tell you as a\nlesson not just to this exercise but all\nlegislation all government agencies need\nto be subject to administrative\nprocedures and open records but that was\nfour years ago\nbecause of the process of their how they\ndid their evaluations there was a number\nof protesters nine protesters that took\nit to the to the mat they hired a filed\ntheir protests they went to court and\nthat process is tied up into the court\nof appeals right now and several other\njurisdictions which it could be go on\nand on and there's tros out there that\nhave stopped the other four from being\nlicenses being issued until this is\nheard in the courts now that being said\nI will remind you that there's two\nclasses the two class one licenses they\nwere issued a license before the tro\nkept literally days before the tro\nkicked in to stop them so these two so\nthese two licenses they're in full\noperation getting ready to open up and\nI'll talk a little bit later about what\nwe've done is what has happened is that\nthey have actually created\na monopoly of two in this state and\nthat's not the intention I don't think\nit's the intention of this legislature\nbecause of things happen when you have a\nmonopoly so that being said I want to\nget into the guts of this bill\nand I would thank a lot of people in\nhere a lot of this is uh my original uh\nand regulated Industries our original\num\na way to solve this problem was a\nstraight shot\nand that was to give all of those\nprotesters to give them a license\nbecause they had standing in the courts\nand to give them a license to get get\nthem out of court so that this process\ncould go on and thanks to a lot of the\nwork of the leadership and some other\nfolks here there were some changes that\nwere made into this and it might be a\nlittle bit better for a lot of people's\ntaste to do that but I want to go\nthrough the bill with you if you would\nlook on section one this puts the\nCannabis commission under the\nadministrative procedures act and open\nrecords\nsomething that will guarantee that\nquestions can be asked and the whole\nprocess can be viewed in section two\nthis defines that they will also be\nunder the department of administrative\nServices rules and regs when issuing of\ncontracts\nat the end of that section two this says\nthat any appeals from a final decision\nwill be made to the Georgia Statewide\nbusiness Court\nthat's quite an interesting change and I\nthink that might bring a lot of a lot of\nthe issues about these appeals to bear\nsection three it adds a dispensary\none of the things that we did that all\nof the those are licensed were\nauthorized to have five dispensaries\nthis opens it up so that they can have\nan extra Dispensary on the location of\nthe grow processing center\nsomething that if you go to other states\nthat some of me we visited several years\nago there was always a dispensary that\nwas Affiliated in a separate building\nattached to the grow processing center\nso that makes it a little bit more\napplicable as far as dispensing these\nmedicines\nif you'll look at the bottom of section\nthree\nthis would allow dispensaries to also\nsell the product of the other\ndispensaries in the other drawer and the\ndistillers of this oil\nwhat that does is this thing is becoming\nmore and more specialized every year\nwe have had interviews with different\ncompanies and that now certain Growers\nthey're perfecting through their\nbiological sciences in the agricultural\nsciences that they're they're blending\nand they're doing a lot of things with\ncannabis oil to narrow in on specific\ndiseases\nspecific diseases so basically One\ncommercial operation may not have the\nparticular oil of medicine that would\nsatisfy one but it would satisfy this\nall but they can sell from other\ndispensaries\nif you look at the top of section four\nThis spells out clearly that personal\ninformation that information that they\nmay have about\nCannabis cards or Physicians information\nand all that and trade secrets are not\nthat they are that is not opened and not\nsubject to open records for the obvious\nreason that a patient's personal\ninformation or Trade Secrets should be\nsection five and six oh this is a little\ncomplicated but I'm going to give you\nthis information as in tandem\nright now there's nine protests you have\ntwo class ones that's been issued you've\ngot four tentatively uh that will be\nissued and you've got nine protesters\nthis will allow the Cannabis Commission\nto issue up to nine more licenses no\nmore than a total of 15 total but that\nwould give them the latitude to do what\nthey need to do I've been asked the\nquestion does this guarantee that the\nprotesters will get a license no it\ndoesn't\nthis gives a cannabis commission the\nauthority to do it if they so wish so\nthat then itself might be a step forward\nto solving this dilemma\nsection 7\nputs a commission again under the open\nrecords law and it eliminates any\nsecrecy of any of their activities\nSection 8 it creates a future path\nsomething that I had talked to some of\nthe leadership that they had brought up\nto me that at some point it needs to be\na future path for more of these\ndistilleries or the growing operations\nor whatever you wish to call them and\nthat's the the system in here that for\nevery 5 000 patients that are prescribed\nthe low THC oil on the registry there\ncould be a Class 2 license issue if\nthere's ten thousand more there could be\na class one and again that would be at\nthe discretion of the Cannabis\nCommission\nsection 8.\nnine and ten this deals specifically\nwith Georgia Statewide business courts\nto say that they will have jurisdiction\nexclusive jurisdiction over appeals and\nany grievances that may be filed and\nthat's in section 9 10 and 11. number 12\nsomething that I truly believe should\nhave been put into the original bill\nthis is a financial disclosure this says\nthat each member of the commission shall\nfile an annual Financial disclosure\nstatement with the office of the\nInspector General no later than July the\nfirst of each year\nthis is just a little bit of good\ngovernment ladies and gentlemen\nand then last but not least in section\n13\n. uh there's about two or two dozen\nillnesses that are defined in a law that\nwould be acceptable to get a cannabis\ncard this adds two more that the\nCommittees himself uh ulcerative Goliath\ncolitis that was a product of the former\nrepresentative Mike wolinski last year\nand my stevia\ngravis whatever that may be and but I\nhave no idea that the committee knew\nfrom whence they worked on that that is\nsomething that probably needed to be\nadded that ladies and gentlemen is a\nbill\nI would give us I would give a footnote\nto this\nI had said in the committee that this is\nabout money and it is about money we saw\nwho the lobbyists were hired we saw all\nof these folks\nuh because of the process and what\nhappened in the process\nand a lot of that in my opinion was\nstrictly due to no open records and no\nadministrative procedures Act\nthat there were errors there were some\nmajor heirs both in the grading of how\nthings were graded and things such as\nthat\nbut it's time for us to move on\nthis isn't about us this is about the\npeople of Georgia\nI remember what got me actively involved\nin this several years ago when I made\nthe comment from this very well\ndid anything that God lets grow\nnaturally has got to be better in\nsomething manufactured in a laboratory\nand if you don't believe that you hadn't\nseen how many folks are addicted to\nprescription drugs\nI saw these children that came to this\nCapitol\nI have a personal stake in this not a\nfamily member but the friends of a\nfamily member that I that I grew up with\nthese folks they had a grandchild that\nwas born 12 years ago with severe\nseizures\nthat child had seizures every 30 seconds\nand because of that was has never been\nable to develop\nthat child is 12 years old now\nbut after this cannabis oil was\nrecommended to that family\nthe mother had to move out of the state\nluckily the family had resources that\nwere available and the mother moved out\nof the state took an apartment in\nColorado\nto provide the medicine for that child\nladies and gentlemen that's a shame and\nit's a disgrace\nit's a shame and a disgrace that we\npassed an issue forward and foul\nbureaucracy did not move it forward but\nthat's over and done that's not an issue\ntoday the issue today before you today\nis let's fix this system let's get it\nmoving let's go forward and with that Mr\nSpeaker I'll be glad to yield

part\none of the bill\ndeals with the Georgia or rural Hospital\ntax credit Georgia heart program makes a\ncouple of changes to that program with\nsome definitions of of what those\nhospitals are\nthe biggest changes is it changes the\naggregate amount of tax credit that\nallowed from 75 million dollars to 80\nmillion dollars and it increases the\namount uh that a pass-through entity can\ncontribute per year from ten thousand\ntwenty five thousand uh it also extends\nthe sunset uh to December 31st of 2028.\npart two deals with the student\nscholarship organizations the

recognized\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield I do\nI guess I've received a number of calls\nregarding the increase in the money for\nstudent scholarships by 10 million\ndollars\nI believe is that the program that takes\npublic money and and allows it to be\nredirected to private schools\nno sir what it does is it allows\nsomebody to take their tax liability and\ndonate it to the organization of their\nchoice much like the rural Hospital tax\ncredits due and the Georgia Peach\nprogram does so they can they can choose\nto uh pay their tax liability their\nstate tax liability to those\norganizations or their Habitat for\nHumanity or the peach program or the\nrural Hospital program does the\ngentleman further yield for one more\nquestion I do\nso in essence my for

received\nhundreds of millions of dollars since it\nwas first created in 2008 and has fallen\nshort of serving the state's\neconomically disadvantaged children as\nrevealed by a review of State records\nthat found the tax credit favors\nchildren from middle class and wealthier\nfamilies over those from low-income\nbackgrounds\nat the same time on lines 346 the bill\nprovides that tax credits

this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nlet's give the dean of the Chatham\nCounty delegation the honor and respect\nhe deserves when he presents a bill\nchairman Stevens is recognized to\npresent the bill\nJeremy Stevens\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen the house you might recall\nthis bill for Pas and the physician\nassistants and aprns to prescribe class\nII narcotics on a very limited basis as\nHouse Bill 369 which passed out of this\nbody overwhelmingly 143-12 a couple of\nyears ago what this bill seeks to do is\nin an emergency situation that allows\naprns and PAs to write to write a\nfive-day supply of emergency\nprescriptions of Class 2 stimulants and\nif you're over 18 a hydrocodone compound\nproducts it requires AP aprns and PAs to\nhave at least one year of post\nlicensing experience they've got to work\nfrom Clinical experience before they're\nallowed to do this it requires aprns to\nhave a protocol agreement Which\nauthorized from an authorizing physician\nto allow them to do it and it requires\nPAs to have a job description on file\nwith that position\nit requires aprns and PAs to both have\none hour of continuing education and it\nseeks to streamline some of the\nprocedures and requirements of the\ncomposite Medical Board ladies and\ngentlemen the only other state besides\nGeorgia that does not allow this is\nOklahoma\nthe alt for aprns the only other state\nthat doesn't allow this for Pas is\nKentucky\nnow I don't know about you but I trust\nmy physician and the and if you're in\nrural Georgia this is your health care\nis your PA and your APR in\nMr Speaker that's the essence of the\nbill and I'll take any questions\na gentleman has no questions good I\nyield a well thank you for your\nconsideration the chairman has yielded\nthe well we do have a speaker on the\nmeasure representative owl is recognized\nfor\nher time in the well\nthank you Mr Speaker so I Rise to speak\nagainst HB 557 let me first make clear\nwhat these remarks are not okay these\nare not remarks designed\nto impugn the clinical skill or the\ntraining of physician Assistance or\nadvanced practice nurses I work very\nclosely with many Pas and aprns and not\nonly do I consider them some of my\nclosest friends I respect them and I\nwould trust them to care for my own\nchildren\nthese are also not remarks meant to\nminimize the health care Workforce\nshortages we face right particularly in\nour underserved under-resourced rural\ncommunities these problems are real and\nthey do need to be addressed\nbut the last thing Georgia needs In This\nMoment is more people writing\nprescriptions for opioids\nas a nation we're suffering an\nunprecedented epidemic of opioid\naddiction and Georgia has been hit hard\nin fact what we've seen is that we've\nhad more than a 60 rise in opioid deaths\nin the past two years of recorded data\nand in the medical community we know\nthat some of this addiction has in fact\nbeen seated by a cultural ease in the\nmedical community to write prescriptions\nfor opioid-based pain medications okay\nresearch shows that even just a\nthree-day course of opioids can increase\nthe risk of opioid addiction even a year\nout from that initial encounter and what\nwe're seeing in the medical community\nis that we really have to come to terms\nwith our role in ceding this addiction\nbecause\nI know the easiest thing in the world to\ndo is to write someone for a\nprescription and when we increase the\nnumber of people who can prescribe\nopioids we will increase the number of\nopioids being prescribed\nthe ability to write or refill opioid\nprescriptions should not be conflated\nwith health care\nso I deeply respect the sponsor of this\nbill I really like working with him I\nrespect his intentions in bringing this\nbill but I believe it does our patients\na real disservice that goes far beyond\nthe issues of Workforce or of\nconvenience\nwe do have a larger duty to protect in\nthis body and I therefore ask you that\nyou vote no on this bill and I'm happy\nto stand for any questions\nthe lady has no questions\nwell excuse me one did come up if you'll\nyield\nto your left\nrepresentative Mary Frances Williams to\nyour extreme left\nDr oh I say this with a uh does the lady\nyield I do I say this was the greatest\nrespect but considering that we are one\nof\nonly two states that's not doing this do\nyou do you think that\nour opioid\naddiction rates are that much out of\nline with all these other states\nwell I think we're talking about two\ndifferent things the fact that many\nother states do allow this profligacy of\nopioid prescriptions\nis related I think to the fact that we\ndo have a national opioid epidemic right\nalso I don't think if everyone else\njumps off a bridge that we should also\ndoes the lady further yield I do\num\nisn't it true that the this is a\nthis has to be this is done by an APRN\nand it has to be under the supervision\nof a doctor\nthat is true however what I will note is\nthat oftentimes when we use uh physician\nextenders or sometimes we call them it\nis to handle a large volume of patients\nright and as I noted sometimes the\neasiest thing in the world to do is to\nwrite a prescription because we feel\nthat we are serving a purpose and it's\nwhat the patient wants\nbut that actually does tend to feed in\nto an ease of writing more opioid\nprescriptions I will note there was\nactually a study that came out in a\nmedical journal somewhat recently that\nshowed that while the median ease of\nwriting prescriptions between Physicians\nand aprns was roughly the same however\nthat mid-level practitioners like Pas\nand aprns had more outliers in terms of\nbeing much more quick or loose to write\nthese opioid prescriptions because it's\nit's very easy to do it right and then\nyou've stopped getting the calls one one\nmore question please certainly so we're\nnot just talking about opioids though\naren't we aren't we also talking about\num ADHD drugs and I I thought this was\nonly for emergency situations this isn't\njust any any uh nurse in any doctor's\noffice writing prescriptions all day\nlong it's in an emergency situation\nunder a doctor's Supervision in an\nemergency situation\nyou are correct in that this does\ninclude stimulants such as adderall\nwhich is written for aadhd these are\nschedule 2 drugs which do include opioid\nmedications but I will note again that\nit allows for a five day up to a\nfive-day prescription of these\ncontrolled substances and even a\nthree-day prescription has been shown to\nincrease the risk of addiction for up to\na year out so it's just about increasing\nthat interface for patients having an\nincreased ease of getting an opioid\nprescription and having people who are\nmaybe more motivated to write these\nprescriptions being able to do so\nlater year for one more question\nabsolutely chairman sayings to your left\ndo you yield for a question I do is it\nnot true that even though you may call\nthese individuals physician extenders\nthat Physicians physician assistants and\nnurse practitioners are the individuals\nwho give most of Georgia access to\nnecessary Medical Care and that this\nbill will further citizens in this\nstate's ability to get needed in crucial\ncare\nthank you for that question I want to\nre-emphasize that I work very closely\nwith Pas and aprns every single day that\nI'm at work so this is not meant to\nimpugn their skill or their value to the\nmedical community right my point simply\nis that it increases the ease with which\npatients can get opioid medications and\nwe have seen historically that this has\nled to a blooming of the opioid epidemic\nin this country so this is purely a\npatient safety issue\nlady has no further questions\nlady has yielded the well is there any\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered the chair hears none the\nprevious question is ordered is there\nany objection to adopting the\ncommittee's substitute the chair here\nhas done the committee's committee\nsubstitute is adopted is there any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill the chair hears none\nthe report of the committee is agreed to\nshall this bill now pass all in favor of\nthe passage of the bill we'll vote Yes\nall those opposed will vote no and the\nclerk will unlock the machine\nfor what purpose does representative\nsharp arise a parliamentary inquiry\nState your inquiry is it true that I've\nbeen in the medical field over 30 years\nas a paramedic working with some of the\ngreat Pas and aprns here in Georgia and\nthat we really really need this service\nand we got to also understand that this\nis still under a medical director's\nprotocol and that they will be able to\ndo this just for a short term and I\nthink that we should support this bill\nbecause we need it especially in rural\nGeorgia we need this so if you guys just\nsupport us on it I appreciate it\nI'm sure the gentleman\nknows of what he speaks is very\npassionate about it\nin his profession\nfor what purpose does represent aisle\nrise parliamentary inquiry States your\ninquiry is it not true that we should\nnot conflate the ease of writing opioid\nand Controlled Substances with Health\nCare at Large\nI'm sure the lady believes exactly what\nshe says\none more\nfor what purpose this\nrepresentative Roman rise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry\nthank you Mr Speaker is it not true that\nafter a severe infection I was\nprescribed oxy and after three days I\nalmost became addicted to it and had it\nnot been for a doctor who knew how to\nsupport me through that I probably would\nnot be here today\nI'm sure the lady knows of what she\nspeaks and we're so glad she's well and\ndoing great great representative\nis there any objection to the excuse me\nI think we passed that point\nhave all members now voted\nhave all members voted if so the clerk\nwill lock the machine on the passage of\nthe bill the yeas\nwere\n136 the Nays 38 the bill haven't\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed\nMr clerk will you read the caption to\nhouse bill 33-0\nHouse Bill 30 by representative Carson\nthe 46 to be titled neck to amend\nchapter one and title 50 the official go\nto Georgia annotated relating the\ngeneral Provisions relative to state\ngovernment so as to provide for the\ndefinition of anti-semitism\nthis bill I haven't referred to the\ncommittee on Judiciary that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby committee substitute\nthe gentleman from Cobb County rep\nchairman John Carson is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nfolks I Rise to ask you to support house\nbill 30. this is effectively the same\nbill that we pass as House Bill 1274\nlast year\n141-19 overwhelmingly bipartisan in this\nhouse last year what this bill does is\ncodifies a definition of anti-semitism\nas adopted by the international\nHolocaust remembrance Alliance or IRA\nsuch that anti-Semitism is a certain\nperception of Jews which may be\nexpressed as hatred toward Jews\nrhetorical or and excuse me rhetorical\nand physical manifestation\nmanifestations of anti-Semitism are\ndirected toward Jewish or non-jewish\nindividuals and their property\ntoward Jewish Community institutions and\nreligious facilities what this basically\ndoes is ensure that when analyzing\nintent behind discriminatory actions\nthat Target Jewish people\nwhether it's hate crime or illegal\ndiscriminatory actions that there is an\nallegation that the action was motivated\nby anti-jewish sentiment the relevant\nauthorities consider as rebuttable\nevidence the world's most accepted\ndefinition of anti-semitism this\ndefinition is adopted by about 1100\ndifferent separate governments ngos this\nsame legislation has been passed by\nStatute in Six States including Arizona\nIowa Tennessee most recently Arkansas\nseveral other states by executive order\nand 22 by resolution\nI want you to make clear that this bill\ndoes not limit Free Speech we've\ndiscussed that at length in chairman\ngutter's uh house Judiciary Committee\nI would point you to lines 30 through 35\nnoting that nothing into this bill\ninfringes upon the First Amendment\nthis bill is necessary why are we doing\nthis I know everybody saw the news\ncoverage and some of you experienced\nthe anti-semitic Flyers that were handed\nthat were thrown in driveways just very\nhateful uh Flyers that were handed out\nin driveways earlier this year\nanti-semitic incidents are on the rise\nand they keep Rising the Jewish people\nmake up less than two percent of the\nstate of Georgia beget prop\napproximately 60 percent or more of all\nthe hate crimes are our Target against\nJews and Jewish facilities\ngroups in support of this I we have a\nnumber of friends here in the gallery or\nat least I hope we do\nwe we have a number of people if you\ndon't mind standing just one up by one\nuh silently for us Dove wilker Regional\ndirector for the American Jewish\ncommittee\nCheryl darcinski executive director of\nthe Atlanta Israel coalition\nMark goldsfetter general counsel for\nhillels of Georgia\nEric Robbins president CEO of the Jewish\nFederation of Atlanta It's on Davidson\nRegional director of the Anti-Defamation\nLeague\nRegional director of the Israeli\nAmerican Council Renee Evans Israel\nadvocate\nLeslie Anderson executive director of\nthe Jewish community relations Council\nand Harold Kurtz president that of the\nJewish community relations Council and\nwe also have support from other groups\nsuch as Hadassah Greater Atlanta\nNational Jewish Advocacy Center National\nCouncil for Jewish women on and on but I\ngot to tell you colleagues what what I\nkeep hearing more and more is why am I\nhearing so much opposition to this bill\nfrom Jews\nand let me tell you\nin just a moment you're going to hear\nfrom the only Jewish lawmaker in support\nof this bill but I will tell you this\nthere is a loud group\nof quote unquote Jews that are opposing\nthis because they support Palestine they\ndo not support Israel and the in the\nJewish people\nyou might have some items on your desk\nI left a letter both Esther and I\nleft a letter of support from all of\nthese groups which again represent over\n90 95 percent of the Jews in Georgia\nthese are the people\nto which we're trying to protect really\njust all Jews but the 90 95 of them are\nin support of this measure and so you're\nsaying who are these groups that are\nspeaking against\none group is called Jewish voice for\npeace jvp and I'll read this this is\nstraight off the Anti-Defamation League\nwebsite\nthe Jewish voice for peace jvp is a\nradical anti-israel anti-zionist\nactivist group that advocates for the\nboycott of Israel and eradication of\nZionism\nyou might have heard of the Union of\nReform uh Judaism that they're against\nthis\nhere's another article reform Jewish\ninstitutions affirm Ira working\ndefinition of anti-semitism and on page\ntwo of their online article\nthe bottom line is is we endorse the IRA\ndefinition is a powerful tool serving\nthe cause of combating anti-Semitism\nbests when those standards are\nmaintained and the definition is used to\nstrengthen efforts to enforce and\nenhance America's existing anti-hate\ncrime laws\nyou know folks people ask me you know\nJohn you go to a Baptist Church in Cobb\nCounty why do you support this why are\nyou fighting so hard I'm fighting\nbecause there's not enough people\nfighting for the Jewish people\nmy the the word of God in Genesis in\nchapter 12 the Lord says to Abram I will\nbless those that bless Israel and I will\ncurse those that curse Israel\nthat's why I do this\nMr Speaker I know I've gone on this is\neffectively the same bill as Lee had\nlast year\nand I'll take a question if not\nif there is one I will yield if there is\nnot I will yield it will you do have a\nquestion yes sir I'll take one\nrepresentative Ada and Sonia has a\nquestion for you he's over to your left\nthank you Mr Speaker would a gentleman\nyield yes\nis it not true that the main group that\nTarget the Jewish community and uses\nanti-semitic slurs at Jews or white\nnationalists in white supremacy group\nthat is my understanding as well sir and\nI do ask for your favorable\nconsideration on this with that Mr\nSpeaker I know the hour is late the time\nis short and I'm going to yield the well\nMr Speaker\nthe gentleman has yielded the well we\nhave a couple of speakers on this bill\nwe'll start with representing Jasmine\nClark who wishes to speak to the issue\nrepresentative Clark\nif the lady will suspend just for a\nmoment we allocated time on these bills\nthere are two folks signed up to speak\nin favor and two opposed they will have\n30 minutes each to be divided amongst\nthemselves if they wish to take that\nlong representative Jasmine Clark is\nrecognized\ntoday I rise in opposition to hb30\nbut before I go any further I want to be\nexplicitly clear\nthere is no place for hate and our\nbeautiful diverse state of Georgia\nthere is absolutely positively never any\nexcuse for anti-semitism\nnone whatsoever\nand when a person commits a crime\nagainst another person because that\nperson is Jewish they should face stiff\npenalty\nthat is why I am extremely proud that I\nvoted yes for House Bill 426 in 2020.\nfor those of you who aren't here in 2020\nthat is the hate crimes bill\nif I were given the opportunity to vote\non HB 426 again I would vote Yes again\nand again and again\nbut today I am opposed to hb30 not\nbecause I don't believe that we that\nacts of anti-Semitism need to be\npunished\nbut because I\ntoday I'm opposed because when this\nworking definition was constructed on\nMay 26 of 2016.\ntheir intentions and their own words\nwas to adopt the following\nnon-legally binding working definition\nnon-legally binding\nnon-legally binding\nwhy are we legally binding something\nthat was not meant to be so\nif someone were to hand me a jug of\nwater labeled not for human consumption\nwhat I'm not going to do is pull out a\nbunch of Cups and pour it for everyone\nto drink\nI do believe that anti-semitic acts are\ncovered under the current hate crime\nstatute this increases the penalties if\na person selected their victims based on\nrace\ncolor\nreligion national origin sex sexual\norientation gender mental disability or\nphysical disability\nbut by creating a definition for\nanti-Semitism when anti-semitic acts are\nalready covered in statute it begs the\nquestion as to why the Georgia Code does\nnot define\nanti-black racism\nor anti-latino racism or anti-asian\nracism\neach of these groups could make the\nargument that they have been subjected\nto an increase in acts of violence over\nthe years\nand while I certainly do not believe in\npartaking in oppression Olympics\nI do believe that a bill such as this\nmay unintentionally have the effect of\nhaving each\nmarginalized group\nwondering where is their definition in\nthe code\nso I'm going to close\nbecause the hour is kind of late I know\nsome people are hungry\nI want to talk about consensus\nI'm not Jewish I don't purport to be\nJewish and so when making decisions that\ncome to the Jewish Community I wanted to\nmake sure that Jewish voices were\nAmplified\nI will not go so far as to qualify who\nis Jewish or who is quote unquote Jewish\nwhat I will say is that I received\napproximately an equal number of emails\nin favor of this bill\nand opposed to this bill\nthat told me that there is not consensus\non this matter of this specific\ndefinition being codified in Georgia\nI say that to say that just because I\nvote no on this bill does not mean I am\nmaking a vote against Jewish people\nI support the Jewish community\nhowever I also oppose referencing\nnon-legally binding working definitions\nin Georgia code\nthose two are not mutually exclusive\nand with that Mr Speaker I will yield\nthe well\nlady has yielded the well representing\nHolly is recognized to speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nfortunately\nI have the privilege of being\na former resident of one of our\ncolleagues\nwho\na resident in the formerly resident in\nthe district which is now represented by\none of our colleagues who was a\nrecipient of some very hateful\num\nhorrible\ndissemination\nof speech\nthat was against her it was against her\npeople\nI don't believe that in any instance we\nshould have\nour members of our community subjected\nto such hate\nhowever I realized that\none of the best things that we can do\nin the face of hate\nis to speak out\nis to speak in love to speak in a manner\nthat addresses the wrong\nin the end we will remember the words of\nour enemies but the Silence of our\nfriends\nthese words by Reverend Dr Martin Luther\nKing Jr place a moral obligation on each\nof us to condemn\nactions like these anti-semitic Flyers\nas a Young Man growing up in that area\nI know that diversity is welcomed by all\nespecially among my Jewish friends who\nI've had the privilege the privilege of\nbeing able to have over the last 34\nyears\nhe persists because of Silence\nin 2021\nwhen a North Georgia congresswoman who\nwill not be named\nshared an anti-semitic conspiracy theory\nabout space lasers\nour body was largely silent\nbecause she's in Congress and we're in\nthe State House many of us incorrectly\nassumed that it was not our place to\nspeak up\nbut as we have learned from our drum\nmajor of Justice it is always the right\ntime and place to speak out against\nInjustice and hatred\nwe must not support a law\nthat seeks to criminalize the freedom of\nspeech and I know what it says\nbut if you look at the ihra's definition\nit is very clear that it equates\nthe hate against Jewish people with\nsharp criticism of the state of Israel\nas a political government\ndespite its good intentions that is\nexactly what iohra's definition of\nanti-semitism does\nit seeks to fight anti-Semitism by\nprohibiting the criticism of a political\ngovernment\nif you decide to adopt that ihra\ndefinition of anti-semitism\nand you make it illegal to criticize the\npolitical government of Israel\nhow far will you go to police our words\nperhaps anyone using the n-word past or\npresent can be charged with a hate crime\nperhaps anyone who condemns critical\nrace Theory should be charged with a\ncrime perhaps anyone who says they\noppose gun restrictions even after a\nmass shooting\ncan be charged with a crime\nit would be irresponsible to offer\ncriticism without offering an\nalternative\nand that's why accordingly I propose we\nadopt the Jerusalem Declaration on\nanti-Semitism that has been signed by\n350 Jewish Scholars around the world\nthe Jerusalem declaration lists 15\nguidelines by identifying anti-semitism\nit allows us to Monitor and to combat\nanti-Semitism head-on while still\nallowing legitimate political criticism\nof the current Israeli government\nwe can add and we will defeat\nanti-Semitism here in Georgia\nmy fellow Democrats and Republicans our\nvoices will unite to speak against hate\njust as we did when we passed the hate\ncrimes legislation previously\nbut our voices will not be heard without\nfully exercises and freedom of speech\nthat is defined more accurately by the\nJerusalem Declaration on anti-semitism\nwe must preserve our American values and\nvote no on this definition of that is\nprovided by the ihra\nbut I leave you with this message of\nHope\nwe have the opportunity to move beyond\nwords\nand put our fight against anti-Semitism\ninto action and so therefore I hope that\nyou join me today in accepting a better\ndefinition through the Jerusalem\nDeclaration on anti-Semitism and voting\nno against this\nmeasure again\nwe stand in support of the Jewish people\nbut we can be critical of a government\nwithout making any of those remarks\nagainst the people who are themselves\nour fellow Americans and with that I\nyield the will\ngentlemen has yielded the well\nmembers give your attention to the lady\nthat's entering the well\nmembers\nsees conversations\nrepresentative pennich is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nhmm\ncolleagues friends\ntoday I stand before you as the only\nelected Jewish official in this chamber\nasking you to pass\nHB 30.\nlegislation that I had never imagined\nwould be necessary in Georgia in the\n21st century\nsadly this bill is needed that the\nJewish Community which includes my\nhusband my children the men and women\nthat I worship with have these same\nprotections granted to every other\nreligious group in Georgia\ndoing so does not the advance the cause\nof any group it simply ensures\nprotection\nnor does it impinge on the rights or\ninterests of any other group\nprotections for Jewish people do not\ncome at the expense of anyone else\nexcept anti-semites\nthe ways in which hate has been brought\nagainst the Jewish people are plentiful\nthroughout the ages\nbut I don't have to reach across the\nocean or back into history\nmany of you are aware of the hateful\nFlyers that were distributed in heavily\nJewish neighborhoods against Metro\nAtlanta just a few weeks ago\nchildren who went out to play in their\ndriveways on Sunday morning picked up\nbaggies of hate and asked the questions\nto their parents what is this\nand just over a week ago various\nNeo-Nazi and white supremacists\nproclaimed a day of hate for the Sabbath\nintending to disrupt worship across the\ncountry\nand synagogues across the country braced\nfor attacks\nwe are grateful at least in Georgia\nneighbors and law enforcement stood by\nus and these plans did not come to\nfruition\nbut others were not so lucky\njust this week in Los Angeles or two\nweeks ago in Los Angeles two Jews were\nleft were shot leaving their synagogue\nby a gunman who blamed the Jews for his\nflunking out of dental school\nthat man is a member of the same group\nthat left the flyers on my driveway\nhb30 would not stop those flyers from\nbeing spread but would make sure that\nGod forbid if someone shot a Jew they\ncould be used as evidence of their\nmotive\nI want to be clear about something\nbecause it was brought up and it's\nincorrect when this says this is a\nlegally binding definition if you just\nread the bill it actually says lines 14\nanti-Semitism has the same meaning as\nprovided for in The Advisory definition\nof anti-semitism this definition is used\nto discern intent by a prosecutor or\ninvestigator only after an act of a\ncriminal act or unlawful discrimination\nhas already occurred\nplease understand that\nand it's not that difficult if you read\nthe bill\nin recent years in Pittsburgh in\nColleyville Texas men came into\nsynagogues with their Grievances and\ntheir guns\nin one case 11 worshipers were murdered\nin another a brave Rabbi and congregants\nwere able to overpower their attacker\nunder these circumstances a bill of this\ntype should be uncontested\nit gives our legal system a clear\ndefinition of anti-semitism so that\nexisting anti-discrimination laws our\nown hate crime law can be applied with\nthe most acceptable definition\njust to be clear be just because they\nhate crime law says it's against\nreligion does not mean a swastika would\nbe considered anti-Semitic\na swastika does not go against my\nreligion there is nothing in the Torah\nabout a swastika\nyou need a definition\nto be able to say that a swastika is\nanti-Semitic it's as simple as that\nthings that you would think would be\nobvious are not obvious and I'll get to\nan example in a moment but that is all\nthis is and it has been twisted and\ncontorted into making something it's not\nand I don't know why\nthis should be obvious that calling for\nthe killing or harm of a particular\ngroup is wrong even if they are Jews\nthat blaming all members of a group for\nreal or imagine wrongdoing committed by\na single member of that group is wrong\neven if they are Jews\nthe path of this bill has been torturous\nsome claims that you have heard have\nbeen that it might stifle speech or that\na definition of anti-semitism that\nincludes any mention of Israel for use\nin assessing intent as part of the hate\ncrime conflates two different issues\nunfortunately those who traffic and hate\nhave already scrambled that egg and I'm\nsorry to say that some of my colleagues\nhave been caught up in that\nand this bill is our state's best\nopportunity to restore the distinction\nbetween the criticism of Israel which is\ncompletely Justified and allowed\nand hatred of Jews which is a wall that\nhas been slowly chipped away\nthe definition literally says that\ncriticism of Israel like any other\ncountry is not anti-Semitic\nmore importantly this bill does not use\na definition to deal with any speech at\nall again it's only triggered by\nunlawful action\nour state should not and could not pass\na law prohibiting criticism of Israel\nbut in the last decade it has become all\nthe more common for hatred of Israel to\nspill over into hateful language\ndiscrimination or violence against Jews\nand that's what the opponents of hb30\nwant cover to be able to do and I will\nnot give that to them and neither should\nthis body\nin May 2021 when conflict ranged between\nIsraelis and Palestinians a group of men\ndrove to a predominantly Jewish\nneighborhood in Los Angeles and\nassaulted seven diners at a sushi\nrestaurant shouting free Palestine and\ndeath to Jews the diners were not\nIsraelis they were Americans\njust last week prosecutors in New York\nCity found that a pro-palestinian\nactivist went looking to beat Jews at a\npro-israel rally\nwell last week in an act of solidarity a\ncolleague the gentlewoman from the 89th\nintroduced her own bill against\nanti-Semitism something that I\npersonally wouldn't do to somebody of a\nmarginalized Community if I wasn't a\nmember of that community\nnonetheless our bill hb30 does not\ninclude a finding section but her bill\ndoes and I have put it up there I agree\nwith every word in the section I want to\nread it to you for the record because it\napplies equally to hb30\nthe section reads and we only had one\npage up so I'm going to read before it\nanti-Semitism including harassment on\nthe basis of actual or perceived origin\nancestry ethnicity identity affiliation\nor faith remains a persistent pervasive\nand disturbing problem in Contemporary\nAmerican society\nJewish people continue to be a targeted\nminority in the United States\ndata show for instance that Jews are\nconsistently the most likely of all\nreligious groups to be victimized by\nincidents of hate and that such\nincidents are increasing at an alarming\nrate\nState officials and institutions have a\nresponsibility to protect citizens from\nacts of hate and bigotry moded by\ndiscriminatory animus including\nanti-Semitism and must be given the\ntools to do so\nvalid monitoring informed analysis and\ninvestigation and effective policy\nmaking require uniform definitions\nwhile there could be this is the\nimportant part where there could be no\nexhaustive definition of anti-semitism\nas it can take many forms the\ninternational Holocaust remembrance\nAlliance IRA\nworking definition which is the\ndefinition that both hb30 and\nrepresentative Becky Evans Bill used has\nbeen an essential definitional tool used\nto determine contemporary manifestations\nof anti-Semitism and include useful\nexamples of discriminatory anti-israel\nacts that can cross the line into\nanti-semitism\nI'll summarize the definition has been\nused by our federal government and over\n30 governments around the world\nrecommended for use by the European\nCouncil and the European Parliament\nendorsed by the Secretary General of the\nUN and of the uas policy guides over 11\nand 1100 organizations have approved it\nthank you to my colleague for your\nsupport of Ira I couldn't have said it\nbetter myself\nand just to put some meat on what was\nreferenced in IRA\nand why it's so important just this week\nan activist named Sada Masood pled\nguilty to conspiracy to commit the\ncrimes against Jews\nhis defense team argued in writing that\nhe had violently assaulted Jewish people\non at least three separate occasions\nbecause he disagreed with the political\nbeliefs about Israel\nbut in the sentencing submission\nprosecutors laid out the actual\nconversations he had with Associates\nabout how to evade law enforcement he\ntold them remember don't chant out chant\nout Jews it's the zionists to avoid\nallegation of anti-semitism\nin the words of prosecutors the veil of\nanti-zionism is pathetically thin in\nthis case\nbut he tried it anyway in court that's\nwhy we need HB 30 and that's why the IR\nexamples of when allegedly anti-israel\nactions become anti-semitism\nfor a long time Georgians didn't have\nprotection Georgia was one of the last\nstates to pass a hate crimes Bill and it\ntook too long\nthe straw that broke the camel's back\nwas the horrific murder of Ahmad Arbury\nthree men targeted him solely because of\nthe color of his skin that's the essence\nof a hate crime\nthe victim's race religion or national\norigin is the reason for the crime\nviolence motivated by hate deserves\nspecial attention in our legal system\nbecause it is intentionally specifically\ntargeted at individuals because of their\npersonal immutable characteristics\nas a result these crimes are very\npersonal with extraordinary emotional\nand psychological impacts on the victim\nand their community\nso this is where we get to some of the\nevents that have eluded investigators\nwhich is why we need this definition\nthis happened in Fulton County Public\nSchools not far from here\nBeth gen a mother testified testified at\nthe house Judiciary Committee for what\nher sons went through until the\nDepartment of Education had to step in\nand threaten Fulton County\nfor over 18 months her sons were\nterrorized with anti-semitic symbols\nfinding swastikas on bathroom walls\ngraffiti stating graffiti stating Jew\nkilled the Jews gassed the Jews\nswastikas saying Hitler\nso during the Hitler's salute in class\nand screaming anti-semitic slurs it's an\nexperience that's still haunts them to\nthis day and they are still in therapy\nsince there was no definition they were\ngaslighted and told by numerous school\nofficials that what they were witnessing\nwas not anti-Semitism that it was not a\nswastika it was a symbol of peace\nand the graffiti was not anti-semitism\nin matters of law I know it when I see\nit is not sufficient\na recent study found that half of nearly\nhalf of all Americans say they do not\nknow what anti-Semitism is\nit is not in the interest of justice for\nall to provide it is in the interest of\nall of justice for all to provide\nClarity on the bright lines of what is\nand what is not\nracism against Jews to prevent racist\nacts from hiding behind the shield of\ngeopolitics and to assure that\nprosecutors are not tempted to overreach\nthis bill is not why I came to the\nlegislature I came to advocate for\nothers for the well-being of all people\nin my state but sometimes life puts us\nin a particular place at a particular\ntime\nif you have read the Bible\nand I know you have\ntoday you probably know the story of\nPurim\nthere is an attempt to wipe out the Jews\nfrom ancient Persia\nand a Jewish woman named Esther has\nfound her way into the palace and finds\nthe weight of her the lives of her\npeople on her shoulders\nshe wonders why me until her uncle\nMordechai tells her in chapter 4 verse\n14.\nfor if you remain silent at this time\nrelief and deliverance for the Jews will\narise from another place but you and\nyour father's family will perish and who\nknows but that you have come to your\nRoyal position for a Time such as this\nthe chaplain this morning said the same\nthing\nEsther takes these words to heart and\nconvinces the King to undo the evil plan\nhatched against her people\nthat story is taken as the Jewish\nholiday of Purim which is to be observed\ntonight in about an hour\nwhen my parents named me Esther they\ndidn't imagine me Walking The Halls of\nthe Georgia Capitol in the sandal steps\nof the first Esther\nbut perhaps like that first Esther it is\nfor this moment that I am here\nPurim is a celebratory holiday with\ncostumes cookies\nand a commandment to get drunk\nreally but I'm not going to celebrate\nuntil we're done here\nI'm here to remind us that when tyrants\nand bigots have Arisen through history\nthey start by targeting racial and\nreligious minority groups including Jews\nbut have rarely stopped there we have a\nchance to stop it here and now with our\nvotes thank you for your time I

the caption to House Bill\n364 364. House Bill 364 by\nrepresentative Holcomb the 81st to be\nentitled knack to a man Article 4\nchapter 5 of title 28. the official go\nto George annotated relating to the\nclaims Advisory board so as to create\nthe wrongful conviction compensation\nreview panel this bill ever referred to\nthe committee on Judiciary non-civil\nthat committee recommends that this bill\ndo pass\napply committee substitute\nand representing Scott Holcomb is\nrecognized to present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker it's my pleasure to\npresent to you house bill 364.\nwhat this will do is it will reform the\nway in which the state compensates the\nwrongly convicted what we're talking\nabout here are the truly innocent not\nthose who get off on a technicality or a\nprocedural issue but the truly innocent\nto have a process by which they can be\ncompensated for the time that they spent\nin jail in Georgia since 1989 47 people\nhave been exonerated as being innocent\nand they lost a total of 538 years those\nwere years that they were spent\nincarcerated away from their loved ones\naway from their ability to make a living\nand so this idea is to compensate these\nindividuals and to set forth a structure\nwhereby experts will make a\ndetermination of innocence and then make\na recommendation for compensation\nthere's been a lot of thought that's\nbeen put into this bill over the last\ncouple years and those of you that were\nhere last session it was House Bill 1354\nthat passed with overwhelming support\nthe makeup of the compensation panel is\nfound on page four\nand it would include a judge a retired\njudge or retired Justice a current\ndistrict attorney a criminal defense\nattorney and then individuals with real\nexpertise in forensics in the background\nalmost every\nindividual who has been exonerated it\nhas been due to DNA evidence\nhelping with that exoneration so this\nfor sets forth the process for that\num going forward I want to commend\nleader illustration he worked on this\nlast session and actually got the ball\nrolling and then we collaborated and\nthen I started working on it from that\npoint forward we've collaborated with\nthe various actors who would be involved\nthe prosecuting attorneys Council the\ndefense lawyers the Innocence Project\nafter innocence and they're all in\nsupport of what we're trying to do here\nand the bottom line is to take the\npolitics out of it my sense is shortly\nor this evening we will consider\nindividual resolutions some members have\nexpressed to me that is very difficult\nfor them to make those evaluations\nbecause they don't know enough about the\ncases so this will will put that\ndecision into a board that has\ntremendous skills knowledge and\nexpertise to make these decisions and\nthen it would go\nvia the courts since that is where this\nerror takes place it would be a\nrecommendation into their budget into\nthe the Judiciary Council so I'm happy\nto go into any specifics if anybody has\nany questions otherwise I will yield and\nask for your favorable consideration\nthank you\nyou have a couple of questions gentlemen\nyield yes sir I'll yield\nrepresentative Williams has a

one of these\ncompensation resolutions and I know how\ndifficult it was and has been and ones\nwe've had since then and uh isn't true\nthat since that time there have been\nsome improvements that actually now\nthere's a recommendation from a\ncommittee or some commission I can't\nremember the name of it that there is a\nrecommendation with a with a set uh\nrecommendation for a for an amount that\nwe didn't even have back then\nand isn't also true that I've changed my\nmind over the years and I completely\nagree with you and I appreciate you\nbringing this bill and I completely\nsupport you in it thank you sir thank\nyou\nrepresentative Fleming representing\nBarry Fleming is is recognized for a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker to the gym and the\nwell first of all isn't it true that I\nappreciate your attempt to work on what\nis generally a very difficult issue for\nus thank you for that\nuh but my question goes to this\nin the numerous years that you and I\nboth been here every time we pay\ncompensation this house appropriates\nthat by the individual vote on an\nindividual case isn't that true it is\nand under this system as I understand it\nand I stand to be corrected if I'm wrong\nbut under this new system that you're\nproposing these compensations will be\nwrapped into a general Appropriations\nbill and we will vote on her\nAppropriations Bill based upon what this\ncommittee has suggested not our\nindividual votes on each case is that\ncorrect that's correct okay thank you\nsir thank you\ngentleman yield for another question yes\nsir representative Roberts right out in\nfront of you to your list thank you Mr\nSpeaker this is the gentleman yield yes\nyes\num isn't it true that it does go through\nthe Appropriations process and that is\nthe one thing this body is required to\ndo so we don't risk these individual\nbills not making it through on Sony die\nwe know that these people will be\ncompensated who deserve to be\ncompensated and isn't it further true I\nreally appreciate this Bill thank you\nyes thank you and and my understanding\nis that this is the only\nthing that we do chairman Hatchet could\ncorrect me if I'm wrong that is separate\nfrom the budget where we have individual\nresolutions and so this would still have\nan oversight process but instead of\nhaving them as individual resolutions\nthey will go into the budget and and\nvery quick it's anecdotally but I think\nit's worthy of of mention\nlast year there were two resolutions\nthat we did\nchairman Hogan was the author of one and\nI was the author of the other\none of them was the second to last bill\nthat was called in the Senate\nat around 1208 1209 A.M\nand the one that I carried was the third\nto last at around 1208 and 1209 am\nthat's not how this process should

more bill\nbefore we go into recess Mr clerk will\nyou read the caption house bill 231-231\nhousehold 231 regression of Gullah to\nthe 19th be entitled an act to amend\narticle one of chapter 18 the title 15\nof the fish go to George annotated\nrelating to General Provisions regarding\nProsecuting attorneys so to create the\nprosecuting attorney's oversight\nCommission\nspillover for the committee on Judiciary\nnon-civil that committee recommends this\nbill do pass\nby committee substitute\nrepresentative gullet is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nHouse Bill 231 is a bill that we've\npassed three times in this house last\nyear and unfortunately uh the Senate\njust didn't get to it on Sani die from a\nconference committee report\nwhat this bill does is it tries to\naddress willful misconduct like sexual\nharassment misuse of funds as well as\npersistent and blanket refusal to\nprosecute cases based on political\nmotivations\na little bit about the bill first it\ncreates a prosecuting attorney's\noversight Council Commission\nit's a the commission is made up of a\nfive-member investigative panel and a\nthree-member hearing panel and all those\nare appointed by the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia\nthe investigative panel is responsible\nfor the investigative prosecutorial and\nadministrative functions of the\ncommission and the hearing panel is\nresponsible for\nadjudicating formal charges filed\nagainst the invest filed by the\ninvestigative panel issuing disciplinary\nand incapacency orders and issuing\nstandards of the commission\nwe've narrowed the scope the grounds for\nremoval for a district attorney or\nsolicitor general\nare mental and phys mental or physical\nincapacity interfering with the\nperformance of his or her duties which\nis or is likely to become permanent\nnumber two willful misconduct in office\nwillful and persistent failure to\nperform his or her duties as described\nby law\na conviction of a crime involving moral\nturpitude\nconduct prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice which brings\nthe office into disrepute\nintentionally instructing authorizing or\npermitting an assistant district\nattorney or assistant solicitor general\nor their staff to commit any act to\nconstituting grounds for removal\nor for violating the rules of the\nGeorgia Bar which include rule 3.8 which\ngoverns prosecutors in the state\nif a complaint is filed there must be a\nsworn affidavit detailing personal\nknowledge of the facts supporting the\ncomplaint\nall disciplinary action will be reviewed\nby the Supreme Court\nand additionally the bill adjusts the\nduties of the district attorney which is\nsection one and solicitors General\nSection 3 the bill to include reviewing\nevery case individually for which\nprobable cause exists in making\nprosecutorial decision based on that\ncase specific facts and circumstances\nagain this is something that we've\npassed three times this is an important\nbill to many of us in the state who've\ndealt with prosecutors who have torn our\ncommunities apart for instance I had a\nprosecutor in my county that repeatedly\nsexually arrests some of his staff\num not only did it play out into the\ncommunity people lost confidence in the\njudicial system of my County which is\nthe whole circuit my county is one\ncircuit we have a number of other\ndistrict attorneys or solicitors\ngenerals across the political Spectrum\nmine happen to be Republican there are\nRepublican problems and there are\nDemocrat problems and this is to address\nit it's a nonpartisan type of idea this\nis this is not a partisan issue in my\nmind regarding who's Who's acting in bad\nfaith as a D.A Bad actors out there but\nthis is vitally important to the\ncommunities who have District Attorneys\nwho are who are Bad actors and not\nProsecuting cases or uh\nor become doing things illegal and\nultimately just bringing really really\nbad light on their offices so with that\nMr Speaker I'm happy to answer any\nquestions\nyou have a couple of questions but we\nhave a lot of speakers I'll take two\nyou'll take two okay\nto your left representative Jasmine\nClark has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield I do so there are a lot of things\num that are in our code that are\nconsidered illegal for example adultery\nthings like that\ndoes this bill require that a prosecutor\nhas to to review and make a decision on\nevery single thing even some things that\nprosecutors might say it's not worth\ntheir time because they have a lot on\ntheir plates already yeah so what this\nbill will do require them to look at\neach case on a case-by-case basis it\ndoesn't require them to prosecute all\nthe cases it makes them look at each\ncase on this individual merits and\ndecide what they're going to do with it\nthere's a gentleman for the yield I do\nis that not what prosecutors do already\nno it's not what prosecutors some\nprosecutors do already I'm sure some do\nsome also issue blanket statements to\nsay anything in this world I'm not going\nto I'm not going to prosecute they don't\nlook at the merits of each individual\ncase today and that's a big reason why\nthis Bill's being brought forward\nthank you\nrepresentative Miller is recognized for\na question representative Tonya Miller\nto your left thank you Mr Speaker does\nthe gentleman yield I do\num can you please explain why your bill\ndoes not include the Attorney General as\nan elected D.A or prosecuting attorney\nwho could be brought before the\ncommission yeah so um what we're trying\nto do is focus on District Attorneys and\nsolicitor generals the Attorney General\nwas in the judicial system he has a\nchecks and balances um over there today\nprosecutors who have prosecutorial\ndiscretion on individual cases in our\ncircuits is what I'm trying to address\nhere does it do you further yield I do\num is it your belief that the Attorney\nGeneral does not do exactly what you\njust said and that is assessed cases on\nan individual basis to determine if\nthere's probable cause to move forward\nthe Attorney General does a lot of\ndifferent things including prosecute\nsome cases but primarily what we are\nfocused on is the individual cases in\nour circuits of judicial circuits on\nwhat they are for what they are focused\non so it's not an attorney general bill\nthis is a Prosecuting attorneys for\ndistrict attorneys and solicitor\ngenerals\nthank you thank you Mr Speaker I know\nthe hours late everyone wants dinner I\nknow there's some speakers so oh yeah\nthey will\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nrepresentative Kendrick is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nwe have\nsome folks signed up there's 30 minutes\nallocated to those opposed to the bill\nthen we have a Minority Report as well\nso there's three folks signed up three\nmembers signed up to speak opposed to\nthe bill so we will allocate the time\naccordingly that the speakers take\nthank you Mr Speaker\ngood morning or good afternoon\ncolleagues\ntoday I Rise to speak against house bill\n231.\nwhat I call the prosecutors overly\noversight bill\nwe have a great lineup of speakers that\nyou're going to hear from but this is my\none wish for all of you is that you\nlisten to the other side\nwe have a tendency to come to this floor\nwith pre-formed opinions as I do\nsometimes because it's Human Nature\nbut I ask that you forego going to the\nante room\nfour gold chatting it up with the\nlobbyists in the hallway for go\nnegotiating a bill on this floor because\nthis bill ladies and gentlemen is\nimportant to you and it's important to\nour communities\nlet's go back to what we learned in\nkindergarten which is there's a reason\nthat we have two ears and only one mouth\nand that is to listen to the other side\none of my favorite poets is Napoleon\nHill he wrote the book Think and Grow\nRich he published it in 1937 but he also\npublished another book one of my\nfavorite books in 1938 called outwitting\nthe devil\nbut it was so controversial that his\nfamily didn't publish it until 2011.\nand in this book he talks about the\nthree appetites that we must Crush so\nthat we don't become what he calls\nDrifters people who lack independent\nthought\nthe first one is an appetite for food\nI'm guilty of that one the second one is\nan appetite for sex and then the third\none is an appetite for uninformed\nopinions\nnow we're all entitled to our own\nopinions so if you listen to this lineup\nof speakers and you still vote yes\nthat's your prerogative we all have to\ndo what we need to do\nbut even though you are entitled to your\nown opinions ladies and gentlemen we are\nnot entitled to our own facts\nthe facts that you will hear today are\nthese number one we already have an\nexisting infrastructure with multiple\nways to do exactly what HB 231 seeks to\ndo\nthe second thing is that the fiscal note\nthat's attached to this bill is\ninadequate to handle what this bill is\npurporting to do you're going to need a\nlot more money\nthe third one is their prosecutorial\ndiscretion is vital to allowing our\nlocally elected DA's to examine the\nspecific facts of each case when\ndeciding if and how to prosecute and\nthat's threatened under this bill and\nlast the vast majority of DA's and the\nD.A Association oppose this bill\nI wonder does yours as well\nso the question I leave with you today\nis this will you actively listen today\nas to why you should vote no to this\nbill or will you leave with an\nuninformed opinion\nI hope that you choose the former before\ndeciding if HB 231 is good for our state\nthank you Mr Speaker and I yield the\nwill\nthe lady has yield yielded the well\nrepresenting Stacy Evans is recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen I rise in opposition to House\nBill 231 for one simple reason I believe\nin prosecutorial discretion\nand if you start trying to pick and\nchoose what da should be prosecuting or\nwhat they shouldn't based on the whims\nor the feelings of the day you are\ntrampling on prosecutorial discretion\nthere's just no way around it you either\nhave it or you don't\ndo I like everything that I'm seeing\nfrom Republican DA's in this state no of\ncourse I don't do I like everything I'm\nseeing from every Democratic D.A in this\nstate no\nI just came up here and asked you to\nvote on a compensation resolution for\nsomeone who was wrongfully convicted and\nhad to go through the exoneration\nprocess\nafter a case that in my belief should\nnever have been brought\nbut that was not my decision\nthat was up to the prosecute prosecutor\nto make those decisions\nnow that's not to say that we shouldn't\nthat da shouldn't be watched\nthey shouldn't be held accountable to\nanyone\nand they are\nthey are watched\na lot\nthey are accountable\nto the State Bar\nthey are accountable to the Attorney\nGeneral's office\nthey can be criminally prosecuted by\nthat office\nthey are accountable to us in the\nlegislature they can be impeached\nand most importantly they are\naccountable just like everyone in here\nto the voters\nthe voters get to decide who their DA's\nare and whether they think that that D.A\nis exercising his or her prosecutorial\ndiscretion correctly they can listen\nthey can see they can they can listen to\nour compensation resolution requests\nthey can read the paper they can hear\nhow many arrests are being made versus\nhow many convictions are being made and\nthey can decide is my D.A doing a good\njob or not that's not up to us\nnow I believe this legislation has come\nbefore us because there are some that\ndon't like what some democratic DA's are\ndoing across the state I think that's\nwhy we're here\nif you believe that too and you think\nthese Democratic DA's are going rogue\nI want to make sure\nthat you do not leave this room today\nand that you do not put your vote up on\nthat board before knowing this one thing\nit is not just Democratic DA's that pick\nand choose what cases they bring and\nwhat cases they prosecute every single\nD.A across the state does it\nand I tried to gather some data on this\nso that it wasn't just hey Stacy said\nthis\nI picked three of the most brick red\nareas in this state\nand I called those DA's and I said I\nwant a list of the cases that you know\nProst meaning you didn't prosecute them\nthat you just missed that you never\npresented to the grand jury\ncrickets\nI called and followed up I put my\nrequest in writing as an official\nrequest that led to me getting calls\nfrom two of those DA's\nwe can do it\nwe can give you the list\nbut it doesn't tell the whole story\nthere were very specific reasons why we\nmight have null crossed that or why we\ndid did a dismissal on this one or why\nwe never presented this one to the grand\njury Witnesses come and go testimony\nchanges\nthere's only so many hours in the day\nDA's have to allocate resources they\nmake those decisions and they're very\nindividualized\nI still don't have the list\nand I'm not going to tell you the DA's I\ncalled because I don't blame them\nI don't blame them for not wanting me to\nget that because it doesn't tell the\nwhole story how many cases get presented\nor don't does not tell us the story they\nwere elected to exercise their\nprosecutorial discretion and they should\nbe able to do that\nnewsflash hopefully it's apparent now\nevery time someone gets arrested does\nnot mean that that person ultimately\ngets to have their day in court or that\nthere's ever even anything presented to\nthe grand jury\nif you think that that's happening in\nbrick red counties\nyou're wrong if you think it's just in\nthese blue counties where not\neverybody's getting prosecuted I just\nwant to make sure you know that you're\nwrong\nnow\na lot of you on here might not like some\nof the things I do some of the bills I\nchoose to bring or the votes I choose to\nmake and I'm sure I feel the same way\nabout some of y'all\nI don't get to discipline you and you\ndon't get to discipline me why are we\ntreating DA's any differently I've heard\nfolks say well we've got a Judicial\nqualifications committee and we look\nspecially at the judges\nyou know why\nnot every judge is a lawyer did y'all\nknow that\nnot every judge is a lawyer so the State\nBar can't oversee all the judges we have\nto have a special oversight commission\nfor judges so that we can get them all\nunder the umbrella of somebody that's\nnot true for a D.A or a solicitor every\nsingle one of them has to be a lawyer\nthat means every single one of them is\nsubject to discipline from the State Bar\nof Georgia\nnow you can see in the bill the very\nbeginning of the bill there's a list of\nduties of the district attorneys\nand there's one that's added there\nif this was just about making sure that\nthe DA's are doing their job\ndoing their duties as we've listed them\nout in state law then why is that not\nthe list that you look at to decide\nwhether you're going to discipline a D.A\nor not\nlook a few pages back\nthe list for when you can discipline a\nDA when you can impeach them when you\ncan not impeach them when you can remove\nthem when you can involuntarily retire\nthem that's a whole different list\nhas nothing to do with that first list\nthat's the duties if this is just about\nthem doing their job why are those lists\nnot the same\nbecause that's not what this is about\nI want to leave you with an example of\nprosecutorial discretion and I'm not\nsaying anybody in this chamber has ever\nhad a situation like this but I kind of\nsuspect maybe you have\nring ring\nMr Miss D.A Mr Miss solicitor\nLittle Johnny's gotten in trouble\nthey found a little bag of weed in the\ncar\nhad a little bit too much to drink got\nbehind the wheel I think you could just\nput that in the drawer\nthat is now going to be a basis to\nremove somebody\nbecause the prosecutorial discretion was\nexercise and maybe this misguided youth\nwas put in a rehabilitation program or\nmaybe they were put on community service\nor maybe they're maybe they worked it\nout with their parents\nI'm also not saying that anybody in this\nroom is doing this but you know gambling\nis currently illegal in the state maybe\nwe can change part of that a little bit\nlater\nbut gambling's currently illegal\nI know that there are people in this\nchamber\nthat participate in some poker games\nthose don't get prosecuted\nwhat are we gonna do about that one of\nmy colleagues asked a question about\nadultery that's still illegal\nfornication illegal\nwhat are we going to do about the\nprosecutors that aren't Prosecuting\nthose crimes prosecutorial discretion\neither exists or it doesn't and I\nmaintain that it needs to remain in the\nstate and I ask you to please vote no on\nHouse Bill 231 and I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Yasmine Neal is\nrecognized to speak to the measure\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues I rise\ntoday to speak against house bill 231.\nI am going to be brief Swift I'm not\ngoing to be here to scream or shout I\njust want to talk to you for a little\nbit\nI want to speak to a specific aspect\nand that's using what we already have\nin committee the author alluded to the\nfact that there may have been some issue\nwith some being hesitant of using\ncertain measures we already have in\nplace to hold prosecutors accountable\nthe options are\nthe State Bar\narticles of impeachment\nvoters\nand the AG bringing charges\nspecifically a reference was made to the\nfact that the one option of bringing\narticles of impeachment before this body\nhasn't been done since the 1960s\nwhy is that\nif we have an issue that's at the level\nthat we claim to have in the state which\nwe can all acknowledge that there's an\nissue that the lady will suspend yes for\na moment\nthank you members that he will proceed\nthank you Mr Speaker\nso why hasn't it been used since the\n1960s we have a measure in place that we\ncan use but no one has started the\nimpeachment process to any of these\nprosecutors since the 1960s\nthis measure and the three other\nmeasures we have in place to remove\nprosecutors who are problematic\nalready are more than sufficient for\ngetting the desired solution to include\nremoval if necessary and we will not\nhave to spend additional money which\nthis bill will cause us to do\nwe should be careful of creating a new\nprocess with this bill when we haven't\neven exhausted all of the available\noptions we currently have available to\nus\noptions that may that my esteemed\ncolleagues will elaborate on here\nshortly but I know some in this body\nbelieve in smaller government and\ncost-saving measures\nand moving forward with this bill goes\nagainst those very Concepts that you and\nwe all hold dear to us\nso join me in voting no to this measure\nand with that Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell\nthe lady has yielded the well\nnow those in favor of the proposition\nwill have 30 minutes that will be\ndivided amongst themselves and we will\nbegin with representative Maynor\nspeaking speak in favor of the bill\nrepresentative Maynard\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthe Declaration of Independence says\ngovernments are instituted among men\nderiving their just powers from the\nconsent of the Govern\nthat whenever any form of government\nbecomes destructive of these ends it is\nthe right of the people to alter it\nit's everyone's right to petition the\ngovernment to redress their grievances\nin many instances across Georgia\nCitizens are deprived of their\nconstitutional right to redress their\ngrievances against prosecutors\nif the president of the United States\nmust obey the law and be subjected to\noversight it's a unfathomable to think a\nprosecutor should not\nthose that believe they don't need\noversight may be just the ones that need\nit\nhb231 brings attention to a serious\nproblem\nthis bill doesn't solve the multitude of\nproblems established by prosecutorial\nreform experts but it brings the\nsolution One Step Closer\njust as there are bad cops and\nexceptional cops there are corrupt\nprosecutors and outstanding prosecutors\nThe Fulton solicitor is amazing and\ndeserves an award for solicitor of the\nyear\nbut all prosecutors aren't objective and\nprioritize equal protections of the law\nit's too difficult to redress grievances\nwith the State Bar\nthe ag office says you have to file a\ncivil suit against the D.A because of\ntheir discretion\nthere is not one single member of this\nbody I'm sure that wants to bring a D.A\nin for impeachment\nI'm not sure if this body has ever\nimpeached a D.A in Georgia's history but\nI believe my friend representative\nYasmine Neal said that there was in the\n60s\nfinally some may say the biggest the\nvoters can decide but the common voter\ndoes not know what is going on inside of\na prosecutor's office\nthe Constitution mandates equal\nprotection of each and every law not\njust some until we change the\nConstitution and the Bill of Rights I\nwant all of my rights and so do the\nsixty thousand constituents I represent\ncrimes against women in particular\nthat have lost people will crimes\nagainst women as well as families that\nhave lost children to police violence\nare particularly harmed by prosecutorial\nmisconduct and lawlessness\nboth\nexcuse me each district has its own\nstories\nprosecutorial misconduct for crimes\nagainst women further victimized women\nif a woman is harmed by someone she's\nmarried to or in a romantic or friendly\nrelationship with prosecutors have\nbecome numb to these violations because\nmany women decide later they don't want\nto press charges\nbut for those that have truly been\ntraumatized by a crime and victimizing\ntheir Community they're further\nvictimized because prosecutors have\nbecome none none\na prosecutor repeatedly\nrepeatedly told an immigrant woman that\ndoesn't speak English they can't help\nher because she's married to the Accuser\nfinally I was able to get her help from\nthe grace commission after months\nas a victim of stalking I received calls\nfrom all over the state about stalking\nfrom women pleading for help because the\nprosecutors have become numb to their\nstories\nadditionally some prosecutors practice\nsubjectivity over objectivity with a\nSprinkle of helping a friend\nif there are part of the defense\nwhile they're working for Georgia and\nGeorgia's victims\npolice officers admit they take their\ninvestigations to the D.A office before\nthe judge that could potentially issue\nan arrest warrant police officers and\nDistrict Attorneys have decided to\npartner which gives prosecutors\nadditional Authority as judge and jury\nthe police perspective is if the\nprosecutor tells them they refuse to\nprosecate the case and won't do anything\nwith the evidence presented it doesn't\nmake sense for them to go in front of a\njudge to get a warrant for the crime\nand just like that the prosecutor has\nhindered hinder Justice and due process\nfrom the onset\nthe current prosecutorial system has\nlost objectivity because prosecutors\nbelieve themselves some to be the ruler\nof the law without oversight\nthis coordinated effort to eliminate\njudicial oversight and due process is\nunbeknownst to the General Public\nit's a secret relationship between some\nDA's and some officers\npeople have the right to speak freely\njust as I am\nthis is my right and why I'm speaking on\nbehalf of House Bill 231 and the victims\nthat have been victimized by prosecutors\nyou can't shut people up because you\ndon't like them or what they say and you\ncertainly can't muzzle a person because\nthey don't agree with you but\nprosecutors\ncan silence a citizen's voice\nfrom ever being heard\nhow would you feel as a victim\nif your voice is stolen\nand you lose your right to due process\nof the law\nI say this bill is bad\nI say this bill is bad it's actually\nvery sad\nthe saddest part of this political\npropaganda is that it only helps the\npolitician while further suppressing\nvictims that are overlooked marginalized\nand alienated\nthere are a group of families that stand\non the capitol steps year after year\nI've seen them for the past two years\nthey hold up pictures of their loved\nones mostly their children because of\npolice violence\nabout three weeks ago I learned\nno one was helping them\nI ultimately spent seven hours with each\nof them over the course of the next two\ndays to understand the details of each\nkilling and to introduce them to some\nbipartisan leadership in hopes of a\nsolution for prosecutorial reform\nI met with the governor's office as well\nto introduce these family stories to the\nhighest officer in our state Governor\nBrian Kemp victims don't care about\nparty affiliation they want help\nDavis Benjamin and Andrew Smyrna Jr's\nfamily\nwish the Dekalb D.A did more for their\ncases\nPernell Harris's family Wishes the\nCoffee County D.A did more for their\ncases\njabril Robinson and Eric Holmes they\nwish the Clayton D.A did more for their\nfamily members that were killed and\nleading boykin's family wishes Paulding\nCounty did more for their family member\nthat was killed\nJairus likes Nigel Collins and more have\nbeen coming to the Capitol holding\npictures of their loved ones but not\ngetting Justice because of prosecutorial\nsubjectivity\nsome may call it discretion\nothers call it a violation of their\nrights\nDA's can't be allowed to abuse their\noffice to help friends\nthey cannot be allowed to abuse their\noffice by helping defense out if that is\nwhy they're doing it they also cannot\nsay that they're not Prosecuting cases\nbecause they just don't have the time or\nresources\nthere must be an opportunity for checks\nand balances with the chief law\nenforcement officer of a county which\nrepresents the state of Georgia their\npower is traumatizing when used\ninappropriately in a frivolous manner\nthis is not a Democrat Republican bill\neven though it is being portrayed that\nway\nbut Democrats in my district want\nJustice in Safe Streets\nno one likes people looking over their\nshoulder but the safety of Georgia\nGeorgians is at a critical stage right\nnow and it requires much from our\nprosecutors\nthere is a D.A in Georgia\nthat has committed crimes\nand I say to you again\nalleged crimes I say to you again\nto get help for victims you cannot go to\nthe AG's office\nthe AG's office will tell you you have\nto file a civil suit you cannot go to\nthe bar it's too difficult to file\ncomplaints with the bar if you're not an\nattorney voters who elect the DA's have\nno idea what is going on and we've\ntalked about impeachment that hasn't\nhappened since the 1960s\nthis bill doesn't solve every problem\nbut it's better than nothing and it\nbrings attention to a neglected problem\nwe actually need a prosecutorial reform\nstudy committee to dig deeper into the\ninjustices happening across this great\nstate\nvote for your community and the families\nI mentioned that didn't get Justice from\ntheir prosecutors your yes vote will\nlead the state one step closer to\nfairness for victims that have been\ntraumatized by prosecutor\nlawlessness\nthank you\nthe lady has yielded the well\nthe chair recognizes representative\nPetrie to speak to the bill\nthank you madam speaker ladies and\ngentlemen the house\nI'll tell you a couple stories I want to\nbegin by just asking you a question\nso how is an oversight committee correct\nand appropriate\nfor our judges who have the vast power\nto sentence someone to life or to\ndismiss a case but not for district\nattorneys who have their own vast\nAuthority and discretion\nso when a D.A fails to fulfill their\noath of office and to protect the\ncommunity they are indeed the chief law\nenforcement officer in the community\nand then they pretend they're protected\nsomehow under the guise of being elected\nofficial how long does the community\nsuffer\nand so I listened a moment ago to\nrepresentative Evans and I wanted to say\nAmen about something you're speaking to\nrepresentative\nindeed these issues are in both both\ntypes of counties to use that\nphraseology whether they're red or blue\nmatters not to me and I'm going to give\nyou two examples\ntwo examples of a red and a blue County\nto make your point\nso let me I'm going to tell you a story\nabout the county I live in then I'm\ngoing to tell you a story about the\ncounty\nmy father died in where my Farm's\nlocated\neach politically different\nsame problems so let me tell you a\nlittle bit about Chatham County right\nnow\nin Chatham County in the last two years\nwe've had 30 murders reduced dismissed\nor pled to probation\nwe had a rapist who got 18 months for\nraping a girl a young lady\nwe've had victims that have not been\nnotified of Court hearings and pleas in\nviolation of the law of course we had\n143 employees two years ago in our DA's\noffice\nnow down to 75.\nour judges got a memo about whole\nclasses of laws that would not no longer\nbe prosecuted our DA's office was\nrecently held in contempt of court by\nsitting Superior Court judge for not\ncomplying with numerous scheduling\norders resulting in delays\nwe've had several not guilty verdicts\nfor murder in the last month alone due\nto lack of experience\nand due to the high turnover most of our\nSuperior Courts are understaffed and one\nindeed has no assigned DA's to it today\nso\nthat's one example now let me give you\nanother example of a completely\ndifferent County\nthe place where my daddy died so about\nthree years ago my daddy died in an\naccident\nwhere the other he was hit and he was he\nwas killed in an accident and the other\ndriver\nat 8 A.M\nwas way drunk way over the legal limit\n8 A.M\nhe had a history of multiple DUIs he was\ndriving on a suspended license he had no\ninsurance\ndoesn't matter the county\nbut here's what happened\nrepeated calls to the county to the\ncourthouse to find out when is this man\ngoing to trial repeated calls again and\nagain and again messages left again and\nagain and again never a call back\nfamily was never notified when it went\nto trial\nand indeed it went to trial and that man\nwas given reckless driving my friends\nwhen I finally Weeks Later\nfound the incompetent and corrupt\nsolicitor of Evans County Georgia\nlet me tell you what he told me I wrote\nit down in my notes\non a yellow sticky pad the day I finally\ngot him on the phone this is what he\ntold me quote\nI did not know there was an accident in\nthat case\nmy friends I don't care what county\nyou're in\nwhen you're the chief law enforcement\nofficer of a community you have one job\nand that is to protect the community\nand if you can't do that\nsomebody needs to provide some oversight\nand some guidance and that's what we're\ntrying to do here this measure I hope\nyou'll join me in voting for this Bill\nthank you madam speaker\nchair recognizes the majority leader\nAdministration to speak to the bill\nthank you madam speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house I come to you\ntoday to speak to a very specific aspect\nof House Bill 231\nof course I'm a former assistant\ndistrict attorney worked as a prosecutor\nfelony prosecutor and familiar with the\nresponsibilities the DA's have\nbut also I want to talk to you as a\nlegislator and I've spoken on this\nsubject from this well\nyou know this issue and I think that\nthis is very important to note because\nthe characterization of this issue in my\nmind has really been distorted as we've\nbeen debating this uh discussing the\nbill this session\nyou know this issue originally came I\nremember the moment when this issue was\nfirst discussed with me\nit was just after the horrific video of\nAhmad Arbury\nwas made public of his murder was made\npublic\nand I was I had a call with an attorney\nrespected attorney from the southern\nCenter for human rights respected civil\nrights organization discussing\nshe and I had served together on the\ncouncil for Criminal Justice Reform\ndiscussing the needed reforms we needed\nto see as a result of this horrific\nvideo and at the time it was 2020 we\nwere on the break for the pandemic at\nthe time and the hate crimes Bill had\npassed the Georgia house in 2019 was\npending in the state senate\nand we discussed number one we've got to\npass the hate crimes law\nnumber two we've got to repeal citizens\narrest\nand as you recall we've done both of\nthose things in this chamber and in this\nschool Dome\nbut the third thing we discussed back in\n2020 was the need for prosecutorial\noversight the fact that in Georgia there\nwas no means of holding DA's accountable\nif they acted in a corrupt or an illegal\nmanner\nthere was no effective means under the\nlaw as we had for judges with the jqc\nand we needed something comparable for\nDA's\nand you know as this issue has been\ndiscussed this session I feel that that\nhas really been missed that was the\nGenesis at least in my mind of how this\nissue came about\nand the need to have oversight for\nprosecutors I think ever since has\nreally been shown and you know why\nbecause since that call since that time\nthere have been times in Georgia where\nthere have been multiple elected\nprosecutors under serious investigation\nor under indictment\nmultiple prosecutors and there was no\nmeans to take steps effectively as this\nbill would provide for to allow for an\ninvestigation by competent individuals\nqualified to look into the allegations\nand by a panel to allow for removal\nI would just submit to you that having\nbeen a prosecutor understanding the\nimportance of prosecutorial discretion\nthis bill in no way erodes that in fact\nI think it highlights the importance of\nit the importance and necessity to\nreview cases Case by case\nit also I think recognizes that the\nproposed alternatives for removing\nprosecutors just are not sufficient\nunless this bill is passed\nwaiting on the voters to consider an\nissue with a D.A until the next election\nis up having the the voters in a\ndistrict you just have to live with\nthings as they are until the next\nelection four years from from then\nthat's not practical\nthe State Bar of Georgia generally only\ntakes action against licensed lawyers\nand in criminal cases after the\nconviction has occurred\nthat I'm familiar with\nan impeachment\nif we're not in session what are we\nwaiting until the legislative session\nreconvenes in January or holding a\nspecial session to pursue impeachment I\ndon't see these as viable options\nthis is a reasonable approach under the\ncircumstances to deal with a real issue\nand that is there are certain we have\nterrific prosecutors in the state of\nGeorgia but for those circumstances\nwhere a D.A or a solicitor is violating\nthe law is instigating sexual harassment\nis cause is the target of a corruption\ninvestigation we need to have adequate\nlaw so that the voters are protected so\nthat the citizens are protected and the\nimmense power that an elected prosecutor\nhas as has been discussed is not further\nabused and it's for that reason I would\nencourage you to vote in favor of House\nBill 231. thank you madam speaker I\nyield the will\nthe gentleman has yielded the well there\nis a Minority Report is there any\nobjection to the previous question being\nordered the chair here is none the\nprevious question is ordered the chair\nrecognizes\nrepresentative Roberts to for the time\nreserved for The Minority Report thank\nyou madam chair I'm Madam speaker\num\ncolleagues I rise today to ask you to\nvote no on House Bill 231 in addition to\nall the reasons outlined by my\ncolleagues I think every single one of\nus needs to think about this I have\nlistened to all the arguments and as an\nattorney\nI know how much\nthought and preparation has to go into\neach case and we as attorneys we use\ndiscretion whether it's a civil case or\ncriminal case\nthese prosecutors or solicitors are\nsubject to the State Bar the\nConstitution there are multiple avenues\nfor which we can hold them accountable\nincluding elections\nthe sponsors of this bill have been very\nopen about why they are filing it and\nwho they're targeting the thing I heard\nmost was Democratic DA's that have made\nstatements about not Prosecuting\nspecific types of cases\num\nbut here's the thing all the DA's who\ntestified in our committee said their\ndecision not to prosecute\nuh crimes such as\na doctor whose administering\nreproductive care\num\nis because they were prioritizing\nviolent crimes pursuant to their\nprosecutorial discretion\nisn't that what we've been doing this\nentire session\nI have listened to bills addressing gang\ncrimes drive-by shootings increasing\nmandatory minimums in several sections\nof our criminal code\nso if the targeted DA's and members of\nthis body are focused on what we keep\ntalking about which is Public Safety and\nreducing violent crime in Georgia then\nwhy do we need to spend valuable\ntaxpayer dollars to create another layer\nof government to perform prosecutorial\noversight when our code and Constitution\nalready have Provisions that do just\nthat\nall of our DA's across the state are\noverworked understaffed and underfunded\nwhy would we put additional burdens on\nthem when they are trying to protect\nGeorgians just like we are\nsomething else to consider in subsection\nF5 on line 175 one of the grounds for\ndiscipline\nremoval or involuntary requirement is\nand I quote conduct prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice which brings\nthe office into disrepute\nand for reference the Cambridge English\ndictionary defines disrepute as the\nstate of not being respected or trusted\nbut who decides if a D.A\nis in a state of not being trusted some\nof you might think it's the liberal D.A\nsaying they won't prosecute certain\narguably less violent crimes\nyou would say they qualified under this\nvery Broad and ambiguous ground for\ndiscipline others of us in this chamber\nmight think a D.A is in a state of not\nbeing trusted when she consistently\nrequests bond be denied in cases that\nhaven't been sufficiently investigated\nand it results in citizens unnecessarily\nspending months or even years in jail\nonly to be acquitted\nI'm aware of one rural D.A who took\noffice at the end of 2020 and just in\njust two years under her leadership\nwrongfully accused individuals\nspent a cumulative total of seven\nthousand days in jail only to be\nacquitted by a judge a jury of their\npeers or a dismissal\none particular gentleman requested Bond\nthree times spent over three years in\njail\nonly to receive a not guilty verdict\nsomeone might say they were just being\ntough on crime\nthat they were keeping the violent\ncriminals in jail\nI think we can agree that bringing the\noffice into disrepute is open to so many\ninterpretations and we may all want to\nthink about our own DA's and whether we\nwant to open this Pandora's Box\nduring the Committee hearing I tried to\nmake a friendly amendment to at least\nlimit who could file a complaint against\na D.A I wanted it to be restricted to a\nvoter\nin the county or judicial circuit where\nthe D.A or solicitor general was elected\nor appointed or a victim of crime\nthat occurred in that same jurisdiction\nthis would prevent for example a Fulton\nCounty voter from filing a complaint\nagainst the D.A in Bullitt County simply\nbecause they believed her conduct was\npresident prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice\nthe D.A is elected by the people of that\nCounty or judicial circuit and they know\nbest who represents their values so I\nbelieve standing should be limited to\nthose voters but my friendly Amendment\nwasn't accepted\nI thought that was really strange you\nknow we've all said this isn't political\nbut why would they object to standing\nthat makes sense\nand I think it was raised that anyone in\nthe state can file a State Bar\ncomplaint so why shouldn't it be the\nsame that's true but if you go on the\nstate Bar's website and you pull up the\nform that you file it very clearly asks\nwhen was your first contact with that\nattorney\nthe nature of Bar complaints is you're\ncomplaining about your attorney\nyou have special\ngrievances against them and how they\nrepresented you so I think we should\nkeep that same thought process to\nstanding but this was not accepted so I\nhave to ask myself again why why are we\nspending taxpayer money to create\nanother level of government when there\nare already Provisions to address\nprosecutorial oversight the only\nconclusion I can reach is that it's more\nof the same we've been seeing where\nmembers of this body don't like\nDemocrats that Democrats are winning\nelections so they want us\nsubstitute their will over the that of\nthe voters in those majority Democratic\ncommunities we saw it last year with\nlocal districting bills but y'all this\nis dangerous territory when you start\nchipping away at georgian's fundamental\nright to elect their local leaders and\nthey can't even hold you accountable at\nThe Ballot Box because they aren't in\nyour District that is the very\ndefinition of authoritarianism\ndemographics are changing populations\nare increasing who knows what the\npolitical landscape will be in two years\nor ten years before you vote on this\nbill I want every member of this body to\nreally think about whether you want\nsomeone from outside your community\nfiling complaints against your D.A or\nsolicitor general because this bill\ndoesn't just allow liberal DA's to be\nchallenged more importantly consider we\nhave a multiple we have multiple Avenues\nunder our state code and Constitution\nfor addressing these issues\nis this the best use of taxpayer money\nbecause the fiscal note that was done\ninitially on this is 1.5 million dollars\nthen it was brought up it was added to\nthe bill that special recall elections\nand the sponsors of the bills said there\nwas no fiscal note on that\num we have no idea how many challenge\nhow many complaints against DA's will be\nbe brought uh so we have no idea what\nthat cost is is that how we want to be\nspending taxpayer money when we already\nhave Avenues to resolve this finally if\nour DA's are prioritizing reducing\nviolent crimes shouldn't we be\nsupporting them rather than targeting\nthem thank you\nMadam speaker I'm just trying to see you\nthere I yield the well\nthere are no questions and the lady has\nyielded the well it's the Chairman's\ntime and the chair recognizes chairman\nSmith to speak on the bill\nthank you madam speaker uh Madam speaker\nI yield the balance of the Chairman's\ntime to Vice chairman Gaines\nthe gentleman has yielded the well and\nthe chair recognizes representative\nGaines to speak to the bill for the\nChairman's time thank you madam speaker\nand first I want to start off by\nthanking representative gullet for his\nleadership on this issue and bringing\nthis issue to the Forefront uh the\nspeaker just before me mentioned that we\nwere targeting Democrats well his\ninterest in this bill is because the\nRepublican D.A who had issues in that\nCommunity but his leaders as leader\nregistration outlined you know the the\nreal intent behind this measure has been\nuh has been widely uh but the issue and\nthe purpose behind this has been\ndistorted\nboth by the national media when you read\nwhat's I saw an article on the New York\nTimes this weekend about this bill\nwhat they're saying is the intent behind\nit and what the minority party is saying\nin the intent behind the legislation\nit's not where it's not what the issue\nis actually before you\nwhen I hear the minority party talking\nabout discretion this bill does nothing\nto take away the discretion of elected\nsolicitors and District Attorneys that's\nnot what this bill is about\ninstead I want to walk you through what\nthis measure will address in our state\nwe have an issue in areas throughout\nGeorgia and representative Petrie talked\nabout this in in the Chatham Area but I\nwant to tell you about the Western\nJudicial Circuit\non day one when our district attorney\nwas elected she put out a memo outlining\nwhat what cases and what issues she\nsimply was not going to prosecute what\nwhat offenses she was just going to\nchoose on her own to not prosecute and\nthat memo is right here was the first\nthing she did on day one\nthat was early on in her term but let me\ntell you just this was over just the\nlast four months what I'm about to\noutline for you again this is just the\nlast four months and the Western\nJudicial Circuit and explain to you why\nlives are at stake and the importance of\npassing this measure I'll start off just\nwith an example a couple of weeks ago\nwhere our district attorney was actually\ncaught lying to the court and that\nbrought issues before in that case\nthe Superior Court judges all four of\nour Superior Court judges signed a\nletter in which it outlined how cases\nare being delayed because the LA the\nstate's lack of preparation and or\nfailure to follow proper procedures\nthe DA's office has an issue with staff\nStaffing I'll read just a couple\nheadlines from articles in our local\nnewspaper western western circuits DA's\noffice limping along with decimated\nstaff of prosecutors while they were\nbudgeted for 17 they're down to just\nthree assistant district attorneys\nand you may say well all da offices are\nhaving challenges with Staffing right\nnow while another local paper went out\nand talked to other DA's into the\nsurrounding counties and the headline\nnearby judicial circuits don't have Ada\nshortages as significant as the Western\nJudicial Circuit\nand here's a brief quote from the\narticle while D.A Deborah Gonzalez is\nattributed to prosecutorial Staffing\ncrisis to non-competitive salaries the\nOconee Enterprise discovered that two of\nthe four surrounding judicial circuits\nare not experiencing Ada shortages to\nthe same extent as the Western Judicial\nCircuit\nbut really let's get into some cases and\ntalk through so those are those are\noffice issues but here are the real\nconsequences for having no prosecutorial\noversight in our state\neffin sex trafficking case dismissed due\nto mishandling by the DA's office that's\na headline in our local paper the judge\nhad dismissed a case against a 25 year\nold who faced charges of trafficking of\na person for sexual servitude statutory\nrape kidnapping false imprisonment and\naggravated child molestation the case\nhad hadn't been brought to trial under\nthe speedy trial statute because a\nprosecutorial mismanagement so an\nindividual who was facing charges again\nof statutory rape kidnapping false\nimprisonment and aggravated child\nmolestation was not brought to trial\nbecause simply the DA's office failed to\ndo its job\nhere's another case acquitted a murder\nin Athens charged with murder in Jackson\nCounty a man who beat murder charges in\nAthens over a year ago was recently\narrested for a murder in Jackson County\nthis was an individual that the law\nenforcement agency had found the murder\nweapon on the suspect the DA's office\nfailed to call several key suspects that\nseveral key witnesses that would have\nput the suspect of the sign of the scene\nof the crime so someone is now dead\nbecause of her because of the DA's\noffice in confidence again acquitted of\nmurder in Athens a year later goes and\nkills somebody else in Jackson County\nhere's another headline Athens woman\nacquitted a murder charges another\nmurder charge and boyfriend's 2019\nshooting death and her in her first\ncriminal trial as a prosecutor RDA by\nthe way just tried her first case\npersonally in the last three months\nreportedly tried district attorney\nDeborah Gonzalez reportedly tried to\nprove that as a motive for killing the\nindividual the suspect stood the game\nfrom an insurance policy however the\nprosecution was unable to get the\ninsurance policy before the jury due to\na judge ruling the proper foundations\nfor proper foundation for its\nintroduction to the trial as evidence\nhad not been laid just the other day I\nwas speaking to a 2L a second year law\nstudent group here at the Capitol they\nknew how to introduce evidence in a case\nlike that but our district attorney did\nnot\nhere's another headline again these are\nall from the last four months improper\nCourt procedure leads to dismissal of a\ncase of Athens man who allegedly shot a\nvictim in the neck\nthe case of an Athens man accused of\nshooting a person in the neck was\nrecently dismissed because proper Court\nprocedure had not been followed\nthe judge dismissed the case because the\ndistrict attorney failed to bring it to\na grand jury yet again to have talked to\nmany lawyers and very few don't\nrecognize the need to bring it to a\ngrand jury we've seen issue after issue\nafter issue in our community lives are\ntruly at stake and areas where you have\nprosecutors who don't know how to do\ntheir job and are failing to do their\njob that's why this bill is so important\nand I would urge this body for the\npeople of the Western Judicial Circuit\nbut circuits across this state\nprosecutors need oversight I can't think\nof another elected office in this state\nwhere there is zero oversight so I would\nask this body it's favorable\nconsideration of House Bill 231 because\nlives truly are at stake we can't wait\ntwo more years in Athens for the next\nelection we can't wait in other areas\nthroughout this state so please join me\nin voting for House Bill 231 and Madam\nspeaker I will yield the well\nah\nMr Speaker\ngood catch\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to adopting the\ncommittee's substitute\nchair here's none The committee's\nSubstitute is adopted is there any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill\nthe chair here has done the report of\nthe committee is agreed to shall this\nbill now pass all in favor of the\npassage of the bill we'll vote Yes all\nthose opposed will vote no and the clerk\nwill unlock the machine\nfor what purpose does representing Stacy\nEvans rise parliamentary inquiry state\ntree inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true\nthat the system that we have Works isn't\nit true that the Paulding D.A that we\nheard so much about was ultimately\nremoved by the governor and could have\nbeen removed much sooner if the Attorney\nGeneral had actually acted and stood in\nhis power and isn't it further true Mr\nSpeaker that the D.A that mishandled to\nsay the least the Ahmad Aubry case was\nalso taken care of under the system that\nwe have and that is the voters voted\nthat person out the very next\nopportunity they have so isn't it\nfurther true Mr Speaker that this bill\nis completely unnecessary\nI'm sure the lady has her opinion our\nattorney general's a fine man and a\ngreat jurist does a great job\nfor what purpose does represent\nrepresentative Kennard rise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry Mr\nSpeaker is it not true that when the\nGlenn County prosecutor failed to Levy\ncharges in the arbory case that the\nAttorney General exercised prosecutor\nprosecutorial oversight by grabbing a\nnew prosecutor in another County and\nthat person successfully prosecuted that\ncase that led to a conviction is that\nnot prosecutor prosecutorial oversight\nsir I'm sure the gentleman has an\nopinion and I'm sure he believes in what\nhe speaks\nfor what purpose is Chairman Collins\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry is\nit not true that I'm supporting House\nBill 231 because of a terrible job that\na former Republican D.A out in West\nGeorgia did and I want to make sure we\nhave oversight of these kind of folks\nI'm sure the gentleman knows of what he\nspeaks that's where he's from\nfor what purposes represent representing\nMiller rise\nthank you Mr Speaker parliamentary\ninquiry State inquiry is it not true\nthat the jqc which is the commission\nupon which the prosecution oversight\ncommission is modeled often takes years\nupwards of five or six years to\nadjudicate complaints against judges\nI'm not sure how that agency works but\nI'm sure the lady knows of what she\nspeaks follow-up question you have a\nfurther inquiry yes yes Mr Speaker isn't\nit not true that the fastest way to\nremove a district attorney who has\ncommitted a violation of their oath of\noffice is to indict them as the Attorney\nGeneral already has the power to and for\nthe governor to suspend him them which\nhe can do immediately isn't that the\nmost efficient way to deal with Wayward\nprosecutors I'm sure the lady is\neducated and it matters she speaks about\nand she certainly believes everything\nshe just said to me and to this body\nhave all members voted\nhave all
