  "transcript": "you you you joining the of my Radio We are about to have the morning roll called. We are about to have the morning roll called. All right, we're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. I need someone to vote present for representative Lopez. I have all members voted. All members vote. All right, you can come down here and check with the clerk's office. The clerk will lock the machines. The doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. Beautiful day out there today. And we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 86th House District Representative Zoolmolo Pez. Representative Lopez. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Dear colleagues, my name is Zoolmolo Pez and I am the newly elected representative for House District 86 in the Cap County. If you hear a very thick southern accent, that is because I'm originally from Puerto Rico. The idea that those who do not sound like us or look like us are here to take things from us or here to hurt us cannot be more sovereign today, the one-year anniversary of the murder of Amad Arbery. We are wearing this ribbon in remembrance of that senseless murder. Although I was not raised Jewish, my husband is Jewish and we have been members of the temple since 2009. The temple is at Lantas oldest and most diverse synagogue. Some of you may know that it was bombed in 1958 in an act of anti-Semitism or that our former rabbi rabbi was child, Marshwe Doctor Martin Luther King. Our current rabbi here today is rabbi Peter S. Berg. Rabbi Berg has been our senior rabbi since 2008 and you can read his impressive resume and accolades online. But I want to highlight the fact that rabbi Berg serves in numerous communal and advisory boards, was inducted into the College of Preachers at Morehouse College in 2009 and most recently was named one of the top 50 rabbi's in the United States. But what I'm most proud is rabbi Berg's unwavering commitment to serve as both a spiritual and community leader on issues regarding the environment, social justice and civil rights. Please help me welcome my rabbi, rabbi Peter S. Berg. Good morning. Speaker Austin, distinguished members of this house, representatives Oma Lopez for your warm and generous invitation to be here today in your gracious introduction. We are blessed by your leadership in this house. I'm pleased to be here today as the rabbi of the temple, Georgia's largest and Atlanta's oldest synagogue. This has been a most challenging year. Any of us can remember. With the wind of anti-Semitism blowing through our society at an all time high. With the raging fire of the worst global pandemic we have seen in our lifetime. And the earthquake of unresolved racial issues shaking all around us. We are divided and fractured as a state and as a nation. Now more than ever we need to stand together with each other in order to stop division and the spread of hatred in our world. All forms of xenophobia and hatred. And after all brothers and sisters we may have different religions and political ideologies. But we share similar hopes for our state which call for justice and compassion and peace. This world is a diverse place and the lessons of both religion and politics must be articulated in a way that are acceptable to a diverse population. Because it is possible, it is very possible that God could speak Arabic on Fridays, Hebrew on Saturdays and Latin on Sundays. And I'd like to suggest that we see the differences among people as nothing short of a miracle of creation. The only way to truly respect and love one another is to recognize the uniqueness of each and every human being. The world is a better place because of our differences. Positive energy comes from the members of our community who sometimes disagree yet still love and still respect each other. And because we are privileged to live in this American democracy and the extraordinary state of Georgia which is dependent upon strong communities of faith and a representative government, we must learn how to speak to each other. All world religions pray for peace. All government entities strive for justice. Yet we know that fervor produces the worst in zealotry and in violence. How could we channel the passion and persistence that religious faith and government can summon? How can we utilize the ability of religion and government to contextualize the big issues in the most universal of terms? This is the great task that faces us this year to engage in dialogue without unleashing intolerance and self-righteousness. The challenge of American democracy is to fashion a way that incompatible faith and political assertions can actually still speak to each other and still learn from each other. We don't have to ignore our differences to live together. And when we speak to our neighbors of other faiths and other political ideologies, what is needed most is not authority but reasoning. A dialogue that focuses not on quotations but on common ground. Founded on a deeply religious principle, our country, our state is an experiment in progress. And the hypothesis that we test is that a diverse population can come together in a shared passion for liberty and a celebration of our differences to accomplish great things. But religion and government, they can both continue to play an essential role. And it's the logical grounding for our democracy that we can learn to speak to each other in ways that we can hear in words that allow for learning and growth and even disagreement. This task in no small part is the last and the greatest hope in our humanity. Seated together as our ancestors did before us, we know that we face an uncertain future. We are unsure of what challenge lies over the next hill and the next mountain. But I would like to think that like them, we don't face that steep climb into despair, resigned to a terrible fate, nor with blind certainty. Rather, we are here because we face that mountain over which lies the work that we do together with hope renewed, resolved to draw upon our faith in God and humanity to create a Georgia that is filled with peace, and joy, and wisdom. Friends, let us stand together now in prayer. Eternal God, you anobal our lives by empowering us to do your work here on earth in creating a world of justice and peace for all. May your name be invoked only to inspire and to unify our state, but never to divide it. We ask your blessings upon the leaders of our nation and these leaders of the state of Georgia. May our honorable elected representatives lead wisely and with civility working together for our common good. Guide them that they may ever be champions of justice. These things we ask in your name, O God, until the radiance of peace and righteousness for all of God's children shines to the ends of the earth. And along the way, if we are weary, give us strength. If we are discouraged, give us hope. If we have forgotten how to make a difference, remind us. If we have been careless of time, forgive us. And if our hearts have been chilled by indifference, warm them. May we together be inspired not only by the acts of the women and men who have preceded us, but by the God of the universe who wants us to live in peace. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

If you have signed up for a morning order, be prepared to be recognized by the chair. Chair recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Hawkins, Chairman Barr, Chairman Dubnik, and Representative Dunahue. One minute each of morning orders today, gentlemen and mapror seat. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last night, the state of Georgia lost a giant, as big Jim Walters went to be with his Lord and Savior. Big Jim had a big heart and gave to many. His name graces many buildings, such as the YMCA, the near technical college, northeast Georgia, just to name a few. Jim was a pioneer in the Georgia Industrial Loan Association. While owning many businesses throughout the country, he always took time to lend an ear and give advice to young and old. He served under many governors and even a couple of presidents. I will always remember his words only in America what a great country this is. Chair recognizes Chairman Belton for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to remember Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator. Everybody knows the first line that Gettysburg addressed four scores and seven years ago, but few can recall the next and most important sentence. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. This wasn't the rhetorical question from a confident leader. He was a heart-wrenching query from an embattled president and an emissioned doubt from a beleaguered man who sent 600,000 men to their deaths. Did Lincoln know his sacrifice would create the most powerful, most prosperous, most just nation on the planet? Of course not. America in 1863 was a weak backwater nation. But he knew that a new nation, conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men created equal was worth the cost, so that government of the people, by the people, for the people should not perish from the earth. Prior to 1776, every government on the planet was designed to protect the power and the wealth of a monarch. These United States, the first place on earth, where government was made to ensure the freedom of the people from the government. Lincoln called the Bible when he gave freedom to all men. He quoted Jesus when he said that a house divided cannot stand. He quoted his scripture when he asked us not to judge one another. Instead he said, with malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness in our belief in God, let us finish the work we are in to bind the nation's wounds, to care for him who bore the battle, to achieve and cherish, adjust in everlasting peace among ourselves and all nations. Chair recognizes for a morning order representative Al Williams and representative Gloria Frazier and Chairman Don Hogan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At the start of World War II after Pearl Habba, President Roosevelt said something that this country will never forget. He said today is the day that will live in infamy. There are 23rd, 2020 is the day that will live in infamy in Georgia. On that day, Abbaud Abbaud was viciously murdered on the street in Green County. But a lot of good things happened in spite of. And this family and his mother, this wonder Cooper who is listening, somebody that this state is still with you. This family, but most of all those of us up here, we want to make sure that there be some heroes that are not forgotten who has made things happen in this state. Thanks, Speaker Rauston, who spoke eloquently about Abbaud Abbaud Abbaud Abbaud at the beginning of this session. We thank Governor Kim. We are strong words at the signing of House Bill 479. Thank you, Sheriff Neil Jump, Sheriff Don and Glenn County, who went out of his way to make sure that folks were safe and things were orderly. And the two big Reynolds from the GBI who made sure there was a thorough and quick investigation. Dean Smire, Representative Gloria Frazier, Representative Don Hogan. Now looked up that day and Representative Hogan was standing there because he knew Glenn County needed justice. So we pause today in memory of Abbaud Abbaud Abbaud because he had to die, unfortunately, for us to take an inward look and see what needed to be done in Georgia. And Georgia is starting to rise to the occasion. Let me say this. If you're virtually at sense, all things work together for good. For those who love the Lord and live according to His purpose. We're seeing good come out of tragedy. May we all remember January 23 and strive to do better in this journey called life. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Thank you. Chair recognizes for a morning order. Chairman Corbett, Chairman Ron Stevens, and Representative Ridley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 105 recognizes February 23, 2021 as dyslexia day at the Capitol. If it were not for COVID, there would be 200 kids here going around trying to bring awareness to this disease. And it is treatable when called early. I was first made aware of this with a constituent of mine about four years ago. Her son was told he's a boy. He just learns slower. He's okay. But anyway, she had him tested and turned out he had dyslexia. They got him the proper treatment, the different way of teaching these kids. Anyway, now he is excelling in school. His name is Gabe Hewling and we'll give a shout out to Gabe and keep up the good work. Chair recognizes Representative Sandra Scott for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A victorious woman, a phenomenal woman. A woman that give freely to the sick, elderly, and children. A woman who is committed to helping and serving people in Georgia and around the world. A woman that would drive across Georgia, talking to people about issues and stopping in every little town to a boutique. A woman that can call crack a barrel in the middle of Georgia and they will have a pound of that old-fashioned bacon waiting for her when she gets there. She believed in the women of this house during all the national organizations like Nobel Women, the National Foundation of Women Legislators, WEEK, NBCSL, and others. She loved helping and doing for people. We could count on her every Sunday die to say, Mr. Speaker, I am ready to go home. My moment in Black History is former representative Sharon Beasley-Teague. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield a good. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today I bring to you 11-year-old Michaela. I chose Michaela today because she wants to be a future social worker. She also wants to be a foster parent and or a hairstylist. Michaela is a loving child who is easy to get along with, is great with friends, and she looks forward to helping others when she grows up. 11-year-old Michaela is one of the many children who are available for adoption today in the state of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. We are now going home to the rules calendar. Starting on to the rules calendar. There were certain measures that were carried forward. From yesterday's rules calendar, we're going to begin with those. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 245. House Bill 245, our representative, will hood of the 175th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 35 of Title 43, the fiscal to Georgia. Antietta relating the podiatry practice shows the amendment of provision relating the fingerprint and criminal background checks. Ms. Bill Iverick, for the committee on Health and Human Services, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Lohood to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House. House Bill 245 is necessary because last year a bill passed that allowed podiatrists to organize jointly with MDs and DOs, and that law is in practice now. And so inadvertently in the bill last year, the word renewal was used instead of reinstatement. So what happens without my bill today, starting this summer in July, podiatrists will have to get fingerprinted to renew their license. Podiatrists who were currently licensed have already had background checks done, and to keep in line with other healthcare professions similar to theirs, they should not have to get another background check done. Actually if they lose their license and needed to be reinstated, should they need to get their background checked again. So if there's any questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer one or two. You do not appear to have any questions. I ask for your favourable consideration. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of House Bill 245, will vote aye, those opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 245, the eyes are 155. The nays are zero this bill. Having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does representative gains rise to make a motion? State your motion. I like to move that we postpone House Bill 286 to the next legislative day. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 286, my members, have gains in the 117th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 8 of Title 36, the fiscal to Georgia and the senator relating to county police. So, it's a strict the ability of a county governing authority to reduce funding for county police departments. On the gentleman's motion, the House Bill 286 be postponed until the next legislative day is their objection. Chair, here's none. It is so ordered. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 210. House Bill 210, my members, and the court of the 174th and others to be entitled to amend Article 2, chapter 3 and Title 40, the fiscal to Georgia and the senator relating to certificates to titled motor vehicles. So, it's exempt certain vehicles from the recording of Odomina readings upon certificate of title. This bill then refer to the committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring before you House Bill 210, LC 392844S. House Bill 210 is the Department of Revenue Bill. What this does is it brings Georgia and compliance with a federal requirement that when the owner of a motor vehicle sales are transfers that motor vehicle, the Odomina reading has to be entered on the certificate of title for 20 years for a vehicle that is manufactured after 2011. And that's all this bill does, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield for questions if they are any. Looks like you do have a question to you. I yield. Chair recognizes Leader Beverly to your left for a question. Does General Gill? To my friend. So this bill just brings in the compliance what we're doing in the state with the federal state of the report. That is correct. Very good. Thank you very much. And if there's no further question to speak or I would ask everyone to ask the other questions. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those are.\n\nclose the vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 210, the eyes of 163, the three, the nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 342. House Bill 342, by the way, I'm going to have a whispering in the 141st and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 14 and title 43, the fiscal Georgia antenna relating electrical contractors, plumbers, condition air contractors, low-vogue contractors and utility contractors. Social prohibits certain advertisements relating to plumbing, Ms. Bill, I'm referring to the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Washburn to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I come today to present House Bill 342. This is a simple bill. It simply prohibits anyone who does not hold a master plumbers or a journeyman plumbers license from advertising that they do hold such a license. So it's a very simple bill and I would appreciate your consideration of it. I would yield any question, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. Thank you. I'd appreciate your favor or consideration of this bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 342. The eyes are 167. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 354. House Bill 354, by the way, is the $145 to be entitled to amend. Title 43, the fiscal of Georgia and Tate related professions and businesses. So as required, the state board of senators and the state board of funeral services reports a suspected, unlawful activity in the sheriff's office in the attorney general. This bill then referred to the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Rick Williams to present the bill. Thank you, the speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a consumer protection bill. This bill is brought to stop fraud, forgery, and other illegal crimes that are damaging people and families when they have prepaid for funeral or cemetery spaces and the money has not been appropriately put in trust like it's supposed to. This is a reaction to one of the state boards allowing a cemetery to operate 15 years without a license. And during that period of time, there was probably a half a million dollars worth of damage done to families. And that cemetery owner is now in a state prison from breaking the law. And it was done with the sheriff's department and our local district attorney. So this is just a consumer protection bill and I'll stand for any questions, Mr. Speaker. It appears that you do have a question to you. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Bentley to your left for a question. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman. Y'all. Yes, ma'am. I do. Isn't that true that my husband is a fourth generation funeral director in middle Georgia? Yes, ma'am. And is it not further true that although this bad action happened in middle Georgia, we as funeral professionals encourage everyone in this body, in this house, in this Georgia General Assembly, to please consider pre-planning because that is really the best way to prepare for the time when the lower calls us home. That is correct. Thank you for your work on this. And I believe you're a signer to this bill. You're the queen of the funeral caucus and we appreciate your support. You didn't say to strawberry. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. And I appreciate your work on this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. No further questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

No. Any\u0443 move. have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 354, the eyes are 167, the nasors zero. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 367. House Bill 367, by the way, is a parish of the 158th and others. We title an act to amend chapter 13 and title 16. They've just got to Georgia, Antietta, relating to control substances. Those who change certain provisions are relating to schedules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 controlled substances. This bill that I've referred to the committee on Judiciary, that committee, Judiciary Non-Civil, that committee recommends that this bill do pass.

We will talk about S corporations and LLCs. And again, most of the businesses, small businesses in particular, or organized as LLCs. This bill takes advantage of a recent IRS ruling that was published back in November that the Department of Treasury and Internal Assembly, Remini Service, intend to issue proposed regulations to allow these business entities to pay their state and local tax, sorry, their state tax is at the entity level. This bill, we worked hard with the Department of Revenue and make sure we had it right. It is zero revenue impact to the state of Georgia. It comes without objection. Furthermore, the endorsement of the CPA community, the business communities that are involved and Georgia Chamber of Commerce and others. Most of our CPAs in the room, and I know we have several, had a chance to talk to them about it. It will be happy to answer any questions.

Is it not true that eight states have already passed this legislation? Yes, that is correct. They believe 14 more are looking at it as well. Yes, sir. Both Democratic and Republican states.

Thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any other questions, but hearing none, I'd yield the well to the right. You have one, but it's up to you. I'll answer one more, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to your right for a question. Mr. Chairman, you'll be happy to answer another CPA's question. Very good. Is it not true that you and I both found IRS notice 2020-75, which clearly lays out that the Department of Treasury and the IRS are going to allow this treatment thus the state taxes being paid from the partnership entity?

Chair recognizes Chairman Tancersley to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Please stand before you today to present House Bill 161. This is a Department of Community Affairs bill and it's relevant only to downtown development authorities. This bill did pass out of the house last session, but my funeral homes, funeral home friends, will understand when I say it was laid to rest in the Senate when COVID came along and sent us all home. So while downtown development authorities can go inactive, they cannot be dissolved. These DDAs are the only authorities in our code section that require perpetual existence. And even though they are inactive, they're still required to generate a financial report every year. So this bill would simply allow municipal governments to legally dissolve these DDAs that are no longer active, they can hold no assets, and they have no outstanding debt or any other obligations. So this legislation is necessary to remove six little words that are underlined on your copy of the bill and that is each authority shall have perpetual existence. By striking this Senate, this bill allows these dormant and active authorities to be legally dissolved. GMA supports this bill and with that Mr. Speaker, I would you for any questions? You do not have any questions. Thank you. I would ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.

The official code of Georgia and tentative relating the certain military certifications that in title of persons to obtain certain professional licenses this bill had referred to the committee on regulated industries. The committee recommends a disbile due pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, House Bill 68 simply extends the time that a service member can use some of the certifications and training that they got while in the military towards a professional license from 180 days to two years. And it's specifically for electrical contractor plumber HVAC, low voltage contractor or utility contractors and those licensing boards can also extend it beyond two years if there's some extenuating circumstances. That's the bill and I'll stand for any questions. You have a question if you care to yield. I will yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Setslor to your right for a question. Mr. Jim and you for you I will. Yes, sir. So this affects the amount of time they can credit. This doesn't change any provisions about testing for certification. This is just time served is extended from the time serve credit extends from 180 days to years. So from the time of their discharge it moves it from 180 days from their discharge to two years that they can apply the training that they received towards a professional license. I see. So they they wouldn't time out and lose the ability to get licensed. Correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. If there are no further questions. No further questions.

This bill I refer to the committee on insurance. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Gamble to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I rise today to present House Bill 241 to you, which deals with service contracts, sometimes called extended warranties. These are optional products that are not mandated by law like homeowners insurance or automobile insurance. Through this legislation, if we pass it, it would allow Georgia to join 48 other states that have already done this. If a consumer cancelled one of these contracts early, it allows for the deduction of claims paid from a refund amount. This protects the consumer by clearly defining the process of what happens when they cancel the contract while also preventing fraud, where someone could technically purchase one of these contracts, file a claim and then immediately cancel it, leaving the company holding the bag. It also adds key fobs in as part of what is allowable under these service contracts. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to yield for questions. You have a question if you care to yield. I do.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill speaks to a follow-up on the bill that we passed about two years ago from massage therapy. It came to the attention of the attorney that helps them through the attorney general's office that it was not completely described within their board rules about who would be doing the testing. So, they are using a national association who they use now and who they've used in the past. The difference is the name is not included. So, in the future they can actually change or make additions. The second addition to this is online 31 and it speaks to certifying the instructor of the course. So, this is more of a cleanup bill. Does not change hours. Does not change any of the requirements but it's just more of a complete definition. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. You do not appear to have any questions.
