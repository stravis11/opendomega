The transcript appears to be a general video of the Senate Mezzanine rather than a formal legislative session. Without any bills, votes, or notable moments mentioned, there is not sufficient content to produce a meaningful structured summary. Please provide a transcript that contains specific legislative actions, debates, or proceedings for me to summarize effectively.",
  "transcript": "This is \"Senate Mezzanine\" by Georgia State Senate on Vimeo, the home for high quality videos and the people who love them.",
