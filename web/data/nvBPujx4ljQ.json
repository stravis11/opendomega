Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 131st House District Representative Beth Camp. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the house. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. And my honor to introduce Pastor Mark Pritchett, who is from Meansville, Georgia, and the wonderful 131 District, which I represent. Mark Pritchett is the founder of Rush Ministries, incorporated in the founding pastor of Northridge Church in Tomiston. He has been married to the love of his life Stephanie for 32 years and they have two amazing children and five grandchildren. I was just informed that the grandchildren are pretty much the best thing ever. He's a 15-year veteran of the United States Army and we thank him and all of our veterans for their service. He's a national speaker, a visionary, and an author with a new book coming out in just a few weeks. He holds a bachelor's degree in business administration, a master's degree in pastoral leadership, and is in the final phases of obtaining his doctoral degree in theology. Mark Pritchett speaks to groups. I had the absolute privilege to be a part of a very tragic, well, the privilege was he was there. And he brought the spirit in. It was a very tragic situation. But Pastor Mark Pritchett came in and he brought so much warmth and love. It was hard not to fill the love of our father in heaven around us at that point in time because he was so compassionate and so kind. He's excited for him to be here today simply because he represents my district in so many ways. He loves the outdoors. He loves America and he certainly tries to bring the word of Christ to those around him. So without further ado, I introduce Pastor Mark Pritchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much, honored lawmakers. And of course, for the invitation, Representative Beth Camp, I appreciate so much those kind words. Any other grandparents in the house, just wave your hand. Praise God for the grandbabies. Amen. That's the gift you get for not killing your children along the way. 1986, 17 years of age, I joined the United States Army. Amen. Because that was my why. My why was very clear to me because I wanted to honor my country. I wanted to represent the Constitution of the United States for America to defend it against all enemies both foreign and domestic and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same. That was my why because it made sense. It made sense and to the point that God changed my why. In 1999, after 10 years of marriage, deployment, life happening and hitting me between the eyes and two children later, my family came under attack as many have. We were soon to be if we remain in that same trajectory, a statistic of a broken home. At that point, God changed my why by healing our marriage. He healed our home and put us on a different path and gave me a different trajectory. He called me after almost 15 years of service the United States military to resign and to follow in a different path to fight a different fight, one of faith and one yet of freedom. From there, I begin to live a different life, still a patriot, still of our nation. But today as a pastor, I look back to that why. I look back to that defining moment that determines who I am today as a father, as a pastor, as a grandparent and again as a patriot. If I can explain it this way, I believe that everything we do in our life originates from that why. In fact, if I were to pull you in here today and ask you, how many of you know a man named Samuel Peerpot Langley? Many of you would say you do not know him. But at the turn of the 20th century in the pursuit of powered man flight, Samuel Peerpot Langley rose above most. He was known by everyone. He was given $50,000 grant by the War Department. He had a seat at Harvard University and he was employed by the Smithsonian in which he would later become the director. He was followed around by all the great news media outlets. Of course, the New York Times rose to the top. He was given all the great minds of the day to follow him in this great pursuit. The problem was that Samuel Peerpot Langley had a problem. He had all the recipes for success but his why was skewed. Because as you see 200 miles away from that place where he lived was Dayton, Ohio and two young brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who owned a bicycle shop. And not from any grants but through their modest earnings or their bicycle shop, they took their money and they pursued that same effort. But not because they wanted fame, not because they wanted wealth, not because they wanted a platform, but because they're hard and they're why originated in air supremacy and battlefield supremacy for the United States military at that time. But also to give man a different means of travel. You see the two distinguishing wise determined the trajectory from that point forward. Because on the day of December the 17th, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright became the first in flight. You see there was a path that took them to a greater cause. There was a why that took them to a greater purpose. And it's interesting because on the day that they put the airplane in flight for the first time, there was no media. The New York Times was not there. In fact, not even the local newspaper. They didn't have degrees. In fact, no one on their team had a college degree including Orville and Wilbur Wright. The difference is they were driven by the cause, the why of their life. And you know, you know this today because at the day that it was announced two or three days later, if they're flight and then to attain the first air flight of a man-powered flight, Samuel Peerpot Langley resigned. He quit. He walked away. He could have added to their why. He could have became through his technological advances, through the minds, through all the accolades and all that he had. Could have made it better. But because of his lack of why that was his end. I say that today because I simply pose this question to you as something I have to reconcile in my mind, you do whether it be in the form of a lawmaker, whether it be a doctor, a lawyer, real estate agent, or whatever it is that you do in your life. Do you remember your why? Do you remember why you ran for this position? Do you remember why you occupy one of these 180 seats? Do you remember the calls for which you fought so hard? Was it for the great pay? I think probably not. If it were up, I think that probably no pun intended didn't pay great dividends. Was it because you believed in a calls greater than yourself? Was it because you truly believe that your vote, your voice, your part in this great thing called the Constitution that your voice could make a difference? You see today as a pastor, I believe that it does. I believe that your role can change the trajectory of history because it matters. But I believe that there's a greater cause that we all must reconcile one day, that there is a name above every other name, that there is a day in which we will stand before our maker, our creator, and the one who can redeem. You see, I believe today, according to the Prince of the Prophet Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 7, he says that all of those who are called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory. You see, our greatest purpose is not to write laws, to change laws, to write bills. Our greatest purpose is not even to pastor a church. If I can be very bold, our greatest passion and purpose is not even to be the husband or the wife or the mother or father or even, as well as it is to be a grandparent. But to be a child of the most high God, to serve him in the capacity in which he has gave us. So today, I challenge you, I implore you, to be reminded of your wine, to get back to that purpose because I believe you can change the world. I want to invite you, if you will, to stand to your feet as we pray today, as we go before the throne of God, to ask for his grace upon your life and upon everything that you will say and do here in this time. Let us pray together. Father, we come today before you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ our Lord. We thank you, Father, that you have made a way where there was no way. We thank you that you have given forethought to this session for every person that sits and occupies the seat. You have given forethought for the bills that would be written, the laws that would be changed, everything that would be challenged. And I pray today that these men and women would honor the sacred constitution that was written, that people have given thought for how it was written under the premise of Christian faith. And I pray today, God, that you would guide their steps, God, that you would go before us. As you say in Psalms 3, I pray you would be the lifter of our head today, that we would walk in a new confidence of who we are in you to realize that there is not just a means to an end, but there is an end. One day, we each will stand before you to hear those words, well done, that faithful servant. God, I pray that that's the words that everyone in this room hears. And God, if not today, you would change hearts before it's everlasting too late. And we give you praise for you alone or worthy. And this in the mighty and matchless name of Jesus we pray, and all of God's people said, Amen. Let us pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south, any room. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Matt Dollar requested that I do this. He thinks I told I would him something, so I'm going to do it. He says, many great men have passed this chamber over the years, but none will be missed more than Matt Dollar. Matt and Matt Dollar wrote that. Somehow I thought he probably did. Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct.

Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of the bills on the local calendar. The eyes are 115. The nays are 46. These bills having received the requisite constitutional majority. I'm sorry. We got three that needed two thirds, did not get it. Mr. Clerk, what were those three keys? House Bill 1029 by Rebs and Jones, the 47th City of Milton, House Bill 1030 by Rebs and Jones, the 47th City of Milton, and House Bill 1031 by Rebs and Jones, the 47th City of Milton. What purpose does the Speaker approach him rise? Make a motion. State your motion. I'd like to move that we actually serve notice that we reconsider this at the proper time. Okay, that would be the next legislative day, and they will be... So, the posture we're in is that, all with the exception of those three bills, the rest of the local calendar passed. What purpose does Chairman Tancersley rise? To make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker, I move that we immediately transmit the local calendar to the Senate. Minus the three bills that are subject to reconsideration. Thank you. The lady has moved that this House immediately transmit the local bills that did receive a requisite constitutional majority to the Senate. Is there any objection? Chair here's none, and it is so ordered, and we will take up the Speaker Pro Tems reconsideration tomorrow. All right, we're going on now to morning orders, going on to morning orders. If you have chairs going to limit morning orders today to two minutes each, no warning at the end of two minutes, the mic will be cut off. Chair recognizes Chairman Dickie for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And colleagues on your desk, you receive an invitation to the University of Georgia College of Agriculture Environmental Sciences or Legislative Reception Day down the blue room. You can go see our great folks that do extension research and education for wonderful college that supports our agriculture throughout this state. And also ensure our great students are being educated in the field of agriculture and agribusiness. And I just want to appreciate y'all coming by and speaking to them. You go next door and get you a lounge county fried quail. But you might see extension and research folks from UGA around the capital day. And just not keep for the great job they are doing over in Athens and throughout our state. I know all of y'all have got offices in each of your counties from our extension and research folks and just they're a great resource for. So thank you for your support for them. Y'all will. Chair recognizes representative Rebecca Mitchell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to talk to you about engineering controls. And I specifically want to talk to you about engineering controls from the perspective of a mom of four small children. We really rely on engineering controls to keep us safe in the world, to make the choices that we have a little bit easier. If I take four small children to a playground that has a fence all the way around, I know if they're behind the slide. They're still there. That's an engineering control. This weekend in Snalville, we had an example where we didn't have an engineering control in place that could have made a meaningful difference in the lives of a family in Snalville. This weekend, one family in Snalville had to take a seven-year-old to the hospital for a gunshot wound. That wound was the result of a gun that was not sufficiently secured and was loaded and was picked up by their nine-year-old sibling. We have the ability to prevent more families from experiencing this trauma with an engineering control. That control is in house bill 971 by Representative Scott. I encourage you all to read the bill and think thoughtfully about what we can do to help families be safer from this type of risk. Thank you very much, and I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Edna Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On January 30, 1865, the 13th Amendment of US Constitution was passed by Congress and signed by President Abraham Lincoln. This was the emancipation of the slaves. Richard R. Wright was among those emancipated. He later became the founding president of Georgia State Industrial College for College Youth, now known as Savannah State University. He was the architect and champion of the law signed by President Harry Truman on June 1948, declaring each February 1 as National Freedom Day. This decoration is inclusive of all human beings, regardless of race. We ask that you join us to fight against current law day challenges, the dangers that seek to recast slavery in various forms, such as human trafficking and the right of every citizen to vote. Remember, National Freedom Day was on yesterday in these United States of America. Will you please stand with us in recognition of National Freedom Day? Thank you. What do I say? I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett, Chairman LeHood, and represented to Sharper for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On behalf of the Lounge County delegation, I would invite everyone to the depot this afternoon at 5 p.m. for the Lounge County bird supper. And in recognition of Groundhog Day, I can guarantee you you'll cast a bigger shadow tomorrow. Chair recognizes representative Park and representative Moore for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure and honor to welcome the Gwyneth Chamber to the Georgia State Capitol. Established in 1947 as a rule chamber of commerce, serving farmers, today the Gwyneth Chamber serves more than 2,200 members throughout Metro Atlanta. The Gwyneth Chamber is dedicated to expanding economic opportunities for all and improving our quality of life with a focus on sustainable infrastructure, education and workforce development, revitalization and redevelopment. We have with us this morning, Nick Macino, president of the Gwyneth Chamber, Randy Dillinger from Jackson EMC, Dr. Jan Joseph and Haley Howell from Georgia Gwyneth College, Paul O from the Gwyneth Chamber, Joel Edwards, the 2022 chair, and Nadi Cho from Missy Cosmetics. Members, if you all see members of the Gwyneth Chamber and Gwyneth small business owners out in the hallways, please give them a kind welcome to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For my moment of black history, it's about black history itself. History is the reflection of historical events that took place. But unfortunately, our grade school textbooks do not include the full history. If I said to you all, founding fathers, what comes to your mind? Does someone like me come to your mind? Like you, I was forced to learn and memorize the accomplishments of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson and so many more individuals that do not look like me. But why can't or didn't, I learn about our unsung heroes? Because our black history goes beyond Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. We have more who contribute to this country, like Claudette Caulvin, Alice Coachman, Bayer Rustin, Anna Lee Cooper, Bessie Coleman, Robert Abbott, Gordon Parks, General Benjamin O. Davis Senior, Henrietta Lacks, and many more. But black creative geniuses and critical thinkers who saw so many problems in these United States, but they're not reflected in our textbooks. In order for us to heal from our historical past, our past must be confronted. This is not about critical race theory. This is not about 1619 project. This is about inclusion and truth. This is about confronting the past, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Gentlemen, it has 10 seconds remaining. This moment of black history is about America's history, which is black history. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you do well. Chair recognizes representative Taylor, Chairman Taylor, for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I honor black history a month. I would like to share some information about Jackie Robinson. He was a trailblazer and set many major league records. He was the first African-American in modern Bay, Major League Baseball. And in 1977, our beloved Braves retired his number 44 on the 30th anniversary of him breaking the color barrier. K-Rogue, Georgia, is the birthplace of Jackie Robinson. And we are very proud of that. Robinson was born 13 miles south of K-Rogue on January 34. Before he moved to California. The Jackie Robinson K-Rogue Memorial Institute, along with the Georgia Historical Society, and the Major League Baseball recently dedicated to historical markers in K-Rogue. The markers referenced his birthplace in Grady County. It's actually at County Road 154 south of K-Rogue. And it replaced a marker that had been damaged. We also placed a new one in the library. Together, these two historical markers will allow residents and visitors alike to learn more about one of baseball and America's most important historical figures. Major League Baseball is largely responsible for the two markers being placed in K-Rogue. I think it is important that we remember that which has gone on before us. The endowment will provide a perpetual care for these historical markers. The legacy he has left will live on. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Chair recognizes Representative McLeod for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I'm here to thank the taxpayers of the great state of Georgia. Anyone who pays income tax, sales tax, or occasional fees, to this state, you deserve this body to fund services that will give you a return on investments. Our state budget revenue is about $30 billion. Of that, 76% comes directly from your income and sales tax. 12% comes from corporate taxes. And another 12% comes from fees. Remember, this is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. So we must do right on behalf of the people. One Georgia, I yield the will. That completes our morning orders. Complets morning orders. We are now going on to the rules calendar. We are going on to the rules calendar. Members will give attention. And if you don't care to hear the debate, then please step outside and not distract those who do. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 478. House Bill 478 by President Rich, the 97th and others to be titled an act to men chapter seven, a title to warn. 24th of the fiscal to Georgia, and to add overlaying opinions and expert testimony. Ms. Bill lemmer, for the committee on judiciary non-civil, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Bonnie Rich to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Today I bring to you House Bill 478. House Bill 478 updates the Georgia rules of evidence to require the same standard for admitting expert testimony in criminal cases as is used in civil cases. This important change is supported by the legal community. In fact, all of the major stakeholders in the community who work with us here at the Capitol are in agreement. We have the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Prosecuting Attorney's Council, GTLA and NADL, the National Association of Defense Lawyers. Since 1993, federal courts, including those in Georgia, have used in both civil and criminal cases the standard as set forth in the United States Supreme Court case of Dobert versus Merrill Dow. This case sets the trial judge up as the gatekeeper and provides a list and it's not an exhaustive list. It provides a list of factors that the judge is to consider and determining the admissibility of scientific evidence and expert testimony now too. Some of those factors include whether the theory or the technique has been tested, whether it's been peer reviewed and published, any error rate, the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation, and finally, whether it has widespread acceptance in the scientific community. That latter factor is currently the only standard that we have in criminal cases in Georgia. Even beyond 1993, Georgia did continue to use this old Harper versus the state standard, which is a 1982 case for the admission of scientific evidence in both civil and criminal cases. This standard simply requires that scientific evidence reach only a verifiable stage of certainty without regard for reliability. The General Assembly took up an extensive tort reform package in 2005 and as part of that, we passed legislation which applies the dogurt standard in civil cases. Unfortunately, we continue to use the old Harper standard in our criminal cases even to this day. And sadly, this is resulted in the use of unreliable scientific evidence which has resulted in wrongful convictions. According to the National Registry of Exoneration, we've had 39 documented exoneration in Georgia over the last 30 years. And at least 25 of those wrongful convictions were due at least in part to faulty scientific evidence that was admitted under the Harper standard. That means that 64% of our wrongful convictions have been based on faulty evidence. Those 25 people, those 25 Georgians lost over 312 years of their lives and cost Georgia taxpayers well over $6.2 million. It does not reflect our Georgia values that it is more difficult to get expert testimony included in a case about money and property than it is about life and liberty. House Bill 478 will stop that and will bring Georgia's evidence code up to the standard it should be. Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions. You have some questions. Do you care to yield? Yes, I do. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just lay the yield. I do. Hopefully this is just my misunderstanding. But I just looked quickly at 24-7-702 which seems to be the section that we're amending according to the presentation to change the standards in criminal cases but 24-7-702 is in the civil section. That is in the civil section and let's see. Let's make sure we're working off of the right LC number. This LC441884S is that what we have here? Yes, that's okay. Okay. Okay. Do you further yield? Yes, I do. Chair recognizes representative Wolenski to your left for a question. He waves. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't generate a yield. I do. I'm not a lawyer, so I'm just asking this for clarification. What's the difference between civil proceedings and criminal proceedings? Well, civil proceedings are lawsuits over money damages or property rights and criminal proceedings are just that they're criminal proceedings based on whether someone has committed a crime. Does the lady further yield? Yes. Are there any other types of proceedings or are there only just those two civil or criminal? With respect to the rules of evidence, yes, there are just two broad categories of civil and criminal. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, unless we have other questions, I will yield the well. I'm making sure the representative Clark, were you finished? Okay. Mr. Speaker, I request favorable consideration of House Bill 478 and I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is now in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is now in the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is now in the report of the committee. Is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 478 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative McLaren rise? Parliament or any criminal speaker? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this bill is the happiest I've literally ever been in a House judiciary non-civil committee? You have a very low standard of happiness with the gentlemen so states actually when I chaired that committee I was thrilled to be there every day representative. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I feel the same way. Thank you. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Yes so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 478 the eyes are 138. The nays are 25. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 907. House Bill 907, I'm Smith to the 18th and others to be entitled and act to amend. Go to section 212, 540 the fiscal to draw janitor relating to conduct with special primaries and special elections generally. This bill had refer the committee on government affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Tyler Paul Smith to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning members of this August body. It's good to be with you this morning. Today I bring to you House Bill 907. House Bill 907 will deal with a problem that we have encountered here in our state especially with what we call single county T-splice designees. For these single county T-splice designees, when they originally passed their T-splice referendum, allowing them to collect these revenues, they had to set a cap. What we have seen thanks to this body having passed the marketplace facilitator bill and this unexpected robust economy that we have seen in the last two years, a lot of these counties are nearing those caps. My home county of Herylson County reached that cap as of last year. In the current code section dealing with special elections, you would have to wait until May in an off presidential year to call this referendum. This would allow for counties to call a special election on the third Tuesday of March. What I will note and I have discussed with several members and I appreciate all the questions I have had from each member that has come to me with it. This will sunset on July 1, 2024. If a county were to encounter say that they are capped amount of what they could collect, they admit that they either have this March or the next March in which to call this special election. This is a good bill. I will note that my home county, if they were to have to wait until the May election, they could potentially lose out on several million dollars worth of revenue. To our small rural and frankly poor counties, that kind of money is huge. And I will just share with you the burden that has to be born on taxes that would usually go to the property owners. So this transportation tax, if this house were to pass it, it would help these rural communities and not losing any more revenue than what they already have. Mr. Speaker, I will yield for any questions if there are any. Do you yield for questions? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, yield for my friend, for a question. I followed you very closely and it points you both stony and accent kind of threw me off. But I did want to say I support your bill, principal, and I see what you're doing. And it has some very good points. I'm only concerned. I stated in rules and it's a concern. It's not big enough for me to vote against the bill, but the turnout is representative of the overall population. But I've heard that because of the size of your bank rule, you're going to see that there was a great turnout in March. Yes, sir. That is correct. And, you know, this is upon the county to make sure that they advertise that this is something that we need. And to be clear, for my home county, it's not going to be a tax increase. It's just going to continue this tax. What you would have to do in the event that you shut down those, you have to change the machines that collect that tax. You can no longer collect that tax.\n\nand so it's even a burden on business owners in these different counties throughout our state. Thank you for the question. You further you? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson up in the gallery, I think. For a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? Yes, sir. I'm referring to him. I'm clarified, so your bill will have the voting precincts open in March in order for citizens of Georgia to go and vote for this T-splots. If that particular county called this special election, yes, or they would be open for that. Does the gentleman further you? One more, yes, sir. So if the whole discussion around voting, is to minimize the cost to Georgians, why wouldn't your bill be aligned when we will have voting such as in May, which will not incur additional costs? Because now you have to train the public at large that they simply have to go and vote in March for a T-splots when we do not do the same effort for them to cast their vote for their representatives of choice in May. So thank you for the question. The cost of this election is born by the county like the gentleman states. I think you'll see the revenues collected will more than make up for the money spent on that special referendum election. Thank you for the question. Do you further you? Miss Speaker, I'll take one more and then I think I'm going to be done. Okay, Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mrs. Clark. Thank you, Mrs. Youngerman. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker, does the gentleman you? For a question, yes. So you mentioned that this will only be for the next two years. So this seems like this legislation is very much tailored to something very specific that you want. Is that correct? Well, there are several, there's actually around 40 counties that can very well find themselves in this same situation as in addition to my home county. Because I mean, look, the economy's doing great. If they were to hit that cap, they would then be able to call that special referendum to raise the cap to continue collecting that T-Splash revenue. All right, that's a gentleman further you? One more. If you, or if this bill were to pass, and for today is February 2nd, and if this bill were to pass, and then go to the other chamber and pass there, and then the governor were to sign this immediately, would your election officials in your county have time to administer an entire election, and then turn around and administer a second election less than two months later? Yes, they would. We've got the timeline and the deadline down, and they are fully prepared to implement this if we're able to pass this great bill. Thank you for answering the question. Thank you. Miss Speaker, with that, I will yield the well and ask this body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. The number is voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 907. The eyes are 137. The nays are 29. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The bill has been passed as representative Tyler Paul Smith rise to make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker, I move the House Bill 907 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Representative Smith has moved that House Bill 907 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Is there objection to the chair here's none? It is so ordered. Clerk will read the caption to agree with privilege and resolutions. I remember a lot. Memorizing the Mr. Amard Marquez Arbery.
