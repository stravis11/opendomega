  "transcript": "Get a little quiet out there. It's getting a little loud in here. I know we got some anxious folks and\nFirst off let me start by saying\nIf you have already come here and presented your bill, you do not need to do it again\nIf you won't tell you can\nBut for sake of time if you have already presented your bill, you do not need to go again\nSo if anybody has other things they want to do or need to do, feel free to leave and exit\nnow.\nSeeing none.\nWell, for all y'all standing, I tried to help you out.\nNow, another rule, since this is rules committee, I like rules.\nAs you present today, you do not need to come back.\nWe'll hold one more rolls committee.\nIt will either be tomorrow night or it will be Friday morning.\nThat's going to be kind of dependent on the Senate schedule tomorrow.\nWe're going in at 1 o'clock tomorrow and depending how fast we move through bills,\nwe'll kind of determine when rules will meet.\nAnd I'll make that decision fairly early in the day.\nSo rules committee, y'all just stand by.\nWe're really going to meet early evening tomorrow\nduring a recess, or we will meet at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.\nAnd again, house members, if you present today,\nyou will not need to come back and present again.\nOr if you have already presented,\nyou do not need to come back and present again.\nNow, for you house members that are new to this,\nUnder normal circumstances, I make the bills available.\nSo that is the yellow sheet you're looking at.\nThose bills are available for the committee to be picked.\nBut the committee numbers are the ones that pick the bills.\nAgain, that's under normal circumstances.\nToday is going to be an exception of that rule,\nbecause I'm actually going to set the calendar\ntomorrow with about 17 bills.\nand then the rest, when we come back in,\nrules committee members, you're gonna have about two to three,\npossibly even four picks, when we come back in,\neither tomorrow night or Friday morning, okay?\nSo just giving everybody a heads up.\nSo House members, lobby the committee members.\nLobby them, because they are the ones\nthat will pick your bills outside of today.\nI'm gonna pick them today,\nbecause there's a lot of department bills we're trying to get on the floor\ntomorrow so they don't get caught up and cross over and a few other bills\nwe're trying to get on the floor tomorrow so I'm sorry for signing by signing\ndie all right so that's kind of the groundwork so let's go through first we're\ngoing to we're in standing committee all right we're going to briefly go\nWe're going through our study committees.\nAll right, so starting out, Senator James, you got SR-37.\nAll right, go for it, give me one sentence on it.\nSR-37, Senate Property Owners Association,\nHome Owners Association,\nCondominium Associations, any questions?\nNo. All right.\nNext SR 85 Senator Walker\nPerfect\nSR 121 Senator Butler.

committee on foster care and adoption.\nI like it.\nAll right, Senate Resolution 286, Senator Beech.\nYeah, this is to create a study committee to look at minority business, women, business, and\nveteran owns, but I will tell you, we have House Bill 128 on the calendar, which really kind of has done this.\nSo do we need to pull this off?\nYeah, I mean, there's no need for it if House Bill 128 passes to Representative Long's Bill.\nAssuming it gets picked.\nIf it gets picked and passes, then we would not need this study committee.\nWe're moving on for now.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nSenator resolution 293, Senator Halperen.\nOkay.\nIn fact, you got 293 and 296, go ahead and cover them both please.\n293 is a study committee that would look at an equity impact tools and it would just\nlook at equity impacts and what we might be able to do as it relates to legislation.\nThis is, here equity you think raised generally, but this really is looking at disparities\nand it could also be impacts and unintended consequences\non our rural areas versus urban.\nAbout 296.\nAnd 296 is a subject.\nNot to cut you off, but I'm going to cut you off.\n296, excessive noise.\nWe still have an issue with loud mufflers, loud music.\nAnd so this would be figuring out what the state could do\nto help our people solve this.\nAnd in this room.\nCan we have this room?\nYes, but that's it.\nEverybody's behaving nicely.\nAll right, thank you, Senator.\nSenator Matarte, 314.\nMike number one, 314 is a Solar Study Committee\nand apologize I was late.\nSenator Resolution 155 was a

working with the FDA\nand the Centers for Disease Control.\nGotcha.\nAll right, so here's what we could do if it's the will of the committee we can pass this onto a local consent calendar if there's any resolution any study committee anyone wants to pull off they can make that motion once we have a motion on the table for the consent calendar or is there any actually before I make is there anyone that would like to pull one off for individual consideration?\nOkay, all right, which one's what's your number there for?\nIt's in one of the most important ones.\nIt's and I don't see it in front of us.\nIt's a study committee on study committees.\nHave you looked at it?\nIf we adopt all of these, we'll be here all year.\nYou don't have to serve on all of them.\nI know, but if anything you'd like to pull off,\nnow would be the proper time to do that.\nAnd then we will vote on those individuals.\nWe go to make each one individually or just do it.\nWe just did.\nWe are going to pass on to a local consent calendar\nof resolutions creating study committees.\nAnything you would like to pull off of that consent calendar\nnow would be the proper time.\nAnd I will take that motion.\nAnd then we will have an individual vote on each.\neach, Senator Diggin, you have a question.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, number two.\nNumber two.\nSo if we pass it to a local consent calendar,\nwe can still challenge on the floor\nto have it removed from the local consent calendar\nand vote for it individually.\nAll right.\nI said local consent calendar.\nIt's just a consent calendar, but my understanding is,\nthat we could do it, we could do it on the floor as well,\nbut since we're getting,\nI would pull off as many as you can at this point,\nif that's what you want.\ntrying to say if you see something but yes you're saving time now but we're\ngoing it's going to hurt us later yes question center albers thank you\nMr. Chairman are we in the standing committee we're in the standing committee at\nthis time so isn't it true if we pass all these they still then have to go and\nbe redone for a consent on the rules committee once their passes and that\ntrue that is we have another step to do still that is correct they would pass\nout they would go to the rules calendar so if we just pass these now we'd have\nsome time before you put them into the rules committee to figure out which\nWe might want a moment. They're going to be in the rules committee as soon as we get out of standing, which is going to be momentarily\nI'm sorry it will be tomorrow\nThank you. I'm sorry. I'm learning the rules too\nAll right\nWhat is the will of the committee?\nAh chairman Walker\nI have a parliamentary inquiry.\nOkay.\nIs it not true that even if we were to pass all of these on the floor of the Senate,\nit's still at the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor whether or not to appoint the committee.\nYou know, you being a former four-lative Lieutenant Governor, you would know that best.\nAnd I think that is a great point to bring up to the committee.\nAll of these to be appointed up. I wouldn't it be unusual\nFair enough to keep that mind committee now back in my\nRegional question. What's the world committee? I got a motion do pass to the consent calendar of resolutions\nCreating study committees. I've got a second any further discussion\nI'm sure you know what to do.\nAll right, all right, keep them up.\nWe'll get a count.\nWe're going to have some of what we got.\nYeah, he's getting the shaper wave left hand count to\nAll right, all the pays raise your hand\nGachandolls all the riff raff for the Senate\nWhich one are you riffing he's raff?\nI just didn't want to.\nAll right, motion passed.\nAll right, this meeting is adjourned.\nNew meeting is start.\nWait, what?\nD pass.\nOh, oh, oh, oh.\nWhat?\nResolution 186.\nI'm sorry, meeting was not adjourned.\nThat was a false alarm.\nWe did not have Senate Resolution 186,\ncommending the Georgia Federation a Democratic woman.\nThat one actually is separate because it's not a study committee.\nWhat is the world of committee?\nYou got a motion do pass from Senator Robertson and second\nfrom Senator Dugan.\nAll in favor?\nSay aye.\nAll opposed?\nSame sign?\nMotion passes unanimous.\nThose will all go on to Rolls Committee tomorrow\nAll right, thank you all right now means adjourn and we will call this next meeting to order\nWe are now in rules and we will go to the general calendar and\nRules consideration calendar your yellow sheet\nHouse members.

Okay, what was your other one? 470? Yeah, yes sir.\nAll right, fourth page, three fourths the way down. Thank you sir. This is one\nthat perhaps made the capital shake last week. We had agreement between the\nThe trial lawyers, the hospitals, the doctors, the insurers, it's a new way, just one small\nway of doing something differently in trying to resolve in a positive way when patients\nhave unintended unexpected consequences happen to them without involving the legal system.\nIt's totally voluntary between patients and the hospital or the doctor and the hospital\none.

I bring you House Bill 317.\nThis is a bill that has to do with the retirement plan for some, it's an old plan that the\nstate has. And for some reason, they did not allow an assignment of life insurance benefits\nto the funeral home. And funeral homes have been left without their\nbill being paid and this allows them to accept an assignment for the funeral expenses.\n317 is not on the yellow sheet but she can go ahead and present one of the\nissues were because it is a pension plan but once the beneficiary once the\nemployee has deceased it's the beneficiary's money so the state as we leave\nthey're doing what the beneficiary wants and assigning the benefits.

I ain't bad.\nHouse Bill 80, I presented a few days ago and I'm assuming you don't wish to hear that again.\nNope.\nAll right.\nThen House Bill 220, without getting into the legalities of it, it basically would require\nHOAs and condominium associations to go to court first before they go on to property\nto cure any kind of deficiencies.\nAnd then House Bill 227 creates a new crime of damage to critical infrastructure.\nIt makes it a subset of criminal damage to property.\nAnd the first degree increases the penalty.\nThis is for folks who damage power substations and things like happen in North Carolina\nback just before Christmas.\nOkay. Any questions? Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nCome on down.\nGood afternoon.

Thank you.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nBring you today's substitute to House Bill 244.\nThis is a Department of Natural Resources Bill.\nYou don't need to worry about it a bit,\nbecause it came through Senator Lee Anderson's committee,\nwhich means it's thoroughly vetted.\nAnd this bill is about four years ago,\nI carried the Oyster-Merry Culture Bill.\nMost of this is some improvements there related to defining cages\nfor new technology with growing oysters.\nWe also have some language in here allowing the governor\nthe governor to replace board members like they do in other boards across the state.\nAnd we actually also in here allow, as you'll notice, electronically calling Fox and Bob\nCat in this state as during hunting season for those species.\nOkay.\nSo your oyster bill, the original oyster bill, if I remember correctly, at a house member\ntest five against it and if I remember the number right, he kept saying 37 members\nand the House voted against it.\nI can't remember that, I can't remember that.\nI know we had a member on the coast to actually\noppose that measure.\nWell he was basically enough.\nI had to remind him 37 wasn't enough.\nYes, that's right, not quite enough.\nIt's a good bill, and by the way,\nanybody interested, we are only awaiting the Corps\nof Engineers approval.\nFederal bureaucracy is the only thing keeping us\nfrom farming oysters in Georgia at this very minute.\nWe're still waiting, and we have been for quite some time.\nAll right, well thank you.\nThank you Chairman.\nAll right.\nRepresentative Dempsey.\nCome on up.\nMy mama would be enjoying this if she was watching.\nIn fact, maybe.\nMaybe she can go back and watch us, OK?\nShe'd probably watch it, actually.\nJust her buys information.\nI was in high school with the chairman's mother.\nWe graduated together.\nAnd I was in college with her daughter.\nYeah, and I'll work down in it.\nYes.\nHere we are.\nSo here we are today.\nPage three, the fifth one down.\nThe Senate substitute to HB228, this is a great opportunity\nfor several of our colleges and a university\nthat were not eligible for tuition equalization grants\nback in 2011 when 33 schools were grandfathered\nin to that program.\nIt allows in section two, it allows for two HBCUs\nto be considered, Penn College and Mars Brown College\nin section three, South College, which was\nSenator Burns bill that passed out of here and was just being heard again over in House\nHigher Education. And then in section four is the underlying bill for Chamberlain University.\nThey each address critical shortages in our state to help with the education process\nas well as particularly the nursing shortage. So, my whole takeaway from your presentation\nwas I heard you saying the house is actually taking up some of our bills, so I'm glad\nWe are and I I mean, I'm just like I'm here. I will tell you this at Senator Burns came to pitch this to y'all\nBecause we didn't have a quorum and then the quorum was reached at that moment\nSo we're looking out for you. Yes, he yelled at us.
