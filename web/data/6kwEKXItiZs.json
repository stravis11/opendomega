Please join me in welcoming to the Georgia Senate floor, a man of great faith, vision, and purpose, even my pastor, Dr. E. Dewey Smith Jr. Thank you, Dr. Pastor. Dr. Smith. Certainly, Mr. President and Senator Mangum and the distinguished members of this body. So, Joe, an privilege to have an opportunity to share with you on today. And I was meditating and thinking about what I could share that could be of impact and reflection for each of you. As we think about government, I believe that God ordained an instituted government. And a specific body, the Children of Israel, had a precarious predicament in which God wanted to lead them from a theoretical perspective, but they wanted monarchy rule and God allowed them to acquess, and God acquests their request to move them from theocracy to monarchy. And so King Saul and King David and King Solomon were the premier monarchs of Israel's history. The fourth king was a gentleman whose name was Rehoboan. And it was during Rehoboam's reign and that the nation of Israel, which had a prior history of schisms, began to really face insurmountable division where clarity and moral courage was needed. And so during that time, Rehoboam made some decisions and made some decisions that think our decisions that we should examine within our own lives, and particularly as you make laws for this great state. Rehoboam made some critical decisions that fostered the division and fostered the negativity for Israel and led to some circumstances which were not able to be fixed appropriately. Rehoboam, in 2 Chronicles chapter 10, does three things that affect Israel in a negative way from a governmental perspective. First thing that Rehoboam did that I want to challenge you and challenge all of us not to do is that he failed to follow prudent advice. As he was trying to make a decision about the unity of Israel, and how Israel could move with forward dispatch, unfortunately, as he sought direction from those sages, from those who had been around Israel, and they offered him advice and offered him some suggestions based upon the experience, based upon their service with King Solomon, based upon their knowledge of previous administrations, and Rehoboam failed to listen to the sage advice. We have to be careful that each generation that comes about, that although innovation and iteration are important, it's also important that we don't just discard those who've solidified what we do our systems, seeming that there is this attempt to want to just discard those who have gone before us. We must understand this great state has been around for a very long time, and to just discard those who've lay foundation would be problematic and dangerous for our state. So he failed to follow prudent advice, but then secondly, he was focused on pride in his arrogance. Instead of listening to the wisdom of the sages and those who served, those who had experienced, he surround himself with his own colleagues, who were youthful, who amateurs and neophytes. And instead of listening to the sages, he listened to those who had their own self-interest. And they told him to not pay attention to the advice of the sages. They told him to be about your own pride, and they made him feel more significant about himself than he should have. He listened to the wrong people, and as a consequence, the controversial Israel increased the more. The third thing that he did was not only did he not follow prudent advice, and not only was he following and focused on his own pride and arrogance. He wanted to be puffed up. But the third thing that he did is that he foolishly increased the people's adversity. They went to him to talk about some of the issues, some of the challenges of the previous administration, taxes and other eels that had been perpetrated by his father, King Solomon. But instead of listening, instead of trying to come to happy medium, what Rehoboam did, he said to the people, as he listened to the words of the neophytes, he said, my father may have disciplined, disciplined you with whips, but I'm going to discipline you with scorpions. And so instead of trying to alleviate and bring people together, he made the peoples adversity even more difficult. As a consequence, in 931 BC, the nation of Israel split in 20, and with the 10 Northern tribes choosing the new King, whose name was Jeroboam, and Rehoboam being subjected to the two Southern tribes, the nation of Israel split, a war of such because of improper leadership by Rehoboam. And so today, I want to challenge you to not be Rehoboam. I want to challenge you to not allow political expediency or your party affiliation to make you get away from principle. I want to challenge you today to not allow your constituency and to not allow being liked to make you forget about the things that are principle and the things that you know are right in your heart. Because each of us, one day, will have to stand before a great judge who will not only judge us for our laws, but judges for our decisions. And so, preferably, to you today, that you can stand with more courage and more conviction and regardless of your political affiliation, that you do what you know is right. Not in the sight of those who just will elect you to office, but do it right inside of what you know is best for the state as a whole. And best of what will allow you to sleep at night. And so walk in peace, walk in victory. Thank you for your service. May God bless you and may God bless this great state of Georgia. God bless you. Eternal God, how thankful are we for the privilege to serve in government. Thank you that you've given government to prevent anarchy and to bring order. And now, Lord, as we have been charged and tasked with the difficult assignment of bringing people together, regardless of location, regardless of faith, regardless of gender, regardless of belief, regardless of race or ethnicity, Lord, we pray that as we try to merge to form a better and more beloved society. Thank you for Mr. President. Thank you all of the senators and all of the staff. Now, would you bring us together in these difficult times, these difficult times of varied opinions we ask for your peace, even when they are difficult, when they are difficult as, even when they are different disagreements, would you allow us to be principled? Would you allow us to have character indignated and a genuine respect and regard for the other? Help us to not only speak, but be willing to listen. Help us to communicate in a way that honors you that brings civility to this house, but also sets an example for our young people who are watching. We need your peace. We need civility. Bring us reconciliation. We ask these things as we expect all of the faiths. We ask these things now in Jesus' name. Keep us and give us peace. Amen. Amen. Are there any, uh, uh? you you you you you you you you you\n\nWealth of knowledge to women's health for metro and rural areas. So with that, I'll introduce Dr. Kesha Calin. Good morning. I'm going to try again. Good morning. That's better. Today is a very important day and I want to start off by just saying thank you for your service to our state. Thank you for the opportunity to allow me to be here today. I'm in the medical aid station with Nurse Mack. If you have any issues or concerns, I'm happy to help. I am an OBGYN, but if you're a guy, I can probably break protocol and help you. So don't be scared to come by because I'm an OBGYN. So just a couple of quick words I want to leave with you. I heard someone speak recently and they said, be the change, lead the change and see the change. And I think that's just very, it captures exactly what we need to do. I'll leave with one thought. This is by Chancellor Kirby Gossi from Mercer University School of Medicine. Actually just Mercy University. We are here to give people hope to be our light amidst the shadows, to teach and to live out grace. And I think that captures exactly what we need to do. Whether we're serving in the legislator, we're serving in medicine, serving in the community. We're here to help each other. So with that, I thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Thank you. Recognize the majority later. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the Senate rules three dash 1.2 and four dash 2.1 paragraph A be suspended to allow for the first reading and assignment of six Senate bills. Well, you know, you get to me a little later, aren't you, Senator? Yeah. All right. The Senator's move. There is objection. The Senator's move that we suspend the rules, the read by bills, six bills and assign them to a committee. All right. We have objection. Is it objection Senator? Okay. All right. So we have objection. All those, all those in favor of objecting to the rules will vote. Yay. I'll pose an A secretary and lock the machine. All the minister in inquiry. Part of maternity inquiry. Isn't it true that a green vote will allow these bills to be read in today? Senator, Senator knows what he speaks. All right. All the motion, the yays are 29. The nays are 22. The nays are 29. Secretary Reed. So you had to have two thirds. You have to have two thirds of the motion failed. Senator in front of the 44. Thank you, Mr. President. I was just going to point out that the motion failed. All right. We've got a special presentation here today. I know we usually don't do special presentations, but this is a special moment here for one of our members. So if the beach family could come up here to the roster, it would be great. I'm going to be the senator. I'm going to break the rules. Don't vote. Don't challenge the chair on this. Senator, this is going to be Senator Brandon Beach's last day here in this body. He is served for 13 years now here in this senate body. The members got elected together. We wrote freshman. He came in in a special election, I believe. So he came in a little bit late. And all I ever heard about throughout the state was this man that served on the DOT board named Brandon Beach. And when I heard so much about what a unbelievable person he was, what a public servant he was, what a powerful individual he was from North Fulton County. I just knew I was going to meet a man six foot five that looked like Superman. But Beach has been a great great friend to me and to others in this room. And his family has been very, very good to our families, Chantelle and Jan, have a special relationship. So I want to, I want to, the secretary to read a resolution. I'm going to let the senator from the 27th. Say a few words and then we have a parting gift for him here. So secretary, read the caption. Senate resolution 540 by Senator Dole is all the 27th and others. A resolution applauding Senator Brandon Beach for his exceptional service in the Georgia Senate. His leadership in both public and private sectors and congratulating him on his recent appointment as United States treasure in the current Trump administration and further purposes. Whereas Senator Brandon Beach has served the people of Georgia with distinction for over two decades serving as a senator representing the 21st district. And whereas Senator Beach has held several influential positions in the Senate including his service as the chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and as chairman of the Senate Economic Development and Tourism Committee. And in various other committees including the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate Rules Committee, the Senate Ethics Committee. Whereas Senator Beach's background outside of the Senate has been equally impressive with a successful career in business during which he has owned and operated multiple companies and has held key leadership roles including serving on the boards of Georgia Regional Transport Authority and the Georgia Department of Transportation. And whereas Senator Beach's integrity approach to problem solving and commitment to public services earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues in constituents as well as the recognition as a strong leader in Georgia politics. And whereas Senator Beach's exemplary leadership and dedication to the people of Georgia were recognized on a national scale when he was appointed by President Trump to serve as the United States treasure. And whereas as the first Georgia to serve in this capacity, Senator Beach will continue to demonstrate the same commitment to public service financial stewardship and integrity that defined his career in the Georgia Senate. Now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body honor and applaud Senator Brandon Beach for his exceptional service to the state of Georgia, his remarkable career in both public and private sectors and his outstanding contributions to the nation's financial policy. As well as to congratulate him on his appointment as Treasury of the United States. Mr. President that completes the order. His objection to adoption resolution chair here's nine and the resolution is about. Recognize the center from the 27th speaks to the resolution. Thank you Mr. President and colleagues. All of us know and love Brandon. All of us have a Brandon story. And I was driving to dinner last night with Brandon and he in a moment of vulnerability said, don't listen, I think I'm making the right decision to leave. And I said, absolutely. He said, I know that I am, but I'm just going to miss the Senate so much. And I just encouraged him. I said, you know, you can judge people's service by how something is different versus how it was when they arrived. And the state is different. The city of Alpharetta is different. I think about the phenomenal work that Brandon has done locally. The way that he worked within the North Fulton Chamber of Commerce started in North Fulton CID, now the true North CID. But a lot of the little things that people don't necessarily know about the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater is a 13,500 person amphitheater in the city of Alpharetta. And the city of Alpharetta would not exist today. We're not for Brandon and about three other people. When you drive up Georgia 400, you see other municipalities copying what they did on Encore Parkway with the bridges that span over 400 that now have the beautiful stone facade. Brandon pioneered that idea, championed that idea, found the funding for that idea, did it as a singular bridge and literally now multiple municipalities across 400 up and down 400 are doing the same thing. Copying his work in the Senate. He was a champion for a lot of things, not the least of which was transportation funding or road infrastructure. But the biggest thing that I am changed about as it relates to Brandon is the way that for me he has demonstrated loyalty. When he is with you, he is with you for a better or worse. And that is something that I have been the personal benefactor of and something that he has modeled for me as I've watched him do that for many of you as well. But really I think if you really want to judge a man and if you really want to look, I think what Brandon is crowning achievement as you look at his family. His wife, Shantel, 41 years, Natalie and I have had the opportunity to have dinner with them on numerous occasions and you can just tell they love each other. His two children, his shocking, is it may seem, or completely normalized? Well adjusted adults. I am hearing lots of credit at the Shantel up here at the Rossstrom. But Hunter and Courtney are phenomenal. His son-in-law calls him dad. David Clark who serves across the hall and the other chamber because Brandon has welcomed him into the family of the open arms. And if you have ever had the opportunity to listen to him talk about one of his five grandchildren or seeing the way that they respond to him. You know that that is the crowning achievement of his career. So Brandon has been an honor for each of you, every one of us to serve with you. Governor, I know we have a very, very special presentation. You'd like to share a few words as well. But Brandon thank you for the friend you've been to me, the model that you've been in this chamber so many of us and Governor, I'll let you close it out here with your presentation. I'm going to give you our little gift after you speak because I know you're going to get all teary-eyed here. So we want to see them flow in here at the end. So when you be smiling. So Senator Bees, let's give Senator Bees a big round of applause. Thank you all. You know, I'm not an emotional person but I am overwhelmed today. I thank you. I walked in this building 13 years ago, a guy from New Orleans that got elected to the state Senate and I've been in awe of this institution ever since. We do great work here and I want to thank my wife and my children. I couldn't do this without family. Everybody that sits in this room, your family takes a sacrifice for you to sit here. And I want to thank them. But I want to also tell you that I love this institution. I love the General Assembly, but I love the state Senate. Thank you for the resolution, the Senator from the 27th. Burt, you're my dear friend and I look forward to you continuing to do great things for the state of Georgia. And I just want to tell you, thank you. It's, I drove in this morning and again, I'm not an emotional guy, but I got in caucus and I had a little tear in my when I said goodbye to the caucus knowing that it was my last day here. But I want you to know I'm going to go to, I'm never going to figure it where I came from. I love this institution. And I'm going to go up, I'm the first Treasury United States from the state of Georgia since 1775. And I want to let you know. I want to let you know I'm going to go up there and represent the state of Georgia and do a good job for you guys. And my name will be on the money. So when you get that, you'll like that. It's called Beach Bucks. I like it. But anyway, thank you all very much. I love you guys. I love this Senate and keep doing great work for the state of Georgia. And let's keep doing great things. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you Senator. I appreciate that. And I can I can assure you you if you ever want to have a friend that will get into trenches with you and fight the good fight with your brand, brand and beaches. Is that guy? And I can tell you he tore his shirt tail. Chris Cross in the state for me when I ran for lieutenant governor, which I had no, I had no, I really had no vision of running for lieutenant governor. I'll be honest with you. But, but we had a little disagreement a few years ago, some folks who were in leadership and and they decided to put isolate myself and Brandon. And so I said, you know what? I think I will run. And Brandon, I know we've got midway through the election. And he was going to some event that on my behalf. And he said, he said, come on. Can you go? I had some event that you canceled it. He said, come on up here. I'll come to the event. And he says, I go, I said, I'm tired beach. You know, I don't know if I do it today. He said, let me tell you something. He goes, you the only thing I got right now. I will ride you like a mule. Make sure. Make sure you get across the finish line because you don't win. I'm in trouble. But, but Brandon's been, Brandon's been great to serve with and he has been a good brand and the caucus appreciates everything that he's done. And I will tell you the caucus pulled together and got him a very special gift. And he's assured every one of us that he's going to, he's going to wear it to his all his brand new office and watching in DC the first day he arrived. And Brandon, I hope you like it as much as we like it. But it is a custom-made jacket right here. There we go. Beach box. Beach box. Thank you all. Hey, and in closing, I do want to thank the staff of everybody staff. Thank you for my staff for Florian and Brad and Lieutenant Governor staff. We don't do this by ourselves. It's the staff helps us and thank you guys for all y'all do. Thank you very much. Love you guys. Go Georgia. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ready? Ready? . . . . .\n\nactivist, giant of the movement who risked everything so that we could stand here today, free to lift our voices and demand a better tomorrow. Yes, I stand on his shoulders and on the shoulders of so many. Dr. Keen's dream didn't die in Memphis. It lives on in the hearts and souls of those who believe in justice, equality, and non-violence. He lives on in our actions. When we pass laws that lift people up, when we fight for affordable housing, when we fight for equality, education, and for dignity on every zip code, that's when he smiles from heaven. So as a senator, I carried that dream with me. The dream that he said he looked over and he saw the problems land. He made that speech the day before he died, before he was assassinated. He said he did see it, so the problems land exists. And I carried it with me until every committee meeting that I go to, every vote, every neighborhood I visit, every church that I attend. So let us not mourn for his death today without recommitting to his mission. Let us build the beloved community that he gave his life for. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther Keen, I salute you and everything that you stood for. Thank you. I yield the will. Thank you, senator. We're going to have a senator from the night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to echo what some of the senator from the 28th just presented. Today is the 57th anniversary of the assassination of an American civil rights leader, the honorable Dr. Martin Luther Keen, Jr. Fade in shot April 14, 1968 at the Lorraine Botell in Memphis, Tennessee. I made a request as chair of the Georgia legislative black caucus members to wear black today to memorialize his death and to acknowledge the tragedy of losing. One of America's greatest advocates for social justice and also the protest in justices that are happening here in Georgia as well as nationwide. Across the nation, we have seen a coordinated attack on black history and institutions that are extremely important to the black community as a whole. And unfortunately, these national issues have been brought to the state of Georgia and it is disappointing. Republican in this chamber have made decisions worth mourning. We mourn the loss of respect for diversity in favor of embracing racist ideologies. We mourn the loss of the respect for humanity in favor of hating immigrants, bullying the LGBT community, and denying those with serious healthcare issues, medical coverage, and selling out our citizens in favor of big business and big money. Dismantering our democracy, worthy of mourning, there is nothing worse celebrating in this chamber today besides we're ending. I hope this body will take a different approach to solving problems and selling different disagreements today. A better one than what we saw on Wednesday as Republicans in this body couldn't even bring the fight to us properly and cut and run instead of allowing us to represent those voices that we represent back home and stay here. If you're going to put a bad bill here, stay here and fight us on it. Even if it took all night. Today we should carry the spirit of Dr. King and keep his legacy in mind as we bear the task of making decisions that will impact 11 million people who live in this state. People I love in a state that I love and I'm very disappointed by what has been happening this session. And we must use this day, this final day of the 2025 legislative session and try to cooperate and pass legislation that will actually substantially improve the lives of all of our constituents. And with that Mr. President, I yield well. I've got a special guest here. I'd like to just quickly introduce to the chamber here. We have our new labor commissioner here, Miss Barbara Holmes from down in Albany, Georgia. So let's give Commissioner Holmes a warm welcome here. Well, good morning everyone. I am delighted to be here. And thank you for allowing me just a moment to bring brief remarks and just to share a little bit about what we'll be doing together. I'm honored to serve as your new labor commissioner and Georgia's first Latina constitutional officer. What I'm really excited about is working with you to move the Department of Labor into a new era. One that fosters collaboration, increases service delivery and really delivers for Georgia. And so we're going to be doing that work together. And I'm just thrilled to be part of what I call team Georgia. I know that you are as well. We have 800 professionals throughout the state that are dedicated to that mission. And so you can count on us to lead that department into a new era and to deliver for Georgia. And we're going to be with you and I hope you'll be with us today tomorrow and 26 and beyond that so that we continue doing this great work together. And if you're not busy, I think everybody's busy today. But if you're not busy at three, I hope that you'll swing by the north steps for the official swing. And again, look forward to working with each of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I rise today still really from what we did on Wednesday. And since I wasn't able to speak to the bill, that was abruptly cut off in the middle of the night. I want to share a few words about the fact that we sent a bill over to the house that prevents efforts to combat racism. We discussed this in committee and made the most minor of amendments in case you did not notice. In the bill, it says that they cannot promote anti-racism with a capital A now. Originally, it was a lowercase A. I would argue that in the year 2025, we should not be arguing whether or not a lowercase A or capital A has any meaning whether or not we should be fighting anything to do with racism. I hope that every single one of us in this room and in the house where this bill now goes, Republican and Democrat alike would agree that racism has no place in the state of Georgia. But that bill does the opposite. By banning anti-racism efforts, what message are we sending our kids? That is okay to take a soft stand against racism. Or worse, yet that efforts to address injustice should be stopped. That is not leadership. That is cowardice. Racism is bad yesterday. Racism is bad today. And racism will still be bad for every generation to come. We should be teaching our children to stand firm in fighting the nasty aroma of discrimination. Colleagues, diversity is not a weakness. It is our greatest strength. Our schools, studies actually show children learn better, better in diverse affirming environments. Our economy, our businesses, and our communities are stronger because of it. And yet, House Bill 127 treats diversity as something to be feared rather than celebrated. That bill is not freedom, it is government overreach. The bill is politicians, not educators, dictating what is taught in our schools. Years from now, when people look back at this moment, they will not remember the pressure you faced from your far right base. They will not remember the political calculations you had to make to run for the next seat that you want to hold. They will only remember whether you stand for what is right or stand in the way. Colleagues, I would urge our colleagues across the hall to do all that they can to stop that bill. That bill sends a horrible message to Georgians and to this country as to the direction we want our world to go. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. Greg and I are sitting from the third. Excuse me, from the third. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, on your desk today, I would like to point out that you have an invitation to attend the first annual Guilded and Wild Annual Getaway and Gallup on Jekyll Island. It is being promoted by the Jekyll Island Foundation. The dates are May 2 through 4. It will be on Jekyll. There will be several social gatherings. There will be curated island excursions and a black tag dayla. Again, it is being put on by the Jekyll Island Foundation, our own sitenter from the 42nds. Wife Lindsay is a member of that foundation board and was doing a great job. You may or may not know, but Jekyll holds a very special place for me. I grew up going to Jekyll in the late 50s, 60s, and the rest of my life. I was honored to be to serve on the Jekyll Island Authority from about 2004 through 2019 and was there during the redevelopment of Jekyll. Again, it was a labor of love for me. If you have not been to Jekyll Island in the last 15 years, you need to go. Jekyll does not look like it used to. It is an absolutely beautiful place. This Guilded and Wild Gallup is called Guilded and Wild. The Wild comes from the early Jekyll Island club owners who were industrial barons of the United States in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. The Wild comes from the fact that the Jekyll Island is about a third developed. It is two-thirds undeveloped and it will always be two-thirds undeveloped. Jekyll Island, other than some capital money, does not receive operating funds at all from the state of Georgia. It relies on its own income stream and it relies on the Jekyll Island Foundation. I believe that this will be this Guilded and Wild getaway will be very successful and will become a wildly popular if any of you are familiar with the DNR and their weekend for Wild Life down at Sea Island. If you have attended that, you will really enjoy Guilded and Wild. I recommend it to you. There is a QR code on the back. You can scan that or you can get in touch with Mark Williams, former DNR executive and former House member who is now the executive director of the Jekyll Island Authority to get tickets. If you see Lindsay, I am sure you can get tickets to Lindsay also. Thank you very much for your consideration and I yield the Wild. Thank you, Senator. I recognize the center for the second. Thank you this morning, Mr. President and colleagues. This morning I do rise on a more somber note. This past week we had two of my constituents, the past away. One is Lieutenant Marcus Grays from the Chatham County Police Department who retired from the Savannah Police Department and went to serve in our County Police Department after an illness. The other one is someone who was absolutely like a father to me. Mr. Charles of Gordon, also known as Flash, he is a star athlete player. He is a huge, huge individual. He helped to find the 100 Black men of Savannah, good family and glad to be a part of their family. So my thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Janelle, and to my cousin's Craig and Gary and the loss of their father this morning. And so I would just ask Mr. President for a moment of silence for Lieutenant Marcus Grays. I'm Mr. Charles of Gordon. The Senator is asked for a moment of silence. Let's please stand and honor the Senator's request. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator. I see we have a former colleague on the floor, my good friend, the man from Savannah, the other man from Savannah, Georgia. The Senator, let's give Senator Jackson a big round of applause. Senator, how many years did you serve in this chamber? 14. And then you were in the house before that, right? 10 years in the house and 14 in this? I don't know how you look as good as you do then. I'm just going to spend them a son. Glad to have you, Senator. We're going to have the Senator from the 54th. Thank you, Mr. President. My friends, I wasn't planning to come to the well today to point the press privilege, but just on the drive down this morning from Dalton, I just was thinking about two years ago at this time. And two years ago, two days before the end of the session, I got work from my brother that my mother had fallen under driveway and broke her left femur. And on this day, she was having surgery to replace the end of that femur. And so I ran straight from this session into the hospital, where I stayed with my mother two weeks. And in the last weeks of her life, I was taking her back and forth to the grocery store once she needed to go. And one day, I was loading the groceries into the back of her car and turned around to get the buggy app and go put it in the buggy corral and out. My mother was halfway across the parking lot going back into the store. And I just looked and I said, Mom, where are you going? And she just looked over her shoulder without missing a stride and walking to my mother walk with a walker. But she could manage a buggy because only she was holding onto it. She just looked over her shoulder and she goes, somebody else might need this. My idiot on your own mother who walks with a walker was carrying the buggy back in the store because somebody else might need this. And I asked, that's when it hit me. You know, I've always given my father my greatest civics teacher and history teacher. He had for so many reasons. He's in the womb and the Georgia State Senate today. But I've always given all that civics and history lessons. The reasons why I jumped out of airplanes is a pair of trooper and the army. I gave all those civics and history lessons to why I would wipe the spit from my face when a 16 year old just spit in my face as a probation officer without allowing myself to be angered because I was the only thing between that kid and the cliff. And then I was sitting to hit me at that moment. You know, it was my father's with him and I was there. He gave me that propelled me, but it was my mother's heart. It was her heart that I chased off the door and airplane 46 times. It was her heart that I'd been wiped the spit from my face when a 16 year old was lashing out the world. So I just wanted to come to the well and say, Mom, I love you. I miss you and I haven't forgotten. Thank you, Miss President, you'll be well. You appreciate that message today and I'm sorry for your loss. I know it still hurts even even as time goes by, but I know from the story you told me she was a very, very special lady. So thank you for sharing that with us today. Senator from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. The people in Northwest Georgia are celebrating an extremely important birthday today. Everett Plant is turning 100. He is a World War II veteran. He served under George Patton. He even received two bronze stars. So please wish Everett Plant a big, all happy 100th birthday. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to take this occasion to introduce the new top cop from Macon County, Georgia, a formal corrections officer for twos. You promised to put a new face and new hope on the law enforcement to be in the top cop for Macon County in that area. And I've got great hope and great here. Great promise with great hope for you and we pray for you. Raise your hand. Let's welcome him. The new Sheriff Carlos Felton of Macon County, Georgia. Thank you, Mr. President, you'll well. All right. Good to have you here, Sheriff. Thank you, Senator. We're going to have you center from the 55th. Mr. President, colleagues, I too rise today to note the death of Dr. Martin Luther King. And I am still reeling over passing the DEI bill in the middle of the night, one o'clock in the morning. It is still deeply disturbing to me. It is deeply disturbing to the people that I represent. It is deeply disturbing to the foundation of this great country. Why? Because we continue to fight over this notion of diversity in America. This notion of diversity, equity and inclusion. This notion will we have one nation under God, indivisible, or whether it will be divided, whether we will be inseparable, or whether we will be segregated. Diversity, according to Oxford, is the state of being diverse, variety. The practice of equality of including or involving people from the range of different social and economic backgrounds. Equity to value diversity means to recognize, appreciate and respect the differences between individuals groups, personal environment where everyone feels safe, included and respected for their unique contribution. Equity, of course, is fairness and justice. Whereas equality means providing the same to all, equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge that make adjustments for the imbalance. In fact, giving two elephants is not the same as giving two rabbits. It might be the same equally, but it is not equity. It was not until 1961 that UGA was desegregated. It was 1895 that we had that Atlanta compromise where we accepted separate but unequal. It was supposed to be separate and equal, but it was inherently unequal. And I now come today to say that we must not allow democracy to die in the darkness. When we were not allowed to bring amendments to this floor, it was reminiscent of days that we've come full circle. 1954 fighting over education where little black boys and little black girls could not go to school with white girls and little black boys. Our nation will be judged by the content of our character and right now our character is being severely tested. Will we rise to the occasion? Will we exclude in 2023 that was 65 percent white, 7.5 percent black Americans in the University of Georgia? In 1995 it was 11 percent, almost 12 percent. The population of Georgia is 26 percent at that time, almost 32 to 35 percent now. But the rate of educated African Americans in the University of Georgia is now only 7.5. And decreasing. It has started decreasing ever since you got rid of affirmative action. And now you have come with a bill where you cannot even say anti-racism. You cannot even say the words are risk-losing of scholarship. You cannot say the words with respect to post-secondary institutions in an effort to promote as official position of the secondary, post-secondary institution a particular widely contested opinion. An opinion referencing unconscious or implicit bias, cultural appropriation, all our ship gender ideology or theory, microaggression, group marginalization, anti-racism, systemic oppression, social justice, social justice, and social justice. The word social justice is so commonly used, intersectionality, neo-pronials, heteronormality, disparity in fact, which is in all of the constitutional law, racial privilege, sexual privilege, or any similar or related formulations of these concepts is now threatening the scholarships and money. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do better. We can do better. We must do better. To save this great democracy. Rome was not torn from outside. It was torn from within. And we are threatening the Barry Foundation. When we limit the First Amendment right to just have a different opinion to silence people in this role, I can see where you will engross every bill of controversy. Where you will not allow anyone, you will have a meeting before the meeting, come in here and bring the law you want to pass and rob a stamp it. That's not democracy. Democracy dies in darkness when you cannot at least give another opinion. I love you. God bless you. I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. And I remind all the other senators. I didn't want to cut that senator off, but I do want to remind you it's three minutes. So please try to keep it as close to three minutes as possible. But anyways, I didn't want to cut you off, Senator. I'm bringing out a senator from the fifth. Thank you, Mr. President. Dear friends and colleagues, I'm here actually to ask my colleagues from the other side of this house side. To mention something that you may not may or may not know. My district isn't going to add the fifth senator district is one of the most diverse state senator district in Georgia, one in the country. I have people for more than 100 different countries, speak more than 100 different languages. We have 472 high school in Georgia. I'm proud of all of them. Some of the school has top football team, top tennis team or athletics, whatever you name it. But we have one school in my district is a number one not only state of Georgia, number nine in the nation out of 18,000 school, 18,000 school. If you walk up there, you can see what America looks like. What we're going to look like down the road, maybe one or two decades. It's so diverse. Do you think they look there?\n\nBecause they got admitted over there for DEI not necessarily Not necessarily you go over there going to see They see the beautiful children all faces. I mean I mean it's unbelievable to look at it It's they're not white. They're not black. They're not brown. They are not Indian or Japanese or Chinese You can find the student from all works of lives And they don't need it. They didn't get their got admitted because they are DEI They're the best and the brightest of this not only the state, but they are the brightest in this United States and As you know, I brought one of them a few weeks ago One one of the you know young scientists challenges So I'm really proud to represent And my district didn't needed 127 We are better off. We are better than that. So I hope my colleagues from the other side Stop this nonsense. We don't need it Without it will be much better off I just again didn't get elected. I'm not a DEI senator. I do the job. I did the job People elected me to represent them My folks don't need it and I don't think your folks need it either And I assure you if Donald Trump wasn't president you're in the voting for this You would involve I know you better than that. I know you all friends. I Know you didn't vote it from your heart So please please. I love you all. I love you all I want you to know I love you all and I'm blessed to serve you the all and I also blessed to serve my Constituency which is the future of America we need to move forward not backward Thank you mr. President I yield the well. Appreciate for listening I'm bringing out a certain from the 10 You Thank you mr. President members of this body. I was so only tried and getting everything I want to say in the next three minutes But it I didn't have the opportunity This past Wednesday to bring up the amendment that I had for The bill that was hijacked in this body But I had a very simple amendment that I'm sure everyone in here would have supported That simple amendment says if you're gonna ban DEI then you should ban DEI W Let me explain to you what that means When you talk about diversity equity inclusion we got to have a conversation in these United States about wealth as well We got to understand the importance of wealth in the road that he plays in In our colleges and universities and even getting those admitted that aren't even qualified itself that They come from wealthy families and they have the income to get in these great institutions When we talk about wealth let me just tell you something about the disparities in this country the top 10% And this country whole well over 67% of the country's wealth The bottom 50% whole less than two and a half percent of the wealth in this country The top 10% had a wealth on average of about six and a half million dollars The bottom 50% of our wage earners in this country had an average wealth a little bit less than 51 thousand dollars And 2022 the most recent numbers that I could get the median wealth for whites with six times that of people of color and I do mean blacks and Latinos as well You see we can't have a conversation about diversity equity and inclusion without having a conversation about wealth in this country I'm reminded of one of my favorite biblical verses this goes back to first Timothy in the sixth chapter and the 10th verse and it says for the love of money is The root of all evil For the love of money is the root of all evil so when we're talking about Policies that's been put together to eliminate diversity You got to include the conversation about wealth And to me wealth defines That mobility that upward mobility that people of color certainly Would have an opportunity to attain You know there are times in the last minute I have I just want to talk about my own personal experience by the way And I can tell you that I was raised in a very very poor family that really didn't have much of anything other than The relationships we had in the community When I went to college I had to work I had to earn scholarships and I had no one who funded my education But I can tell you the classmates that I set aside within the Ivy League towers that I went to Sometimes I felt inferior Sometimes I felt like I didn't have what it takes because they had so much more of an advantage than what I had But the one thing that I did have was an attitude where I went out and I worked much harder than anyone else I Had that in test of 42 that people of color Have to have if they're gonna succeed in a world that truly should be colorblind So I said in my colleagues today when we have this discussion about DEI We got to talk about the corrupted influence of wealth in this country. Thank you. I year-to-will Recognize Center from the 17 Thank you very much, Mr. President Senators when I came first came to the Georgia State Senate One senator who was chairman of committee talked to me harshly one day I called it verbal abuse and I say at the end that no senator Black all white would talk to me in that manner I wrote my memoirs that night and I called it racism in the Georgia State Senate and This past Wednesday night When I left here my hair was about to split and I wrote Racism in the Georgia State Senate part two Many of you are pretty good people I Came to know most of you you have pretty good heart, but some of you are just racist and you need to stop it I grew up in the South I grew up in Clayton County one of the most racist counties then in D.J. United States of America The clan just stopped marching down Main Street Jones, bro some 30 or 40 years ago I Was sitting in meetings Talking to people generally all white groups asking about inclusion. Can we have inclusion of everybody? And then they turned to me and said I Have black friends they come to my house. We're not talking about that. We're talking about real inclusion So I implore you today To stop this foolishness and have real inclusion I know you want to do what they do in Washington and let that trickle down I had a women's history Program this past weekend and a lot of those people who are my constituents Called me Tuesday morning. They got an email from the CDC saying they no longer would be employed So I know that you think that all this is great, but these people who made six figures years ago Found themselves unemployed back when we had COVID Couldn't pay the house notes Couldn't pay the car nose had children in college and What happened to them they were in the food pantry line Just like everybody else when they had been able to give to the food pantry So I employ you today To do what's right Those of you who are racist know who you are I Hope that's some help for you. I pray for you But I ask you today to do the right thing doing to do unto others you have them do to you Thank you, mr. President. I yield the way up Bring it on from 15 You Thank you, sir Appreciate it members of the Senate I would like to focus on a part that Envives a Spective our country that's doing great And that's our military The implementation of diversity equated inclusion in the military has yielded several positive results Improved readiness diverse teams bring unique perspectives that enhance problem-solving and Adaptability which are crucial for military effectiveness in complex dynamic environments Increased cohesiveness and Morales when I was in the Marine Corps we were in in a counter situation you could imagine following boot camp It didn't matter you matter your color. It didn't matter where you were from some of my best friends Sergeant stiltner My good friend Terry Houghton who served from Canada We call him Canadian We were all together we have won a court We were the same uniform. We were for the same cause although we came from we originated from different areas Enhanced recruitment one of the biggest things we have now with our military is a downturn in our recruitment That is something that we need to cure because we need a ready force in America by promoting an Inclusive environment the military can attract a wider pool of talent and retain service members from diverse backgrounds and soon ensuring a Rev-robus force. Excuse me better leadership development programs can identify and nature diverse leadership talent ensuring that leaders reflect the diversity of the forces they lead cultural competence Military personnel trained in DEI are better equipped to engage with diverse populations Which is especially important in international operation and peace keeping missions Please keep in mind a strong commitment to DEI enhances the military Reputation as an organization that values all individuals which can improve public trust and support Overall DEI initiatives in the military lead to a more effective capable and respected force that is better prepared to meet the challenge of modern warfare as well as peacekeeping Thank you, miss president yield well I Recognize senator from 27 Good morning ladies and gentlemen good morning ladies and gentlemen And you want to offend by that statement? Anyone think I shouldn't be able to say good morning ladies and gentlemen DEI purveyors do and I'll tell you a story In my school district and for sifth County They implemented a DEI program four or five years ago. They hired a company Called Gleesey Gleesey implemented a DEI program in for sifth County By which they trained our teachers and administrators My father-in-law is a bus driver for our school children in Forsyth County and one of the Chapters that they were told they had to read was called their pronouns are And very shortly after the implementation of the DEI program in Forsyth County My father-in-law received an email along with every single bus driver When they said please do not refer to the children as boys and girls That's exclusionary language Please use more inclusive pronouns in your communication with the young children So when we stand up here we Republicans have voted to remove DEI from our school system Those are the kinds of things we are seeking to remove There's a secondary that touches for sifth County as it relates to this program I'd like to tell you about We have the fastest growing Asian American population in Forsyth County not only in Georgia but in America Forsyth County is now a majority majority minority school system And for those students who graduate and go off to college those Asian students in particular They are added distinct disadvantage for admission under DEI policies One study found that for Asian students who applied a Harvard With a certain test score if they have a 25% chance of being accepted as an Asian They have a 35% chance with those same test scores as being admitted they were Caucasian A 75% greater chance with those same test scores if they were Hispanic and a 95% chance if they were African-American So we believe that what DEI actually does Is cause us to be hyper focused on Things that divide us We look at Ibron kendi a thought leader in the anti-racist movement Who says that you cannot separate capitalism for racism So we believe that the DEI core from some of the most radical elements Maybe not the elements that you all think of when you think of it But from the thought leaders like kendi it is by their own admission anti-capitalist And we believe it's anti-American Thank you Mr. President. I yield the well We're going to send it from the 44th Center from the 44 Center from the 44 Thank you Thank you Mr. President good morning colleagues happy sunny day A few minutes ago I spoke with concerned Current and former centers for disease control and prevention employees who have come to the capital To sound the alarm on the destruction of their agency The underlying foundation of the health care system that each of us depends on every day to prevent illness Manage chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes And bring breakthrough life-saving treatments is being butchered and dismantled In February President Trump ordered the indiscriminate firing of nearly 1300 CDC employees gutting 10 percent Of the agency's workforce This week another 24 hundred jobs At least were slashed Some say it's a riff or reduction in force But in many aspects of the agency It is can be more accurately called An EOF and elimination of the force These numbers represent years of investment In study and training for programs that protect every single one of us from disease outbreaks and public health threats Programs that track and prevent asthma smoking gun violence climate change And other health threats The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is almost completely gone One example is tuberculosis which is on the rise worldwide it has not been In the United States so far, but that is because of the CDC but with One quarter of the workforce at the National Center for HIV viral hepatitis STDs and TB prevention prevention slashed We will soon see those disease rates increase just the way measles have This year With misinformation spreading about public health from the top Let's note that chronic disease prevention funding is almost all federal That includes maternal mortality And excessive alcohol use prevention among other programs Over half of DPH's budget is federal funding Severe cuts have been and will be made Here due to this slashing Our Georgia Public Health Lab has already lost over half of its staff due to these federal funds 23 attorneys general have filed a lawsuit To try to block this decimation But with too many in the Republican Party captive to Trump and co-president musk and their destructive agenda It's not surprising that Georgia has not joined the lawsuit Despite the illegality of these actions and the harm to our citizens here in Georgia The CDC is a federal agency One of a very tiny number that is based outside of Washington DC And we've always been proud to have it based here in our capital city former staff And concerned citizens have marched and protested outside of the CDC headquarters Many times already in the last several months today Many of them came to the capital To sound the alarm and I urge all of my colleagues to listen to what they are saying And to the warning signs The truth is that when it comes to health every single one of us is connected And Having the CDC has always been a point of pride for Georgia I've been very proud to represent it and many of its employees here in the state senate But today I and all of us should be grieving the loss The decimation of this jewel of our nation and state that has led the world In disease prevention and saving lives I'm very alarmed as every American should be About what's to come When the next epidemic pandemic or disaster Comes home to roost You can bet That we will be far more ill prepared And when the time comes to try to rebuild what's been destroyed Who will fit the bill I doubt any of the billionaires currently running our government And putting in special favors for themselves Will be asked to fit the bill to rebuild the public health agencies that serve all of us instead It's also probably another safe bet That regular Georgians and every working American will be the ones footing that bill Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the law. Thank you, Senator I recognize the Senate from the 36 Senator reminds you as I've reminded everybody who hadn't listened yet It is three minutes, but I guess it didn't really matter at this point time, so You Thank you, Mr. President colleagues Here on the final day of our 40-day session uh, I rise to continue this conversation around diversity equity and inclusion You know when the nation watched A white policeman Hold down a black man And literally kill him With the TV cameras running kill him with the iPhones running cap when that was captured And spread across this country People in huge numbers Were shocked and appalled And it hit a whole new level of consciousness among a lot of people that had their eyes closed that were blind to the Suffering of people of color African-Americans in particular it pierced through and it touched the hearts of Americans To see that what they had thought was a myth About police brutality against people of color was actually playing out in real time and they were watching They were witness to a murder Of a person of color an African-American Before their very eyes and what did that do? It sparked a new level of awareness And a a a commitment a broad commitment in society That we must do better we must repair the harms that have been done We must take our nation to a new place we must continue the battle To build a more perfect union to perfect our democracy That's where the the the the DEI movement Got an infusion of hope This this this this lamentable build that has been crafted and Introduced around the country and and the motion of taking apart diversity equity and inclusion Approach in our education system uh Went through to sit the Senate committees in different under different bill numbers And in neither one did we have a single person from the university system testify Neither one with there was there was not one witness who came forward to testify other than the author of the of the bill To say why this was needed not one not in not in the higher education committee and not in the uh um The the the the the the last committee that from which it emerged uh chaired by the gentleman from the 21st so It was serious harm was done you're hearing from the voices of your colleagues today The the dismay and the outrage Uh, shutting down that that debate and put and and passing that bill and and it will be a stain on Georgia It will be a stain on Georgia My time is up and I will yield the well.

All those who approved vote, yay, all disapproved, vote, nay, Secretary-General Locke and the Senate will be in turn 24, 12th, perversey rise. Mr. President, I like this. Excuse the Senator from the 25th doing business outside the Capitol. All right, but the next vote, he'll be excused. The motion to agree, the yeas are 49, the days are 1, and this motion has prevailed. We're going to ask Senator from the 45th. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute to SB 63. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 63, by Senator Nixon, the 45th and others, Bill Tumintana, 9th to men, Part 15, Article 6, Judge Hyper 2, Title 20, those who agree to miss the landing provisions under the quality basic education act, so as to acquire that local school system, so as to offer certain exams to home study students, to write for notes requirements, to prohibit additional qualifications, to provide for definition to write for later matters, to be able to look at the laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 63, Bill Tumintana, 9th to men, Part 15, of Article 6, Judge Hyper 2, Title 20, those who agree to miss the landing provisions under the quality basic education act, so as to acquire the local school system, so as to offer certain exams to home study students, to write for notes requirements, or prohibit additional qualifications, to provide for definition, to write for later matters, to be able to look at the laws and for other purposes, Mr. President, that completes the order. Thank you, Mr. President. Senate colleagues, as you remember, Senate Bill 63 had to do with our home school students, allowing them to take their advance placement test in the residency school. The House added one test having to do with the Armed Services Vocational Test, and that's the only change to the bill. I'll be happy to answer any questions, Mr. President, or I'll yield the well. Thank you, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Senator from the 45th has moved that the Senate agree to the House substitute on SB 63, all those in favour of vote ye, all opposed, nay, Secretary Lamont machine. Thank you. Thank you. All in the motion, the yeas are 51, the nays are zero, and this motion has prevailed. We're going to send it from the 42nd. Mr. President, I move that the Senate agree to the House amendment to the Senate substitute to House Bill 136. Secretary, read the caption. House Bill 136, by Representative Newton, the 127th and others, billed to be 10 and 9 to amend, chapter 7, title 48 of those CGA, by income taxes, so to expand the texture of our contributions to foster children, child support organizations, while such organizations to include its qualified expenditures, reprun and mentorship services for justice and well-due to expand the reprun services that are qualified expenditures to write for tax credits to be used by certain insurance companies against insurance premium tax liability and further purposes. Mr. President, the Senate offers the following substitute to House Bill 136, billed to be 10 and 9 to amend, chapter 7, title 48 of those CGA, by income taxes and further purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the following amendment to amend, the Senate substitute to House Bill 136, by replacing 10 with 20 aligns 333, 351 and 373, by replacing striking 80 and 3090 with 80 online 368, Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to now send it from the 42nd. Thank you, Mr. President. House Bill 136 was the bill we passed last week that expanded our foster care tax credit. It also, we included our Affordable Child Care Study Committee work we did with the tax credits for child care as well, and this bill is a great bill. When the bill was on our side, there was a change to the existing law when it comes to the percentage of the funds that must be used on qualified expenses for our foster care support organizations, and what the House said is that it changed it back to the existing law to make the 90% go back to 80%. That just leaves the law where it currently is, so it doesn't impact the work these child support organizations are currently doing in our state. That's the only change that we have with the amendment. Have you taken any questions? You do have one question, Senator. We're going to have a sooner from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Yules. Yes, sir. So the change means that less money has to actually go to kids? No, that's not true. The change goes back to the existing law senator, and we know these organizations are doing great work in our communities now. We don't want to risk as we expand these tax credits. We want to risk the work that's being done right now, and so this puts it where the current law is. Will the center further you? Yes. So under the Senate's plan, how much of that 30 million would have to go to actual direct care? It's what the current law is, so it goes back to the 80%. How much will that be? I mean, 30%? Yeah, it's about 20%. Well, Senator Yules, for a further question? Sure. So if it's 24 million under the Senate's version, how much has to go to, no, sorry, under the House's version, how much would have had to go to direct care under the Senate's version? Well, the problem is the Senate version may not work because you may actually get it with these organizations can't operate. That's the risk we have, and so you can't look at it from a mass standpoint that way. If you think that we had changed the law on that, maybe best to have a separate bill that addresses that move forward versus using the bill we have now, we're expanding our credit to potentially handcuff these organizations. Will the center further you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that this is a bill? This is a what? That would directly affect that. The matter you told me to address on a separate bill? I couldn't hear you said. Is it not true that the Senate's version would have $27 million going to direct care and the House's version would have $24 million going to direct foster care? Not necessarily because we don't know if these organizations can operate if you change this overhead number. But I do know the budget chair, and perhaps maybe we'll put more money regardless into this. Maybe we can find a way to do that. Will the center further you? Sure. Would you be willing to let that come off of railroad side carts? What about railroad lines? Yes. Is that what we should take it? Maybe so. I think we should look at all of the projects in our state and look at different railroad lines. Potentially we could find some money somewhere and save some money and give it to these organizations. That's probably a good idea. Thank you. Thank you. You know, y'all sit right beside each other. I was just president. It is early. But I was saying the same thing. If you got questions, just come see me. Especially sit next to me. And the senator, well, I can't even understand you from over there, Senator. We got to turn your mic up over there. So now you have no more questions, Senator. All right. I ask that at least most of y'all stick with me on this. Thank you. No, senators. Thank you very much for all your hard work on this issue. Is any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. So the senator's moved that the senate agree to the House amendment to Senate substitute on House Bill 136. All those in favor of vote. Yeah, y'all opposed nay. Secretary-unlocked machine. All right. We're going to send it from 53 for what purpose do you rise? Thank you, Mr. President. Point of order. I don't have Senate Bill 151's substitute in my book. I don't know if any other senator has it in their book. I'll send some my back there to find it for you, senator. Thank you. I'm going to send some my back there to the House. On the motion to agree on House Bill 136, the A's are 54 and the A's are zero. And this motion has successfully prevailed. I do want to take a moment to thank the senator from the 42nd. He worked very hard on this child care tax credit. It was a priority of ours. And we appreciate he and the appropriations chair for the good work that they did on that. But this will be a child tax credit for every family in Georgia to take advantage of if they so choose. Thank you all very much. I'll give the senator a round of applause for that. Recognize the senator from the 32nd. For motion. I'm going to send the senator to the House substitute to Senate Bill 20. Secretary Reedicap. Senate Bill 20 by senator Kirkpatrick. 30 second and others to be telling like to amend Article 7, Chaiber 3, Title 20. Those who GA, I just call on your belongs to grants. So I've to provide for student loan repayment for veterinarians who practice shelter medicine and veterinarians who practice in nonprofit pet sterilization clinics to create the state veterinary education board for shelter medicine and pet sterilization to provide requirements to provide for requirements for participants. And a loan repayment program for maximum total and annual repayment amounts for terms for repayment agreements for rules and regulations for related matters to be looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House Office following substitute to Senate Bill 20. Those who have an active men and an article seven, Chaiber 3, Title 20. Those who GA, I just call on your belongs to grants. So I've to provide for tuition grants to children and spouses of certain public employees killed apparently disabled, lying in a duty and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to send it from 30 seconds. Thank you, Mr. President. You probably remember Senate Bill 20, which adds a shelter veterinarian service cancelable loan program to the Department of Agriculture's existing veterinary education board. The House added another section which was previously House Bill 56 that had to do with children and spouses of people killed in the line of duty. And Mr. President, if it's okay with you, the center from the first was the original Senate sponsor of that bill and I'd love for him to educate us. Thank you, Senator. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? We're going to send it from the first. So from a transparency standpoint, not necessarily from an educational standpoint because we have heard this bill. Current law allows a charitable donation by taxpayers on your returns and current law also allows children of, let me make sure we're right. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, prison guards, EMTs, highway emergency response operator. And what this bill does, this allows children and spouses, public school teachers who are killed or employees who are killed or disabled in the line of duty to receive the same benefits. So the school teachers or the workers or coaches there in Appalachia would be eligible for this. And that's what it does. Mr. President, I'll be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions, Senator. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. So the question is on SB 20, the senator has moved that we agreed to the House substitute. All those in favor of yay, I'll pose nay, secretary and allow the machine. You have no questions. The motion to agree the A's are 50 and the A's are 2 and this motion has prevailed. I'll move the senator to the House substitute to SB 255. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 255 by Senator Kowalsk with the 46, the bill to be entitled 9 to a men. Chapter 1, title 28 of the district of Georgia, NTA relates to general provisions regarding the general assembly. So that's the codified process for the authorization of statutory investigation or powers, discern committees of the general assembly. Try for Oson, subpoena powers relates to such investigatory powers, survive for confidentiality of certain materials to be supposedly preserved. Any authority, immunity, privilege or power granted to or possessed by the general assembly or as members, survive for delayed marriage, survive for effective dates or build public laws and further purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 255, the bill to be entitled 9 to a men. Chapter 1, title 20 of those GA, vote to general provisions regarding the general assembly. So that's the codified process for the authorization of statutory investigation or powers to discern committees of the general assembly. Try for Oson, subpoena powers relates to such investigatory powers and further purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. We're going to have a senator from the 46. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, the Senate, the House made only one very tiny change to this bill. And I believe that was at lines 54. We had the number of a code section that was incorrect, just literally a scrivener's error. And that was changed. Nothing else changed the bill. So I would recommend that we agree with the House change. President Wilk, have to welcome any questions or happy to yield the will. You have no questions, senator. Thank you. Does any of the senator which speak for against the measure? Chair hearing 9. The senator has moved that the Senate agreed to House substitute on SB 255.

Secretary, read the caption. Mr. President there is any tomorrow that senator are not participating in the presidential oil The House and its infinite wisdom added some more limitations on it or really just some parameters to make sure that the state could afford the program and I think they actually made some good changes for once so Urger favorable consideration I yield well Senators yielded any other senator which speak for against the measure Chair here's nine So the senator has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate bill 85 all those in favor of Of the measure of the motion will vote.

We're also following substitute to house bill 6 to you want to build to me title 9 to men are called to chapter 14 and title 40 those to GA Boy just be detection devices us to rise provisions relative to the use of automated traffic enforcement safety devices and school zones and rather purposes Mr. President I complete to the order now recognize senator from the 29th Thank you, Mr. President Colleagues, I don't think I have to go too deep into the weeds for y'all to understand what this is about This is about school zone speed cameras There is not a body in this building that understands this issue better than the Georgia State Senate Some of you were here for the subcommittee meetings some of you heard about the subcommittee meetings and we have discussed it in the offices and in the hallways We had some committee we had two subcommittee meetings one starting at 7 a.m. Where we spent over two hours talking about this and another one that started at 6 a.m. Where we spent just Just a little longer than three hours Discussing these issues. There were two speed camera bills that came over from the house At the same time and We looked at both of them and we took hours and hours And hours of testimony from everyone involved H.B. 651 As Requirements and guardrails onto the current program\n\nIt requires multiple warning signs cameras and other technology To let the individual that lives in that community who possibly knows there's a school there or who should know there's a school there That there is a school there And what the speed is in that school zone and how fast they are traveling through that school zone There's also language in there that talks about any misuse Or abuse of these devices will be investigated by the Department of Public Safety Who currently investigates the use and misuse of radar used by law enforcement officers There Is information in the bill that deals with the rebuttable presumption for law enforcement use of speed detection devices There's administrative hearings and judicial appeals language involved in the bill And there's multiple layers of checks and balances in the bill And there is language in the bill that discusses the distribution of the civil monetary penalties My favorite part of the bill if anybody asks me and I will tell you this I have received since I've been up here During this session I have received approximately five phone calls and or text messages about schools on cameras five I've received many many more about many many other things that seem to be to my constituents and others less important than this issue The part that I love about this is because of those emails and phone calls Because of the reason those of us in this chamber choose not to serve in local politics Is this is a local issue? If Fulton County, Muscogee County or any other county in the state of Georgia wants these cameras in Their community around their schools Then that should be something that the elected city council members county commission members or others Work out with the citizens in their community Both sides of the aisle we're always talking about local local local Until something we don't like And the only part of this process that I did not like was when an individual would come up and They're motive for not liking these Devices was the fact that they had gotten a citation Elected and unelected witnesses Well, I'm here to confess That in the Robertson home there have been two of these citations My wife and I we drug out the whiteboard we got out the markers We figured out the process we did all this planning everything and we did something really unorthodox We paid the tickets Because apparently one of us went through a school zone too fast Which currently you have to be going over 10 miles an hour This is what this bill does HB 651 and with that Mr. President I'll yield for any questions You do have a couple questions recognize from the 53rd Thank you, Mr. President with a whip yield. I do yield. Okay help me understand who can put up these traffic cameras now and How does that change in your legislation? Who can put them up now is some schools can County governments City governments And depending on how the contracts written I've seen a couple of contracts that were signed by sheriffs as opposed by The CEO of the county or the CEO a mayor of the municipality What ours does it puts the contract for obligation back on the the city and the county to be able to do these municipalities or the primary I guess you would say the the primary negotiators within the contract So are we taking the school board out of the negotiation like does now they currently have to apply for isn't that correct? They can in the reason we're doing that is because the school does not own the right of way Where the equipment goes on because the equipment has to be permitted by the Georgia Department of Transportation as safe equipment Because we wouldn't want just any city or county to do a contract that would require the implantation Foreign devices only the side of the highways because I think the senator would agree with me Especially around schools with young drivers. We need to make sure that the sides of the roads are as safe as possible and The roads in front of schools are not the property of the school district either so their interest into the actual property and the investment into the equipment what was determined in the Multiple conversations where they were really not that much of an interest party other than the safety that comes with it Well, Senator further yield I do so when your legislation a sheriff's department or municipal They could put these cameras up without a solicitation from the school board, right? right most of most of these are done post traffic studies and I think we had three different companies that said they do not put the equipment up until There's a traffic study to show that there is an issue with the speeding and Go back to the point where currently it's my understanding that everybody that testified was that no Sitation is written until the person until the person hits 11 miles an hour over the posted speed in front of the school Thank you senator. Thank you You have no further questions Thank you, uh, Mr. President. I would ask everyone to Support HB6651 and let's send this back from when it came. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well Thank you senator. We have a late arriving amendment secretary read the amendment, please Mr. President senator parent of the 44th offer the following amendment number one to amend the Senate Committee on rules substitute to House Bill 631 by placing line 33 with the following law enforcement Republic Safety Initiative this subject in Shail law and starting authorized that I'm a Suppressant that complete to you order Recognize senator from the 44th You Good morning colleagues. I am offering a Amendment number one So our the current law Requires that the revenues from the speed cameras be used to find quote Local law enforcement or public safety initiatives But the Senate rule substitute that we're considering right now would limit local governments to using these revenues to fund local traffic safety initiatives There are a couple issues with that the term traffic safety initiatives is not defined in code and it is also more narrow than What exists in the current law The current law gives local governments who are already Utilizing these cameras and have ongoing programs The flexibility to decide what capital expenditures are best for the safety of their communities My municipalities would like to be able to continue to have the ability to use these funds for broader Law enforcement or Public safety purposes particularly capital expenses such as public safety radio transmitters E911 radio consoles license plate readers Outdoor security cameras like flock cameras if you're familiar with those Body cameras bulletproof vests and other capital investments that I think most of us in this chamber would agree are worthy public safety expenditures But adopting by adopting this amendment To hb651 we would keep that status quo in the current law that provides the flexibility for local governments to use the citation revenues for public safety purposes So I urge your favorable consideration in permitting these worthy Capital expenditures to still be made with the citation revenue and I'm happy to stand for any questions or If there are none ask your favorable consideration on amendment one and yield the law One question send right on the center from 37th no question all right Thank you colleagues. I urge your support and I yield the law There's any other center to which speak for or again. So we're gonna send it from 37th Listen gentlemen soon. I'd rather speak for the bill against the amendment an issue of caution on February 28th 2018 when this passed the state house I was the only member of the state house representatives to speak against the bill that authorize the speed cameras in schools on I rise today to speak for those who think that photo enforcement of speeding is a bad idea That if there's areas that speeding needs to be enforced. We need to have human officers doing that because speed cameras themselves I think or problematic I live in a community when I was overseas in Germany that had photo enforcement everywhere No every mile of road wasn't Enforced by speed cameras But if you think about the roads we have in our communities the the cameras that are at every stoplight we could conceivably For a relatively low cost have speed enforcement of every single mile of road in Georgia conceivably the technology to do that I think computers speed cameras Locking down and controlling folks is is overreached by government. It's wrong I think it's I think it's too far and I think the The the process that this bill got an activity within 2018 What short-short-circuit the process and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of Georgians who think these cameras that are removed all together I stand here without qualifications speak against the use of these cameras in schools There are oftentimes law enforcement there that are working as crossing guards and they're managing traffic It's school times if there's a need for that law enforcement can focus their resources there and deliver it without speed cameras I say that I support the bill because the bill controls this process it limits the what I when I think is It's been referred to by by those in the vernacular is kind of crack cocaine for governments There's so much money that can be generated through these things because every single time a person Goes 11 miles an hour of the speed up in the schools and ban their hit next person ban their hit without without context Without looking if there's real danger created by the persons exceeding the speed limit by 11 miles per hour. So I think Georgians who think federal enforcement of speeding is a bad idea need to have a voice And I just wanted to rise Mr. President to give that voice today. I support the bill I appreciate the center for 29th the efforts he's Engaged in to kind of rain this in puts some integrity in the process I do think the bill makes the process way better and I thank him for that. I'm going to support the bill today I would oppose the amendment. I think the amendment Let's the purposes for which these dollars are used be too broad I think limiting them as they were in the rules committee. Sep2 is appropriate limiting to only traffic enforcement interest. I think it's a good control of something that can get out of control and incentivize governments to do more and more and more of Focusing on collection of dollars and not really focusing on keeping kids safe. I think the school zone Context is something that was used as a sort of a way to kind of get in who's who here's opposed to safety in school zones no one We all want safety in school zones But many Georgians think enforcing speeding with cameras goes too far And I just rise today to speak on their behalf Thank the center for 29th urge you to support the bill oppose the amendment and let's find today that we can repeal Speed zone cameras all together in this state. Thank you, Mr. President All right centers yielded Senator would you like close the bay or your All right, I'm bringing out a serum from 29 You Truly appreciate my my brother senator from the 37th he and I tend to disagree a little bit on this I have no issue with the amendment what I tried to do was narrow it down making it Just for traffic safety since that was the ultimate goal. I respect the leader from the from the other caucus For her amendment. I think I think she it's a heartfelt amendment and I do support her amendment Um, and I do want to point out a couple of things to my friend crossing guards are not law enforcement officers um They are normally volunteers or paid civilians that go out there and do a very dangerous job And um with a decreasing number of law enforcement officers in the state of Georgia and throughout the country I would encourage everyone to get comfortable with technology and How it's going to affect policing as we march forward and with that I would ask for everyone to please support the amendment And support house bill 651. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well All right centers yielded questions on the adoption amendment one author by the center from the 44 is the objection Wow didn't expect that Did you all did you all hear me right where the senator from the 44 author this Okay There is objections to all those and And uh in favor of the amendment will vote yay all opposed nay secretary and locked the machine You You You You Only adoption amendment number one the yays are 40 in the nays are 15 and this amendment has been adopted Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute as amended is there a objection to the adoption committee substitute as amended Hearing none of the committee substitute as amended is adopted Is there objection to agree into the forwarded committee, which is favorable to the passage of the bill Chair here is none the four of the committee is agreed to is there an objection to the main question being ordered Chiers none the main questions ordered questions on the passage of the bill by substitute all those in favor in favor of the bill vote Yeah, opposed now Secretary won 911 machines you B on the pass of bill the yays are 51 and the nays are three and this bill haven't reached the requisite constituencies for majorities there for pass by substitute. We're going to send it from the 29. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to take House bill 225 off the table please. Secretary Reed Decaption. House votes to 25. We're absent of washroom and the one 44th on others. Bill 209 and act to amend Article 2, Chapter 14 and Title 40. Those G A to speed detection devices. Justice repeal all laws. We'll go to enforcement and for other purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. Is there objection? Now objection to Secretary Reed Decaption. The bill is passed by substitute. It's been submitted. Senator Bras, chair members, President Sen. and rules are long substitute to House bill 25. Bill's to be done. Article 2, Chapter 14 and Title 40. Those G A vote to speed detection devices. So I appeal all laws. We'll go to enforcement and speed violations and school zones and other purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. Right now, Senator from 29. Colleagues, as many as you all may know, we've been talking about schools on speed cameras this session. And then you'll know the rest of it. What HB225 does is very simple. It repeals all laws, writing to the enforcement of speeding violations and school zones through the use of certain devices. And prohibits certain contracts for the enforcement of speeding violations and school zones through the use of certain devices. What it does is it sets a sunset on the use of these types of devices here in the state of Georgia. And if you are looking at the legislation as amended. If you go to line 91, it says no contract shall be entered into or renewed by local governing body or law enforcement agency for the enforcement of speeding violations in a school zone through the use of an automated traffic enforcement safety device. Honor after July 1, 2027. This code section sells stand repealed on July 1, 2028. With that, Mr. President, I think with the conversation we recently had, I will yield the will. Seniors yielded. We're going to send it from the 30th. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today in support of this bill. I'm going to tell you why. I'm going to quote Chairman Allen Powell. We have not just us, but our citizens have lost faith in this system. The system is not as my good friend from the 20 nights always states. We should not be policing for a profit. We had a small city chief of police come in to one of those early morning meetings at the center from the 29th. The first month we had 600 violators and they were warning tickets because they got used to the system. That came down to approximately 120 tickets a day. I started thinking 120 tickets a day, 180 day school year, that's over 22,000 tickets. At the current price of $75, that's over $1.6 million for one location for one city. I shall know my former background was in law enforcement. I was a sergeant over a motorcycle division. When my shift worked, we had five motor officers. We went to different school zones. We enforced school zones. The cameras are a good system when they're used properly. I want to see more guardrails and I think my good friend Chairman Powell on the other side has some other guardrails in place that he'll look at the last bill we just passed to tighten it up a little bit more. We do have to protect our children in school zones. I would like to see some of the money go to maybe crossing guards to help our crossing guards make sure the kids get across the street. What I don't want to see is this being used for again policing for profit. We can bring this together but we have lost faith in a system. I'm hoping over the next three years on the sunset, we can bring faith by the help of our local governments doing what should be right and listening to their constituents and tighten it down a little bit further. If we can't and we pass this bill and this bill passes over in the house, and if my constituents ask me to come back in three years, we will take a very hard look at this and say, it's a time that we can't have faith in this system anymore or has it been a good faith effort and trying to make sure the people trust what's going on with these speed cameras. So I would ask that you support this bill. Again, I appreciate the author bringing this bill to this body and we'll ask for a favorable consideration on the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I say this bill, this issue is probably one of the most unique and challenging issues since my friend from the first brought up the daylight savings bill. A lot of people have strong opinions on both sides and ultimately I think what the speed cameras aim to do and what this bill to do away with speed cameras aim to do is supported strongly on both sides but the issue is people are driving too fast in front of schools. That's the issue. What was the solution? Put these cameras up. Did they work? Yeah, they did. People started slowing down. I think that, tragically, right before these were put up in Banks County, a little girl was killed in front of a school by somebody going too fast. And I think with anything, there are going to be bad actors. And unfortunately, there are bad actors that are abusing this. There are bad actors that are making too much money off of these cameras. But I will say I spoke with my sheriff in Banks County this morning about this. There has not been a fatality in front of that school since these went up. Accidents, car accidents around the county have increased by 8% but in front of that school they have decreased. I don't think it's hard to determine what's causing that. It's these cameras. Now, I'll be honest, I've gotten four of these tickets myself. I don't like them. Four. One of them was down in South Georgia and REN, Georgia, that I didn't even know it was there. So as someone who isn't a fan of these, you know, but I will say I'm against doing away with them completely because there are some good actors out there that are doing it the right way. I lean more towards regulating these to make sure that the bad actors are held accountable. In the previous bill we just passed out, you're going to find a city 2500, $5,000 for every single time. They don't enforce this properly. Well, that's how you hit back. That's how you hit their pocketbook back. So, you know, I'm going to vote no on this. I don't want to see these band. I do want to see them regulated. But while there are some bad actors, I do think that these cameras have saved some lives. And I'm happy to answer any questions that I can yield to well. You do have a couple questions. Oh, just one question. Actually, Senator from the 41st. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, do you? I do. Senator, are you aware that the recidivism rate for these tickets? If you a person is likely is not likely to get a third ticket, only 2% of people get a third ticket. I'm aware. Are you aware of that, Senator? I am. Senator, do you just like to drive fast everywhere? Is that what it is? Well, I'll tell you I didn't get them in the same location. They're different locations. Oh, I'm glad you're a fast learner then. Well done. All right. I'm going to yield the well. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Senator's yielded. I'll yield. All right. Any other senator we speak for against measure? Chair, I'm from Twin Nights. Would you like to close the debate? Friends, a few years ago, we added the word courage to the Georgia pledge in this chamber. We received two bills dealing with the same subject matter from across the hall. I think we understand how courageous we are over here. Let's see how brave they are over there. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. Questions on the adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Here, none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agree to the board committee, which is favor to the past of the bill? Chair, here's none of the board committee has agreed to. Is there objection to main question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the main question. Is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those of favor to the bill vote. Yeah, you pose a secretary and lock the machine.\n\nyou You On the passive of the bill. The the situation majority is there for pass bus up to you. Recognize the senator from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agreed to the conference committee report, the House Bill 68. Secretary Reed, the caption. Mr. President, the committee on the conference on House Bill 68 recommends that the House of Representatives and the Senate receive from their positions and that they attached committee of conference substitute to House Bill 68 be adopted, respectfully submitted, Senator Tilleryach, Chairman. Mr. President, I complete. We're going to ask the appropriations chairman to present the budget. Thank you, Mr. President. House Bill 68, the conference committee report. Many of you have studied it for a few days now so you know what's in it. I'm just going to hit the highlights of the differences and then ask for your favorable consideration. When we left this body, the Senate's position was that we should fully fund the promise scholarship, the conference committee report fully funds the promise scholarship at $141 million. Another position of the Senate is that we would not pay for today's projects with tomorrow's money that we wouldn't have a bond project. We would pay for that instead with cash and the record state reserves that we have. The conference committee report preserves that position and pays for all projects with current dollars. Further, we had to, you'll see that we did have to reduce some of the dollars that you may have seen in the Senate side. This is not a budget that has a lot of discretionary spending, the knickknacks and the trinkets are out of it. It's more focused on necessities, those necessities being in the forms of provider rate increases, for certain Medicaid items, those also being in corrections for the items that we've talked about there. There were a lot of issues in corrections that we began addressing early on in January. We had to call Tyrone all over the commissioner several times to discuss those things with him. And he was very helpful in working through where we would end up landing. The Senate's position concerning supportive independent pharmacist and the state health benefit plan is also preserved. In the judicial branch, there were a lot of different pay raises for judges and prosecuting attorneys. All of those will start in January, which is the same position that the Senate had earlier. They do start at a slightly lesser amount, closer to the amount the House wanted, which would put the maximum amount for a Supreme Court justice now at 230,000 and work a waterfall down from there for other positions. The conference committee report has several additions in agriculture, including those for an emergency management position and for meet and specter positions. In the Department of Community Affairs, we clarify that the reductions taken by the House and by the Senate will be carried forward in the conference committee report, but they will stay out of the state housing trust fund and also out of other programs that we had started in community affairs. I already mentioned to you about corrections and I talked to you about the provider rate increases. One position that the Senate did move on relates to student support services. The House plan to support mental health in schools. We moved closer to their plan. We did not fund and the conference committee report did not fund the database that we had talked about earlier, but we did move to their line items concerning student support services and mental health. We also moved closer to their position on a way to support poverty. It is not a QBE item and it's a one time pilot fund, but we did move closer to the House's position to try that in the areas moving forward. In the ERS budget, we stayed with the $26 million that's recognized in the base, but the Senate's addition of that item had to fall substantially to about $10 million. We still have language that explains that we want that to be a one time supplement paid to eligible retirees and we are letting it be paid upon approval of the board. In human services, the way this budget ended up balancing out is the governor saw two areas that he really wanted to support. One of those was a building at the University of North Georgia. The second was in the Department of Human Services out of home care. That's the monies that are paid to those who foster children across our state and those institutions that do so. There was a look like there's going to be a substantial shortfall on that budget and the governor brought a total of $50 million total for projects, the UNG project, and the out of home care project to make those be at a number that he has. The other positions that the Senate took relating to many of the capital projects remain the same. There was one late addition where the Senate funded or the Comprehendium Report funded a half position at Valdosta State University, but the rest of those I believe were already funded in the Senate's portion. The big highlights I think from our bigger positions is the promise scholarship is fully funded. There is no additional debt in this budget and it does balance thanks to the help of our friends in the house and our friends at the governor's office. Mr. President, I think I've cleared the highlights. If there's any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them. If there aren't, I'll yield the well and allow us to vote on House Bill 68, the state's 2026 general budget. I see your lights come on over there, Senator. Looks like you got a little mini me over there. Assuming from the 19. I yield. For those of you who can't see, he's smart too. He has my little three-year-old son, John. He is adorable and buddy. I love you a lot. I'm so proud of you all, Mr. President. Also is another mini me. That is 11-month-old William who is excited as he can be. And my beautiful wife, Ashlyn Nicole, we celebrated our ninth anniversary yesterday. All right. Congratulations. All right. That's outstanding. So now y'all ask me those mean questions. I just got a kid. Happy anniversary. Recognize Senator from the 38th. Thank you, Mr. President and Happy University. And anniversary, Mr. Chairman, do you? Yes, sir. Appreciate John for waving so I can ask you a couple questions if you don't mind. The last time that you presented the budget, there was money originally in the budget for mental health. Am I correct? That is now back in there for student support services at 19 million. I apologize. I could hear you a little bit, but I couldn't pick up everything you said. There is now money in the budget, $19 million for student mental health support services. Yes, sir. It was in the sentence version. We took and moved the APEX program over. In discussions with the House, they made a very convincing argument for moving that back to D.B.H.D. So we did that and then funded a priority of the House and student support services with mental health. Yes, sir. Wonderful. And so now also for the first time, we're going to have a opportunity weight of $15 million in the form of a grant. But that is to support students that are in economically disadvantaged schools. There is an economic weight. It is non-QB. So it's not a QB formula grant. You'll see the language is very clear. It's one time pilot. We're going to watch this. As you know, there's been a lot of discussion over the years. What we should do for the QB formula going forward. We did not want to tie our hands behind our back by entering into something now that school systems would balance their budget or base their budget on in future years. That could hinder that process. That's fair and final question. You mentioned calling Tyrone. Yes, sir. You know the famous singer who wrote a song named call Tyrone. It is so funny that you should say that as it turns out when you're working through the budget process hours and hours at night, it does get late. And on more than one occasion when we would call Tyrone, someone would bring that up and it did get played on more than one occasion. But you can't use my phone, Senator. There we go. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to send it from the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Yill. Yes, sir. It's a good friend from Columbus area. Senator, is it still our understanding that we will be taking hard earned taxpayer dollars and still supporting public broadcasting, even though it is a non-governmental agency? Well, it is a governmental agency. I do know that your position is that it may not serve a governmental purpose. But yes, sir, the Georgia Public Broadcasting and its emergency television and its education programming is funded at about $13 million in this budget. Senator Furley, yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, would you agree that their emergency response, abilities over the past 30 years have greatly diminished through the use of some of the budget. Through the use of cell phone towers and the fact that most Georgians carry one to two cell phones on them and we get all of our emergency notices through that cell phone. I do think that it's becoming more and more pervasive cell phone use. And Senator, do you further agree that every other broadcasting system in the Atlanta area and throughout the state of Georgia has an advertising department where they have to go out and generate their own funds through advertisement sales? Yes, sir. You're correct. Thank you, Senator. And to follow up on your point, as you know, that's why we took a 25% reduction to the GB Georgia Public Broadcasting budget about three years ago for that purpose. And I understand if you want to continue to address that as we move forward. I also will support your amendment that we talked about offline that would require Georgia Public Broadcasting and live being the main television show in our correction facilities. I think that educational programming has a lot of merit and you brought that up and I will support you if we can find the bill to do that. All right. Let's see this last question. Senator from the six. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, do you yield? I will yield to my best friend, the rules, chair. Senator, I was looking through the budget and I didn't see anything on DNA testing. Did you do anything with DNA testing in the budget this year? We actually did have money in the amended budget for DNA testing at the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. As you know, we started a cold case unit two years ago. It's been extremely successful at solving many of the cold case crimes. And there was $100,000 in the amended budget to expand that program. Senator, would you further yield? Yes, sir. That's not in this budget, though, just for clarity. Senator, you had mentioned your two minimies over there and I was just curious if any of that DNA money could be used to testing by from Senate press for your third minimie. Yes, sir. That's probably a wise idea. We need to call TideRone. There are no further questions, Mr. President. We'll yield the well. And thank you all again so much for your extremely diligent process involvement in this matter. I appreciate the calls. I appreciate how important that you made this document and how much you weighed into it. I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. I'm just a committee report to House Bill 68. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate that. I appreciate all the hard work you and the staff. Yeah, you'll give them a round of applause. Great. I appreciate all the hard work you and your office did on this, Senator. And we thank you. I appreciate your counterpart over there in the House. And there you all worked very hard on this. All right. Is any of the Senator wish speak for against measure? And so now we're in the, does any Senator. Questions on the adoption of the conference committee report on HB 68, all those in favor of adopting the conference committee report will vote ye. Opposed nay, Secretary, on the machine. You have a question. Senator, from 31st, what purpose do you rise? On the motion, the A's are 54 and the A's are one and this motion has prevailed. And the Senate has adopted the conference committee report on the House Bill 68. Senator from 31st, what purpose do you rise? Mr. President, make a motion. Are we signing it out? We are, we are finished with what we're obligated to do up here. So that's a, that is a very valid motion right there. Senator. I tell you what let's do. Let's hold that thought. Let's grab lunch. Thank you over. And then we'll take, we might just take it up there. Do you mind maybe just withdrawing the motion just for a second? We're going to have a soon from 31st. Mr. President, I hope this is not what the University of Georgia's football team is going to do later this year. But I will withdraw the motion. You tell me, oh, you're a tech fan. That's right. It's been so long since, since I forgot you all still had a team down there. It's been so long since I won that game. Stop going to it. Mr. President, just remember he made the motion. All right. So, so we're going to take lunch right now. And yeah, look on the list now because I'm, I'm ready, I'm ready to adjourn when y'all are. So, but we'll check with the house and see, see what they might have still available. And hey, I do want to recognize, before we go to lunch, I do want to recognize some of the spouses that are in the room. I see the former Senator from the 49th, which is now the obviously, Senator from the 49th. Beautiful wife right over here. And the Senator, Senator Strickland's wife, Lindsey is here as well as Senator Beaches, wife and Senator. Uh, let's say goodman. This carers over there as well. Let's give those ladies round the polls are putting over these guys. And there and you know, on sunny day, you usually have, you know, a lot of people, some people wear different looking outfits, some people wear searsucker, some people do, you know, other things with their clothing. I just want to recognize the Senator from the 13th, because I don't know what that is right there. Either, either his closet was dark this morning, or he's got more confidence in buying this room right here. All right, let's, let's, uh, let's, uh, let's break for lunch and we'll come back in about an hour. You",
