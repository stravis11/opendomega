  "transcript": "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I saw us with an amazing love and love, love fly with us you as the senior rabbi of congregation Benetara of Sandy Springs since 2004. He is a ninth generation rabbi. During his time in Georgia, he has grown the synagogue to become one of the largest Jewish congregations in the entire state. We have 900 families in membership. He has served many leadership roles in our community, including his president of the Atlanta Rebinnical Association, board member of the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, and Jewish Family and Career Services. Rabi Heller has served on the Sandy Springs City Ethics Commission and the Commission on Diversity. Rabi Heller is visible on the national scene as a member of the committee on Jewish law and standards, and a member of the advisory board of the Pozen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization. Before becoming a leader in our community, Rabi Heller graduated from Harvard University with honors and published research in the journal for Computational Neuroscience and served as director of distance learning for the Jewish Theological Seminary. During the period after 9-11, he served as the rabbi of the downtown synagogue, having started his job on September 9. It was one of the synagogue's closest to the site of the World Trade Center. Rabi Heller and his wife Wendy are the proud parents of three children. Welcome, Rabi Heller. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, honored representatives, thank you for allowing me to bring you blessings today. As we reflect on the awesome work that each of you has committed to carry out, let us take the words of Exodus chapter 18 for inspiration and guidance. It is the story of a man named Jethro, not the clampets denwitted cousin, but Moses's thoughtful father-in-law. He was the high priest of Midian, and he heard about all the troubles that the Israelites had encountered and how God saved them, liberating them from slavery in Egypt, bringing them through the waters of the sea, saving them from implacable foes who attacked, and bringing them on their way to the promised land. On my heart this morning is the journey, the wilderness through which my people wander at this very moment. That is a burden that I bring and carry with me, but my task today is to bring blessing to you. So let me share with you the words that Jethro brought to Moses. So Jethro saw Moses judging the people from early in the morning to very late at night every day. It was like signy die every day. And he sees Moses and he says, you can do better, and he suggested to Moses appoint yourself a legislature. Jethro says, seek out from amongst all the people, people of valor, God fearing people, people of truth, haters of ill-gotten gain. And Jethro is saying that only with people of that caliber, leaders of tens of fifties of hundreds of thousands, will this nation come to its rightful place, its promised land in peace. I'd like to suggest that the advice that Jethro gave is the very same advice and guidance that we ourselves need, that we need to see ourselves as being from among the people, knowing that we each represent an important segment of the community, that we have to be people of courage, being willing to act for truth even if it is against what is popular, that we must be people who are God fearing. It is not enough to have convictions, but those convictions can't be the convictions that lead to convictions. We have to have a moral compass. We have to be on se, I met, we have to be people of truth, with the wisdom and discernment, to understand the reality of a matter, even when others might seek to obscure it. We must be haters of ill-gotten gain, we must come with integrity and look for the good of all, not just for the good of ourselves. Now of course the greatest miracle of the Bible, I don't know if it's that a father-in-law has useful advice or that a son-in-law chooses to take it, but indeed it is a chapter later that Moses has taken this advice and with that legacy in place, the people of Israel, the children of Israel are able to receive the Ten Commandments, a legacy that we, that they would pass on to the world and are still in North Star for so many. With that verse, with that lesson in mind, let us pray. God of all, we ask your blessings for these men and women who have taken on the awesome responsibility of service to the people of the state of Georgia. Help them be, as Jethro said, from among the people remembering always whom they are here to serve. Help them be people of courage, not afraid to say what must be said even if it is not what brings accolades or approval. Help them to be God-fearing guided by faith and conscience. Help them to be people of truth with the discernment to reach the heart of every matter, even when facts are obscured by rhetoric so that they may enact laws and carry out policies that benefit all who live and work in our state. Help them to be haters of ill-gotten gain. Let them approach every issue with integrity without regard to their own well-being, without temptation. Let them have the strength of character to always put ethics before ego, purpose before personality, and public before party. Let our lawmakers indeed be worthy so that you may bless them. Bless our lawmakers with wisdom to ensure the safety and security, the health and wholeness of all who dwell here. Bless them with the vision to help our state preserve the beautiful gifts of nature that you have given us. Bless them with discernment to alleviate poverty and seek prosperity for all. Bless them with the insight to conduct their affairs with integrity. Bless them as they leave their home and work untended to offer service to the greater good. Watch over their families, their businesses, their homes, bless partners and children, co-workers and clients, and all who wait for their return. And may their sacrifices of time and treasure yield blessings for all. May they be illuminated, Lord, by your light, to be people of the nation, to be people of courage, to be the fears of God, to be people of truth, to be haters of the all-gotten gain, so that the people of Georgia, all of us, your children, to reach the place of your promises, the places of truest potential in peace, and let us all say amen. Now we recite the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and I remember in all the for which it stands, one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all. Also, thank you, Mike. Thank you so much. Thank you. Get one? Yes, sir. Thank you, Rabbi Heller, for those words and your lessons and your encouragement. Door, keep your May unlocked the doors, members, you may join Rabbi Heller in the south any room to meet him and have a photo that be your desire. Well, good morning again, members. Thank you, Rabbi.

So thank you again for joining us, and we thank you for your service. Thank you, Representative. Thank you for the veterans here. Thank you for those veterans in the gallery. Thank you for your service to our great country. Representative Nullowicz, saying, Chairman Knight, recognize for a morning order. Give the members in the well your attention, please. Chairman, lady, okay, Representative Nullowicz. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Today, as you may have noticed, coming into the capital is Georgia, Japan Day at the capital. This is the 50th anniversary in 2024 of official diplomatic relations between the state of Georgia and the nation of Japan. And we are very excited that there are multiple Japanese businesses here today that you can learn about, you can learn about the tremendous economic impact that Japanese owned companies have in the state of Georgia. And most importantly, I think we would like to recognize some friends who are in the gallery right now. We have Consul General of Japan, Miyomita, and several members of the Constellar staff. Thank you so much for joining us today. And it is especially notable that this evening, Consul General of Miyomita is going to be conferring upon former Governor Nathan Deal, the order of the rising sun, gold and silver star in recognition of his outstanding contribution to promoting regional exchanges and mutual understanding between Japan, the United States, and Japan. We look forward to seeing that this evening. Chairman, may I? As many of you know, we've been up here before with a special relationship that we have with Japan. Georgia has with Japan, but not only Georgia, but our country. They are a global partner and strategic ally. And it is so important that we continue these relationships and particularly to Georgia. 50 years, they are one of our largest trade partners. And if you look around your communities, you're going to find that there is a Japanese business there and they are employing Georgians, almost 50,000 Georgians. So it is a great, great partnership that we have all around with Japan. And we are excited about the 50th anniversary, and we're excited about the next 50 years. Consul General, thank you so much, and we look forward to the rest of the day. Thank you, members. What a great evening and what a great honor for Governor Dio and thank you, Consul General, for recognizing the Governor at that time later in the day. Thank you all for being here in the house today, and thank you for your relationship, your friendship. Chairman Dickey, in the Houston County delegation. Oh, yeah. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. They're on the way. They're on the way. We got a very distinguished house in County delegation. Oh, it's fine. We got a new, do we have a new member? You do? He loves you, every day, because he's a very new member. He's just kind of in it. I'm glad to have him. Anyway, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to recognize the distinguished group in the gallery that came this morning, Houston County Leadership Class. They're juniors, and we feel the stand. They're juniors from all the high schools across Houston County. And I really appreciate the great job April Bragg does leading our chamber and bringing this group along with the Chairman Heath Cart. This morning too. It was great to see both of y'all and what you do in Houston County. I hope these young people enjoy that day here, and great to see y'all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good looking group. Y'all have a great delegation. I wasn't talking about the delegation being good looking. I was talking about that group up there. Thank y'all for being here, juniors, and we wish you the best. It's the last meeting of the year and your senior year. So thanks for representing Houston County. We'll park, Florida Hong, recognize for a morning order. Give the members your attention, please. All of these are very important to a lot of people, not just the members making the presentation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today we are celebrating Korean American Day in Georgia. This year marks 121st anniversary of the first Korean immigrants who came to this country and pursued of the American Dream.\n\nWith more than 100,000 Korean Americans who call Georgia home, they've not only made critical contributions to our economy and society, they've helped strengthen the critical bilateral relationship between the state of Georgia and the Republic of Korea that's resulted in approximately $14.5 billion in investments here in the state of Georgia over the past few years. We have some special guests with us this morning. The console general from the Republic of Korea and leaders of key organizations that serve the Korean American community, including the Korean American Association of Greater Atlanta, the Peaceful Unification Advisory Council, the Korean Veterans Association, the Korean American Chamber of Commerce, the Korean American Coalition of Metro Atlanta, and many others. So to our special guests, if y'all would rise and be recognized, and members, if y'all will give them a warm welcome to the People's House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the welcome. Thank you, we're apart. Welcome to the People's House. We're glad you're here. And boy, what a great relationship we have with South Korea and everything y'all do for the partner with us here in the state of Georgia. We got to go on pretty good, don't we? It's good stuff. So thank y'all for being here and thank you for your support. And come back again. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caps into a group of privileged resolutions?

Is there any objection to adopting the privileged resolutions? Chair, here's none, and the resolutions are adopted. Members, we will move on to afternoon orders. First I want to make you aware of one of the key, if I can have your attention, one of the critical players in our success in keeping order and the work that we do here at the Scotty Long, one of the in the clerk's office, Scotty has some health issues right now, he's in the hospital, so I'll ask you to say a prayer for Scotty, and remember him next couple of days, and he'll be back with us very soon. So remember Scotty, a dear friend and a great member of the team that helps this house function. Good men. Okay, afternoon orders. I've not been doing a very good job in enforcing time limits, but I'm getting very close to that. So afternoon orders, you have three minutes, three minutes, and you need to be getting to the end of your comments very close to the end of your comments, or we're going to let someone else speak. So with that, that's an admonition you should follow. We'll begin our afternoon orders with Representative Daniel for our first afternoon order and a friend. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. You're welcome. He's awake this morning. We'll see if he'll cooperate. Good morning, y'all. Over the past few weeks, I've sat at my seat back there and listened very intently about maternal mortality from my colleagues. And I've listened to them speak at length about the impact that it's having on women across our state and how it's affecting their families. And on those points, I couldn't agree more. But what has been glaringly and alarmingly absent from every single speech that they've given on this issue, as is typical with many of the issues they raise, are tangible solutions to the problem. And that's because they have none. There is no substance, no concrete plan, no action. It's a complaint filled words. Standing up here and referring to women as birthing people does not save women's lives. And releasing statements tying our maternal mortality rate to a lack of Medicaid expansion when Medicaid has already been expanded for expected mothers and their children is not only disingenuous, but dangerous. Since the beginning of session, they have stood up here and told the people of Georgia that they are urging Republicans to act on this important issue. But the truth is we have. Republicans in the House, under the leadership of Speaker Rauston and Speaker Burns, have worked on solutions and delivered results on this issue going all the way back to 2014 when the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review was created. Since then, Republicans have proactively led on this issue to deliver real results. And I'd like to read you some of those efforts that have been made over the last five years. A study committee was led by Chairwoman Cooper in 2019. It paved the way for significant policy to address the issue. House Bill 1114 and 2020 and later Senate Bill 338 in 2022 extended postpartum Medicaid coverage from mothers up to a year after birth, providing critical, continual care for an additional year. Senate Bill 106, the Healthy Babies Act, passed last year and was signed into law by the Governor that creates a Medicaid program to provide remote maternal health clear services to women with high risk pregnancies and rural areas. House Bill 911, our fiscal year's budget, included 800,000 to increase, select OBGYN reimbursement levels, which will increase access to expecting mothers. And the other in House Bill 19, another budget, it provided $1.7 million to fund the pilot program within Senate Bill 106 to provide home visits and at risk and underserved rural communities and through early childhood. It included $47.9 million in ongoing funding to provide coverage through 12 months post delivery. And it eliminated the waiting period for children and pregnant women to receive Medicaid. And finally Senate Bill 35, which was agreed to yesterday by this body, it required glucose monitors to be covered as a benefit for Medicaid recipients to address diabetes, which is one of the leading complications of infant mortality. These are just a handful of solutions that Republicans in this body have delivered on to address maternal mortality in our state. And as someone who just recently survived a very complicated and high risk pregnancy, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Chairwoman Cooper for her continued efforts around maternal health because it is possible that I wouldn't be standing here today with you guys if it were not for the efforts that have been made over the last decade. Today I have a number of resolutions so bear with me. I'm going to try and talk fast. But the first is to recognize today as maternal health awareness day. And I have a group of women in the gallery if you guys want to stand. They will be sharing their stories later on. They're here with healthy mothers, healthy babies. And they're going to be sharing their stories in Liberty Plaza from 3 to 5 p.m. this afternoon. And so I would encourage all of my colleagues to stop by if you have the time. Second, I would like to recognize Miss Sharina Heinz Rush if you could stand up. This woman was solely responsible for keeping me in the hospital and recognizing the life-threatening issues that I was experiencing. And so I brought her today and I'd also like to shout out some of my doctors because I owe an immense amount of gratitude to them. Dr. Tameka C. Dr. Topay Fapahunda. My midwife Shannon Mayfield and my team of nurses Susan Katie Tammy Sharina, Aura and LaShika. Please help me recognize their efforts and contributions to maternal and infant care in Georgia. I'll end my statements today by saying I believe that it is vital that we are honest with the women of the state about the efforts that are being made to improve maternal and fetal outcomes so that women will feel comfortable seeking care when they need it most. While I cannot say whether or not my friends across the aisle will continue to stand up here and politicize this important issue, I can guarantee that we in this body will continue to lead and we will seek solutions because that is what the women of Georgia deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members will\u2026 Chairman Gilead, you ready? Fine gentleman from down on the coast in Savannah, Georgia. Give the representative your attention, please. If you'll stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members and brothers and sisters of this Georgia General Assembly, we stand today with the world, we stand today with the nation, we stand today with the state of Georgia, and we stand today with the city of Atlanta. A gentle giant has taken his rest. We're praying right now just minutes ago the King family had a press conference and we're praying in the home going of Mr. Dexter Scott King. Yesterday he took his rest and fighting a battle dealing with prostate cancer, but he took his rest from being that gentle giant, from fighting for the rights of intellectual property of the King legacy, from fighting for the rights as a general giant and following the wishes of his mother to make sure we had a Martin Luther King Center for non-violence and social change. We're praying today for Bernice, we're praying for Marty, we're praying for Leah, we also praying that Dr. Naomi King is in the hospital for the last month, one of the matriots of the family. We're praying for Isaac Ferris and we're praying for every other member of the King family. Today we stand with the gentle giant who they said emulating his father and looks and in conversation and in voice, but more so a great giant who was very quiet, who has taken his rest. And so to the members of this assembly, we stand here today and asking for your prayers that we will pray for the King family and we'll pray for the family of the late Dexter Scott King when we have a moment of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are appropriate. Thank you members for your attention and your respect. Thank you, Mr. Jasperous. Take just a second, let it win. Chairman Jasperous has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, if you'll look on your desk today and all the other things that are on there, you see our color, how to do a road naming resolution handout. I'm going to give you a couple of hints. We have a great policy analyst, Abby Day, that created this for you. We did this last year to try to simplify how this is done. Mr. Chairman, suspend just for a moment. Yes, sir. Members, I want you to pay attention to this because if you come ask me how to name a road, I'm not going to help you. Chairman's doing that right now. So for those who don't read very well, you best listen up. This is the audio version. No, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yeah, we do talk to a lot of people about this, but this is a great honor that you have at your hands to be able to name a road around about a bridge, intersection, section of a road, whatever you choose to, after someone in your community that needs to be honored. If you're not doing it, you're missing out. Because it's a great opportunity in your community to recognize these special individuals that have done something, special in your community. Now I do underline the words when I say choose carefully, especially if you're choosing someone who is still alive because things change, things happen. So be careful about that. You and you bring a bill to me that does this. I will warn you about that personally. Josh Waller, our G.repercentive is our key guy on this because you'll have to get what's called a conflict letter that says somebody already named it before you. Someone in your seat, House, when you know, 10 years ago, she could have named it. So we make sure that that's not done and then we go ahead and name these roads. So you've got a couple of weeks. It's not like a stress again and done yet, but it will become that because you've got to advertise it in your paper and all these little things like that have to be done. Do it. Don't be timid. I'll set right over here. You're welcome to come to me at any time and ask a question. Lisa Hague and our Vice Chairman of our Transportation Committee can also answer those and we're just glad to help you do that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. No, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that's very helpful to the members. The Representative for now is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise honoring Sarah Lillian Plummer, the last living Tuskegee Airman who was a member of the elite group. She was hired as a time keeper for the famous flyers who trained in World War II and successfully escorting the United States bombers to victory over the Nazi German forces. She passed away on December 8th at the age of 101. Can we have a moment of silence? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Brinnell for that remembrance. Greatest generation, no doubt about it. Representative Reese recognized for, he's going to bring the dean of the house with him. Good stuff. Representative Reese. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise with Representative Gerald Green to stand with my Albany State University family to remember and recognize the life of Joshua Reigns. The Sherat by the President of Albany State University, Dr. Mariam Ross Frederick, freshman student Joshua Reigns passed away at the tragic car accident this past Sunday. Two other students involved in accident are still in the hospital with serious injuries. Joshua was a health science major who had dreams of becoming a nurse. He graduated with Griffin High School Class of 2023 full of energy, hope, and aspirations, which we all should wish for our young people these days. On behalf of the Albany State University family, Representative Gerald Green, Representative David Sampson, and myself, I extend our deepest condolences to the family, his mother, Miss Jeanette Reigns, and his father, Mr. Johnny Reigns. None of us know the day nor the hour, but my God, blessed is your man, his family, and Albany State University. Please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Prayers for the family and for those young folks that are injured, prayers for them to recover. Representative Derek Jackson has recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, colleagues, if I can have your attention. The number of deaths that occur in these United States by guns, over 48,000 American citizens of died by guns. We started off this session, Mr. Speaker, recognizing those who were killed by guns in a line of duty. 118 law enforcement officers died in a line of duty. Nearly 2600 students died by gun. In fact, Mr. Speaker, since Columbine in 1999, more than 300 and 38,000 students experienced gun violence at school, at school, a place where they should be safe, a place that should be conducive for learning. Mr. Speaker, nearly 26,000 gun deaths by suicide, 57% of those suicides done by men. Over 20,000 deaths by gun from homicide, 80% of those homicide done by men. Because the speaker over 686 mass shootings took place last year. I know some probably thinking why are we talking about a national. So let me bring it home. Georgia ranks 20th when it comes to gun violence, averaging 2200 deaths per year. Mr. Speaker, we say we're the number one state to do business. And as the rabbi shared with us all this morning that we should put people over politics. And one way we can do this is create a safer environment for all Georgians. So they, too, do not have a moment of silence because we did not do something that we could have done. We yielded well. Thank you, Representative. Representative Gladney is recognized for an F New Order. Representative Lynn Gladney, there she is. Change your glasses from yesterday, didn't you? I like those, too. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

And y'all know we'll come back next week and encourage out of e-bestables. But if we all change our diets, exercise and eat better, we could definitely live a little longer. But our next Thursday, we want to bring awareness to heart disease and women because it is the sila killer. And in this room, we know we're under a lot of stress and we have balanced that. So maybe one day we'll get some yoga inside the chamber. But for next Thursday, please wear red. Thank you. That's next Thursday. Thursday a week. Chairman Hart Newton. Oh, yeah, you've got the blood. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is just a reminder that starting tomorrow in between CLOB and the Capitol will be an opportunity to donate blood. It's an opportunity to do something that can help save the lives here in the metro area in particular. We have a blood single blood donation can save three lives. So it's an opportunity to make a big difference. I hope you'll join me tomorrow afternoon in between, I'm sorry, from 8 until 5, between CLOB and the Capitol. You can go in and donate blood.
