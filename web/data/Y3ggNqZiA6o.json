as\nmany of you know and have have heard him\nhere before he's been here several times\nbut it's always a pleasure um I enjoy\nhearing him enough that it's it's a\npleasure for me to get up early on a\nSunday morning to drive 30 minutes to\nthe church to go listen to him every\nSunday so um I know it'll be a blessing\nto you as it will be to me uh Dr Benny\nTate's been the pastor of Rock Springs\nChurch in Milner Georgia for 34 years\nand in that time has seen tremendous\ngrowth in the church and the ministry in\nthat church uh one of which is Rock\nSprings Christian Academy which is\nespecially uh important to me as my\nchildren and my two youngest children\nand my two grandchildren go to school\nthere and I'm honored to get to serve on\nthe board of the school along with

gift to\nyou it's unlimited uh I think you'll be\nblessed by it and I hope you'll read it\nand uh following the lead of my my\nfriend chairman Prince yesterday brevity\nis a virtue none of you want to hear me\nyou all need to hear him so with that I\nwill welcome my pastor and my friend\nBenny\nTate thank you thank for being here\nthank you good\nmorning it's an honor to be here as uh\nyou know I've spoken here for uh 34\nyears and I I just thought about\nsomething\ntoday uh when the speaker said lock\nthose\ndoors I thought I'd love to be able to\ndo that at church\namen just lock those doors uh you know\nuh no no no I but it is a it is a real\nprivilege and I appreciate Clint Crow\nand as he was introducing me I thought\nabout something that happened to a\nbasketball coach by the name of John\nWooden some of you probably remember\nthat name he was being introduced one\ntime and the guy just kept on and on and\nand uh he got up and Coach wooden said\nthis he said uh first of all I want to\nask God to forgive my introducer for\npraising me so much and then John Wooden\nsaid I want to ask God to forgive me for\nenjoying it so much so Clint thank you\nfor that introduction you were very very\nkind um I'd like to I'd like to share\nsome verses with you today from uh The\nBook of Matthew Matthew Chapter 2 and\nand I will be\nI will be brief I promise um Matthew\nchapter 2 verse 10 says this it says\nwhen they saw the star they rejoiced\nwith exceeding great joy and when they\nwere coming to the house they saw the\nyoung child with Mary his mother and\nfell down and worshiped him and when\nthey had opened their Treasures they\npresented him Gifts of gold and\nfrankincense and myrr and I want to take\njust a few moments and uh I want us to\nto learn from these wise men I I think\nthere's some things that we can learn\nfrom these wise men I read yesterday\nthat the number one gift to buy for\nChristmas is gift cards and I heard\nabout an elderly lady who did just that\nshe bought a bunch of gift cards and she\ngot her Christmas cards and in every\nChristmas card she she wrote these words\nbuy your own gift this year buy your own\ngift this year she mailed all of her\ncards out but she didn't get any\nresponse and about two weeks after\nChristmas she opened a drawer and she\nfound all those gift\ncards so everybody got a Christmas card\nthat said byy your own gift uh uh this\nyear here's what I want to talk to you\nthe wise men were\nwise and I think they teach us a lot\nabout giving gifts I really do I think\nthey teach us some things that we can\nlearn about Christmas and giving gifts\nthe first thing I think we can learn\nfrom the wise men is this this year\nlet's give an unexpected gift let's give\nan unexpected gift we can all agree that\nMary and Joseph were a poor family as a\nsacrifice for Jesus they weren't able to\noffer up a lamb they offered up total\ndos and when these men arrived from\nPersia bringing Gifts of gold and\nfrankincense and myrr I don't think\nnobody was expecting that kind of gift\nit was certainly a unexpected gift my\nmother's birthday is on October the 20th\nand for years I would send my mother $20\nand then later it became $50 on her\nbirthday on October the 20th but my\nbirthday is on November the 9th and what\nmy mother probably did for 20 years is\nshe would take the $20 bill she would\nget it on October the 20th in Middle\nTennessee and then she would mail it\nback down here on November the\n9th now I don't think either one of us\nhad done any giving it was just a gift\nfor a gift gift gift and we give a lot\nof gift for gift gift gifts but I pray\nthis year that we would give somebody an\nunexpected gift I love what John Wooden\nsaid he said you can't live a perfect\nday without doing for someone who will\nnever be able to repay you I want to\nencourage this year let's give somebody\nan unexpected gift because we really\nhaven't given until we give an\nunexpected gift the second thing I\nlearned from the wise men is why don't\nwe give a gift that will\nlast why don't we give a gift that will\nlast that a gift that will last beyond\nus few years ago Pastor Cameron and I\nwent to\nOklahoma and we had lunch with a guy by\nthe name of David Green you may not know\nthat name but David green and his wife\nwhen I sat down with him I said to him I\nsaid my wife helped make you a\nbillionaire he started Hobby Lobby\nand during that lunch David Green said\nto me he said pastor we get so caught up\non things but there's only two things\nthat are going to last\nforever I appreciate the capital but by\nthe way it's not going to last\nforever I appreciate the Democrats I\nappreciate the Republicans but by the\nway that's that's not going to last\nforever there's only two things that's\ngoing to last\nforever that's Souls of people and the\nword of\nGod I just want to challenge us this\nyear not only give an unexpected gift\nbut give a gift that will last the third\nthing I see\nquickly is giving changes\nus giving changes\nus these wise men came and the Bible\nsays after they gave the gift they left\na different way see get ERS never have\nenough but givers always have\nenough and I want to be like Bill bright\nI want to do my giving while my hands\nare still\nwarm Somebody almost clapped that's a\nfirst I I want to do my giving while my\nhands are still warm because ladies and\ngentlemen when God blesses us he has\nmore than us in\nmind what do the wise men teach us they\nteach us to give an unexpected gift they\nteach us to give a gift that will last\nwe're still talking about it 2,000 years\nlater they teach us that giving changes\nus but then there's the last thing that\nthey teach us they teach us that Christ\nis truly the greatest gift Tri Christ is\ntruly the greatest gift I I hope you\nenjoy your\nbook somebody met me in the hall and\nuh I said to them I said uh have you\nread my last book they said I sure hope\nso I shouldn't be hard on my book it's\nthe type of book once you lay it down\nit's hard to pick it back up it's really\na unique\nbook I hope you enjoy the book I would\nask you to pray for me I I I I close\nwith this story I've I'm uh having to\nstay pretty close to my notes because\nI've had torn retinas in both\neyes and uh these torn retinas in both\neyes reminded me of a story I I heard\nabout a young girl that was\nblind and she was blind and she was\nbitter maybe I would be bitter too if I\nwas\nblind but she was just bitter about life\nand she had a boy boyfriend and he loved\nher deeply and she said if I could if I\ncould see the world I'd marry you but\nshe was just bitter because she was\nblind and apparently somebody donated\ntheir\neyes and through transplants and through\nadvancement she was able to get those\neyes and she was able to\nsee and once she got those eyes what she\ndidn't know she saw her boyfriend\nwho wanted to marry her deeply and he\nwas blind\ntoo and when she saw\nhim maybe he was kind of like me or\nClint she didn't want to\nmarry she said no I'm I'm not interested\nin marrying\nyou and she walked away and she she left\nhim he sent her a letter lately later\nand said I sure do love you and I hope\nlife goes well for you and uh P.S I hope\nyou enjoy my\neyes it was\nneat it was\nsacrificial that he gave his eyes but I\nwant to just remind you on this\nChristmas somebody gave more than their\neyes they gave their\nlife they gave their life life for you\nso this year as you put your presence\nunder the tree I just want to remind you\nthat God placed his present on a tree\nand that greatest gift was the Lord\nJesus Christ let us\npray Lord I Thank you for this day and I\nthank you for speaker Burns I thank\nthank you for the privilege of all these\nyears getting to come here these people\nmean something to me Lord I love every\none of them it matters not to me whether\nthey be Democrat whether they be\nRepublican whether they be independent I\npray your blessings upon their family\nGod it's a sacrifice for these men and\nwomen to serve and they'll be right back\nin January serving again so I ask you to\nbe with them I ask you to be with their\nfamily those that are struggling during\nthis holiday season meet the needs of\ntheir families sons and daughters that\nmaybe are going through a difficult

for your consideration\nhouse Bill 1X which of pass will adopt a\nnew set of districts for the Georgia\nhouse and we've put that up on the\nscreens there for y'all to see the\nproposed map that would be enacted by\nthat uh by that bill um first a little\nhistory to set this in context on\nOctober 26 2023 judge Steven Jones judge\nof the United States district court for\nthe Northern District of Georgia entered\nan opinion and memorandum of decision in\nwhich he ruled that the house district\nMaps we approved in 2021 violate section\ntwo of the Voting Rights act as a result\nhe ordered that new maps must be drawn\nand instead of drawing them himself\nwhich he could have done without\nallowing us any input he kindly allowed\nus to remedy the violation by drawing\nnew maps\nourselves judge Jones also thoughtfully\ngave us specific guidance and how we can\ncomply with his order to clarify the\nmanner in which we can remedy the\nviolation ourselves judge Jones wrote\nthat and I am quoting from the opinion\non page\n509 the remedy involves two additional\nmajority black house districts in South\nMetro Atlanta one additional majority\nblack house district in West Metro\nAtlanta and two additional majority\nblack house districts in and around\nmaking bib so as we as a state hope to\nbetter Alabama in a certain sporting\ncontest this weekend we will not follow\nthe example of their legislature in the\nlack of seriousness and respect we\nAccord a thorough and detailed decision\nof a federal judge whom I think all of\nus respect and admire very much and I\nknow I do we will comply the bill you\nhave before you will adopt a map that\ndoes just that it fully complies with\njudge Jones's order as judge Jones\ninstructed this map enacts five new\nmajority black districts in South Metro\nit creates house District 74 and 117\nlet's move to the second um map in the\npacket\nif you'll zoom in a little more for me\nthat's good so 70 uh if you'll move to\nthe South a little thank you so 74 is\nsort of the light green one and 117 is\nthe brown one and about this hole right\nthere and about the center of the\nscreen and met in West Metro it creates\nhouse district 64 if you'll move down\njust a little bit other way I'm sorry\nyou can see 64 is over there in Douglas\nCounty and it's sort of in the the taupe\ncolor as\nwell and then in mon bib I'm I'm asking\nyou to shuffle around one more time down\ntowards mon area it creates house\nDistrict 145 and house district 149 all\nof these have majority Black age\npopulation voting age populations judge\nJones ordered five new majority black\ndistricts and this plan creates and\nestablishes five new majority black\ndistricts and it decreases the number of\nmajority white districts by five as you\nknow we cannot have\n185 house districts we are limited to\n180 so to make up for that we make that\nadjustment it does not purport to tell\njudge Jones that we know better than he\ndoes and that we've done something\ndifferent but better that he should\naccept his equivalent without explaining\nhow it's equivalent this plan doesn't do\nthat instead it follows his\norder this is the only plan presented to\nthe redistricting committee that\ncomplies with judge Jones's order now as\nyou might expect creating five new\ndistricts was very disruptive to our\nexisting districts there are significant\nRipple effects especially when you\ncreate five districts at one time Ripple\neffects result primarily from\nconstitutional and legal requirements\nthat the districts be the same size as\nfar as the population is concerned now\nwe are allowed some statistical\ndeviation and in Georgia we have\ntraditionally limited ourselves to plus\nor minus\n1% so once we took areas from existing\ndistricts to create the new five\ndistricts we had to add population to\nthose existing districts from which we\ndrew the new ones so that their\npopulation would get back up to within\nthe\ndeviation which by the way as you know\nthe ideal size is\n5951 so that's what we were shooting for\nso as a result we had to borrow or not\nborrow we had to redraw the districts so\nthat we took areas and population from\nuh adjoining districts from the\nneighbors and then the neighboring\ndistricts were short so we had to take\nfrom their neighbors and that process\ncontinued until the ripples effectively\nrun out or you Circle back around and\nand result in parity\nas we went we followed our existing\ntraditional redistricting principles to\nwork on the remaining districts these\nprinciples include maintaining District\npopulations to deviations less than plus\nor minus one limiting additional split\ncounties we only added a single County\nsplit in this plan drawing the new\ndistricts by utilizing the most recent\nprecincts from County government which\nmakes it easier on our local election\nofficials going forward ensuring all the\ndistricts were contiguous that they all\nwere reasoning compact in shape and\nensuring that communities of Interest\nare protected as far as\npossible and we did try to the extent we\ncould to avoid unnecessary pairing of\nincumbents now much has been made of the\nfact that this plan does admittedly pair\nit does include several incumbent\npairings which is not surprising when we\nhad to reconfigure these districts after\nadding five new ones and the pairings do\npain me\ngreatly I wish that I could add five new\ndistricts without any pairings or\ndrastic changes but I could not find a\nway to do it and contrary to assertions\nthat we're being overly partisan we did\nnot inflict political casualties solely\non the opposing party we inflicted\ndamage on both we tried to take some of\nof that uh fire\nourselves as we went through the process\nhowever our primary overriding objective\nwas to comply with the Court's\norder five additional majority black\ndistricts in specified areas now much\nhas been made of process here and giving\nsome rulings I reluctantly had to make\ntoday I suspect much will be made of it\ntoday we have been accused at times of\nmoving too fast and not being\ntransparent and I concede that we have\nhave been moving quickly but I'm\nreminded of one of my quotes when a\nLouisiana politician once promised\nduring a campaign that he would be as\nhonest as the times will\nallow we're under a court imposed\ndeadline we did not receive the Court's\norder until October 26 and we\nimmediately began drawing and released a\nplan on November 28th two days before\nany alternate plans and we've been as\nopen as we could be under the\ncircumstances we're under a deadline\nhere we got until next week to get this\nplan and two other plans\napproved we held two hearings we allowed\nnumerous parties to\nspeak we established and maintain a\nportal for public comment and we allowed\nan alternate plan to be voted on\nyesterday even though the bill enacting\nit no bill enacting it had been filed or\neven assigned to the committee now this\nmorning we attempted to allow another\nopportunity for votes on Alternate plans\nbut when we got in the committee room it\nbecame apparent to me that the documents\nthat were being presented in order to\nachieve certain intended objectives did\nnot match the intentions of the sponsor\nand that was completely I'm sure\nunintended was not\nintentional because these things happen\nwhen you're trying to get stuff done\nfast and our rules are intended to make\nsure that we don't make mistakes when\nwe're in a hurry and I did not feel that\nI knew what we were voting on I didn't\nthink the documents match what the\ndesires were and so for that reason I\nRuled reluctantly ruled those motions\nout of\norder now so in the time constraints\nwe've had we've been as transparent as\ndeliberate as the times will allow to\nquote the gentleman from Louisiana now I\ndon't mean to complain about the Court's\nimposing a deadline I understand the\nneed need for it and under the\ncircumstances it's reasonable but that\ndoes limit our ability to take more\ntime um that that deadline is there for\nHonor for us to honor and respect not to\ndisregard and we got to meet it and as I\nsaid it's seven days away and we still\nhave two other plans to consider so we\nhad to move with all deliberate haste\nthe stakes are high here and we need to\nact the court will not give us another\nchance to draw these plans if we don't\nget it right the court will appoint\nsomeone to draw plans or Draw the plans\nitself I take seriously my obligation to\nthe court and to each of\nyou members of both\nparties to prepare and present maps that\ncomply with the Court's order I think\nit's in our all of our best interest to\ndo that where I could accommodate\nrequests from you without jeopardizing\npotential Court approval of the plan\nbecause that is the primary goal Court\napproval I've tried to accommodate you\nwhen you've asked where I did not feel\nthat route was possible given the\noverarching primary objective of\ncomplying with judge Jones\norder I decline the request and I'm\ntruly sorry I could not accommodate\nevery\nrequest I hope all of you know I care\nand respect each and every one of you\neven when we disagree and we do that a\nlot like most\nfamilies but our primary task here today\nis to comply with the court order this\nplan complies with judge Jones's order\nit fulfills Our obligation\nand I ask that you vote in favor of it\nMr Speaker I'll you have for\nquestions gentleman yield I yield you go\nfor a question Mr chairman I thank you\nI'll just say before we take question\nI'll thank you for your work I know you\nput you put in a lot of hours um and um\nwe do

question gentleman recognized\ndoes the gentleman yield I yield yes sir\num given what we learned yesterday at\nthe Committee hearing isn't it true that\nthis Republican map still violates\nsection of the voting right act well I\ndon't believe it does and more\nimportantly I don't believe it violates\nthe judge's order unlike when we're\ndrawing maps from scratch we're are not\nacting in a vacuum of trying to\ninterpret the Voting Rights Act we have\nthe benefit of a an expert who also has\nthe force of law behind him judge Jones\nand he has told us what to do and these\nplans comply with that order in my\nopinion do you yeld one more time I\ncertainly will all right um so Brian\nSals um opened it up um to you yesterday\nthat this map if we move forward with it\ndoes in fact violate the voting right\nact and you are my acknowledged that\nyesterday I acknowledge his opinion yes\nsir I don't agree with\nit\nokay thank you repres represent\nrepresentative\nRees is recognized for a question to\nyour right thank you Mr Speaker with the\nchairman youer two questions about\ntraditional redistricting principles yes\nsir uh Mr chairman is it not true that\nthe bill before us uh reduces the number\nof County splits by one County from the\n2021 redistricting yes that's my\nunderstanding yes sir and is it also\ntrue that your bill made every effort to\nreduce the number of incumbent pairings\nin compliance with uh in the course of\ncomplying with judge Jones lengthy order\nwe did yes sir and it was we did thank\nyou Mr chairman thank\nyou gentleman yel for one more I will\nyes sir let's\nsee the lady from the 47th the uh protim\nof this this house representative Jan\nJones protim is recognized for a\nquestion thank you m thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the gentleman yield yes\nma'am uh Mr chairman just so I\nunderstand you spoke with both\nRepublicans and Democrats as you were\nworking on this plan right that is\ncorrect does gentleman further yield I\ndo yes ma'am thank you and you drew this\nplan in the reapportionment office with\nutilizing Miss Gina R is that correct\nyes ma'am I did and you were able to\nincorporate suggestions of both\nRepublicans and Democrats into this plan\nis that true I was to some extent do and\nand finally I'm assuming that you and\nperhaps you can clarify you had requests\nfrom both Republicans and Democrats that\nyou were unable to put into the final\nplan much to your regret yes ma'am\nthat's correct thank\nyou Mr chairman we have a couple of\nhours here we can continue to discuss\nthis plan so um I appreciate you taking\nthe\nquestions uh at this point do you have\nany further comments before we hear from\nsome other folks on this bill I do not\nMr Speaker and we'll yield the well I\nask your favorable consideration of\nHouse Bill 1ex thank\nyou the gentleman jul well thank you for\nyour\nremarks now we have a one hour for those\nopposed allocated for those opposed to H\nbe 1X and one hour of for those in favor\nso at this time I will recognize whip\npark for whatever portion of that hour\nhe would like to take whip Park is\nrecognized thank you Mr\nSpeaker colleagues I rise in opposition\nto House Bill 1 EX for two\nreasons first this Republican map\nis\nunlawful it is a map that judge Jones\ncan and should\nreject\nsecond this map is an\nundemocratic\nunamerican blatant exercise of partisan\ngerrymandering that harms the freedom of\nGeorgians to elect their candidate of\nchoice I appreciate the majority party's\neffort to comply with judge Jones's\norder however under existing law the\nproposed Republican map does not comply\nwith judge Jones order to draw five\nadditional majority minority districts\ninstead the Republican map actually\ndraws only a net of three additional\nmajority minority districts let me\nexplain the Republican map creates five\nnew majority black districts but it\ntakes takes away two majority minority\ndistricts and fast growing to cab and\nGwynette counties judge Jones ordered\nthis body to take five steps forward and\ntwo steps back one of those steps back\nis house District 81 which is a majority\nminority District in Northern decab\nCounty under existing law in the 11th\nCircuit Court of Appeals this district\nis clearly protected by the Voting\nRights Act\nit's a district in which Black and\nHispanic voters work together and have\nthe opportunity to elect candidates of\ntheir choice but the Republican map\ntakes away that choice and moves the\ndistrict to the South Metro area to\nprotect a white\nincumbent the second step back is house\ndistrict 105 in gwet County this is a\nmajority minority District where black\nHispanic and Asian voters work together\nand have the opportunity to elect C\ncandidates of their choice but the\nRepublican map floods the district with\nwhite Republican voters and takes that\nopportunity\naway those two takeaways make the\nRepublican map an unlawful map it's a\nmap that again judge Jones can and\nshould\nreject I think in this moment it's\nimportant to pause and recog recognize\nour history to know where we've come\nfrom to be honest about the mistakes and\nsins of the past to ensure we do not\nrepeat\nthem since\n1965 the state of Georgia was placed\nunder the pre-clearance requirement of\nthe Voting Rights Act due to a history\nof discriminatory voting practices and\ndisenfranchisement of African-American\nvoters including but not limited to\nliteracy tests po TX taxes intimidation\nand violence unfair registration\npractices and\ngerrymandering the pre-clearance\nprovision found in section five of the V\nof the Voting Rights Act required\ncertain jurisdictions with a\ndemonstrated history of voting\ndiscrimination to obtain Federal\napproval or pre-clearance before\nimplementing any changes to their voting\nlaws or\nprocedures for nearly 50 years 50 years\nGeorgia voters were under the protection\nof pre-clearance until five Republican\nnominated Supreme Court Justices gutted\nthe Voting Rights Act in 2009 in the\n2013 Shelby County V holder decision for\nthe first time since\n1965 the state of Georgia was able to\ndraw their legislative maps without\nfirst obtaining Federal approval what\ndid the Republican majority do well we\nall know what happened to next two years\nago in 2021 Republicans many here in\nthis body passed unlawful maps for\ncongress the state senate and the State\nHouse Maps struck down by a federal\njudge for being drawn in a racially\ndiscriminatory Manner and here we find\nourselves under court order to comply\nwith the Voting Rights Act to draw Fair\nmaps that do not discriminate against\nany\nGeorgian unfortunately it seems we are\nrepeating the mistakes of our dark past\nunder Republican control of the state of\nGeorgia not only are these Maps\nunlawful in order to cling to power and\nmaintain an unrepresentative majority\nthat does not reflect our great state\nthis map engages in blatant partisan\nJerry mandering with districts that very\nclearly disregard traditional\nredistricting principles of compactness\nand communities of interest in multiple\ndistricts to put it plainly it seems\nRepublicans are trying to remedy their\nracial discrimination with partisan\ngerrymandering again it seems\nRepublicans are trying to remedy their\nracial discrimination with partisan\ngerrymandering why because partisan\ngerrymandering is legal according to\nfive Republic nominated Supreme Court\nJustices who incorrectly decided that\nclaims of unconstitutional partisan\nJerry mandering are not subject to\nFederal Court\nreview Jerry mandering whether it is\nracial or partisan is deeply\nundemocratic and unamerican because it\nundermines the principles of a fair\nrepresentation and distorts the\nDemocratic process the Distortion of\nelectoral outcomes such as a\ncongressional map that creates nine\nRepublican and five Democratic districts\nin a 50-50 swing state that elected a\nDemocratic president and two Democratic\nUnited States senators and back-to-back\nelections erodes the confidence of\nAmerican voters it undermines the\nfoundational Democratic principle of one\nperson one vote this manipulation\nFosters greater polarization and\npartisanship that ultimately makes our\nnation\nweaker it is sad to see that the\nRepublican Party The Party of Abraham\nLincoln who freed the slaves has become\nthe party of trump the party of election\ndenialism and Insurrection the party of\nracial discrimination and now\ngerrymandering I hope y'all find your\nway back I hope y'all get through your\nCivil War and I hope the anti-democracy\nauthoritarian faction of your party is\nexpelled\nin a two-party system I welcome the\ncompetition of ideas to see who can best\nserve the people and perfect our Union\nby ensuring the promise of Freedom\nequality and justice to every\nAmerican unfortunately as demonstrated\nby this unlawful map it seems the\nRepublican party is doubling Down On\nAgain repeating the mistakes of the past\nand pursuit of power the blatant\ndisregard for existing law that protects\nmajority minority districts in Georgia\ndemonstrates an intent to once again\nattack the Voting Rights Act by\nnarrowing its\nprotections it is\nunfortunate that as a Native Sun Georgia\nas a Native Son Of Georgia born and\nraised I have had to repeatedly come\ndown to this well over the past seven\nyears to fight back against Republican\nattacks against our democracy attacks\nagainst the fundamental freedoms and\nrights\nof my fellow Georgians against their\nright to vote and in this case their\nfreedom to elect their candidate of\nchoice Georgians deserve better we can\ndo better than this unlawful Republican\nmap that puts partisan politics before\nthe citizens of Georgia that puts\npolitical party before our\ncountry in the words of John LS\ndemocracy is not a state it is an act\ntoday let us act in the best interest of\nall Georgians by voting no to this\nunlawful map that undermines the freedom\nof our fellow citizens to elect their\ncandidate of choice thank you Mr Speaker\nI yeld the\nwell will park has yielded the\nwell minority leader James Beverly is\nrecognized to speak to the bill leader\nBeverly\nthank you Mr\nSpeaker uh before I get started I want\nto clear the\nrecord something that the chairman of\nthe redistricting committee\nsaid and that is that we had ample\nopportunity to present our\nmap\nthe reality is is that you put an\nartificial\ntimetable on how we had to move through\nthis\nprocess the reality is is that it is not\nup to the Georgia house Democratic\ncaucus to print maps to get the map\ncoincided with a LC number it is up to\nleg Council in the reapportionment\noffice that did not\nhappen I think you did it in good faith\nI think the Republicans did it in good\ngood faith but if you just extended the\ntime just a little bit\nmore we could have made it work where we\nhad an opportunity to present our map\nwhich we believe is the best map for\nGeorgia at this particular time that\nit's that it's\nequal and that it's\njust but that did not\nhappen what is the rush to\njudgment a couple of years ago I\nremember sharing with you that although\nAbraham Lincoln was not necessarily my\nfavorite\nPresident there are notable quotes that\nspeak to the heart of\ndemocracy one being stand with anybody\nthat stands right stand with him while\nhe is right and part with him when he\ngoes\nwrong my dear colleagues I stand once\nagain to say the Democratic caucus must\npart ways with our Republican and\ncolleagues as you will your majority\npower to push through what we believe to\nbe an illegal map in order to maintain\npower at the expense of our fellow\nGeorgians today as a leader of the\ndemocratic caucus I stand before you not\nmerely in political\ncapacity but as a custodian of a\nlegacy a legacy that is steeped in a\nstruggle for equality and and\nJustice we're gathered here to\ndeliberate on a matter of immense\nsignificance the rejin of our\nstate's legislative his house\ndistricts now this historic moment that\nwe find ourselves in right\nnow is an opportunity to write\nhistorical wrongs and to pave the way\nfor a future that honors the diverse\nvoices of our great\nstate an opportunity to remedy some of\nthe wrongs that have been particularly\ndirected toward our africanamerican\nelectorate those who have been\nhistorically\ndisenfranchised stalled from having\nequal access and opportunity to vote and\nselect their candidate of the\nchoice and are justly targeted by\nplacing barriers and stumbling blocks in\ntheir way listen over the past decade\nthere has been a great migration if\ny'all have not realized this there been\na great migration back to Georgia a\nmigration of Black Folk who came from\nthe Northeast back to God's country\nGeorgia there's also been a migration of\npeople of different nations colors and\nCreeds who have come to Georgia because\nthey seek a better\nopportunity and the reality is in that\nopportunity they move into districts\nthat potentially they wouldn't have\nmoved into a 100 years\nago but they have and they moved into\nthese districts and they need\nrepresentation that's what the judge\nordered that this group of folk who\nmoved and migrated around the state of\nGeorgia should have\nrepresentation and the Republican map\ndecided we'll skirt around that just a\nlittle bit to protect potentially some\nof our\nmembers I'm going to say a quote by Dr\nKing and I think now is appropriate to\nsay\nthis as I continue to deliver my speech\nbut I can hear him saying to America and\nI'll say to the Republicans in this\ncaucus in this house our house today\nyou're too\narrogant and unless you change your ways\nI God will rise up and break the\nbackbone of your\npower and place it in the hands of a\nnation that doesn't even know God's\nname be\nstill and know that God is\nGod georg's history while Rich and\nmultifaceted Bears the scars of past\nmarred by racial Injustice\nparticularly in the realm of voting\nrights the disenfranchisement of black\nvoters through mechanisms such as pole\ntaxes literacy test and the white\nprimary was just a denial of rights was\nnot just a denial of rights but a denial\nof\ndignity it is in this context that again\nDr King said our lives begin to end the\nday we become silent about things that\nmatter this\nmatters\nas my learned attorneys will\nsay reasonable Minds can\ndisagree but this is the judge's\norder we ought to\ncomply we should have five\nadditional black districts where black\nfolk can vote now y'all have heard this\nthat oh the Democrats created four\ndistricts it's foolishness we created\nFive we created Five according to the\njudge's\norder and to my attorney colleagues the\nreference would be Bartlett versus\nStrickland as president case law that\ntalks about plurality districts we did\nthat we can keep going further Cooper\nversus Harris there's a whole litania\ncase law that said what we created was a\nfifth district so please please guys\nstart with the\nfoolishness in fact our districts are\nalmost carbon copies of the district\nthat judge Jones approved in his order\nDistrict 145 is a new majority minority\nDistrict located in Bib and hon counties\nthat is a carbon copy a carbon copy of\nthe district that judge Jones approved\nwe didn't move a block not one\nblock District 149 is a new majority\nminority District in bi in the black\nbelt now if y'all don't know what the\nblack belt is is where um where\nslaves that's the culmination of where\nslaves were the black belt is where I\nlive making bib Twigs Wilkerson County\nBalwin counties that only deviates a few\ncensus blocks from the districts that\njudge Jones approved those folk we need\nrepresentation 100 years is\nenough and why did we move those few\ncensus blocks here's why we moved them\nto protect our Republican\ncolleague who represents\nmilleville who would have otherwise been\nput in that new Democratic\nleaning\nDistrict district 117 is a new majority\nminority District in Henry County that\nalso is a carbon copy a carbon copy of\nthe m majority minority District that\njudge Jones\napproved District 61 and our map is a\nnew majority minority District in\nDouglas and Cobb counties that is also\ncarbon\ncopy of what judge\nJones approved and finally District 74\nis a new majority minority District in\nHenry and spalon counties that satisfies\njudge Jones's order for a fifth new\nopportunity District in that\narea I'm want to pause for a second\nbecause\nthat\ndistrict there would be one Republican\nmember who would be sacrificed in that\nDistrict\npotentially but we don't know what that\nDistrict would vote for because through\nthis political Jerry am manding y'all\nmoved it so that white Republicans could\nvote for that\nmember this Great Migration I've learned\none thing and one thing only if you can\nmove where you want to move you\nmove but we should not be moving\npeople at\nall to satisfy the need of a\nrepresentative if you don't like where\nyou live\nmove simple\nif you don't like the district that\nyou're representing right now move and\nlet somebody who represents that\nDistrict step\nin it should not be on us to make the\npeople go with us we should represent\nthe people where we are and that\nDistrict that one District the sacrifice\nof that one person is going to put us\nall in Jeopardy because of the ripple\neffect that you did to the rest of the\nmembers in this house and the judge a\nspecial master has to draw a\nmap because of the ripple effect that\nyou created trying to protect one you\nsacrificed the\nwhole now when the special Master\ndecides to draw this map which we\nbelieve will happen because not only did\nyou uh not comply with his order you\nbroke the\nlaw\nyou broke the\nlaw because Coalition majority minority\ndistricts are\nprotected and it's gone on for 20 years\nor so it's protected so you can't say we\ncomplied and break the law it's not how\nAmerica works it's certainly not how\nGeorgia works and it's certainly not\nwhat judge Jones\norder\nwhat I would say to you and and in\nconclusion is\nthis the Civil Rights Movement which\nfound fertile ground in the heart of\nGeorgia was a testament to the\nunyielding Spirit of those who fought\nfor\njustice the Voting Rights Act of 1964\n65 emerged from this struggle it was a\nBeacon of\nHope the task of reining our Maps we\nmust do so Within acute awareness of our\npast and a Resolute commitment to\nEquitable and a just\nfuture to my\ncolleagues I Echo the words of President\nLyon B Johnson the vote is the most\npowerful instrument ever devised by man\nfor breaking down\nInjustice we have have decisions to make\nnow won't T cuz I know y'all are under a\ntime\ncrunch but this is the time to do what's\nright to contemplate the reality of\nwhere we go from here as a state of\nGeorgia the number one state to do\nbusiness unless you poor and you get\nsick but we'll deal with that next\nweek this is our time to say to Georgia\nto be\nResolute in this moment to say we hear\nyou and if we want to represent you then\nwe stand firm on the ideals and\nprinciples of Georgia and\nJustice equality and\nfairness to my Republican colleagues you\nhave a few moments please don't violate\nthe trust of the Georgians who moved\nhere looking for a better opportunity\nbecause you wish to protect one member\nMr Speaker I yield the\nwell the gentleman has yielded the\nwell minority minority leader\nBeverly now we'll move on to those in\nfavor of the proposition hb1 ex Rec\nrecognize chair lady Camp to speak to\nthe\nbill good morning thank you Mr Speaker\nand and thank you members representative\nVI yield I forgot to tell you you have\nup to one hour that will be allocated to\nthose speaking in favor I hope you don't\ntake that long no sir I will not thank\nyou for that good morning members and Mr\nSpeaker um when I qualified to run for\nmy house seat March of 2020 of course it\nwas with the map that was current and\nthen we redistricted in 2021 so I\nqualified on another District map March\nof 2022 now I will have the opportunity\nto qualify again on a third map March of\n2024 this time in a district where I am\npaired with another member of my own\nparty who is my friend and respected\ncolleague three different District maps\nin the course of four years that's a\nlot this situation deeply saddens me\nbecause I truly care about the people I\nrepresent working diligently to know and\nmeet the needs of the citiz citizens who\nplace their trust in me in each election\nit is my honor to represent the interest\nof Lamar Pike and Upson counties and a\nprivilege to serve in this role these\ncounties each have individual unique\nneeds and challenges that I am committed\nto represent here under the gold\nDome unfortunately to meet the\nrequirements set forth in the detailed\norder by judge Jones regarding the 2021\nredistricting drastic changes had to\nhappen in many districts my district is\na prime example emotions cannot rule in\nthis important task with a looming\ndeadline there is a judge's order with a\nspecific set of instructions to the\ngeneral assembly for the requirements\nfor the new house Maps which hb1 X\nbefore today meets I observe and follow\nthe law and court orders I'm sure\neveryone in this room does the same\nthere are three branches of government\nfor this very reason the judges order is\nnot up for debate today it is if we as a\nbody are going to comply with the order\nis for this reason I'm voting yes on\nhouse redistricting bill\nhb1 and I ask for your favorable\nconsideration on this Bill thank\nyou Mr Speaker I yield The Well the lady\nhas yielded the well thank\nyou chair now recognizes uh\nrepresentative Sue Hong to speak to the\nbill one of the governor's floor\nleaders representative\nHong thank you Mr Speaker and good\nmorning colleagues I stand before you\nthis morning to speak in favor of\nchairman leverett's House Bill\n1ex the right to vote stands as a\nCornerstone a fundamental pillar upon\nwhich our society rests as the Supreme\nCourt said and y wo versus Hopkins in\n1886 the right to vote is regarded as a\nfundamental political right because it\nis preservative of All\nrights unlike many of you I wasn't born\nwith the right to vote in the United\nStates as an immigrant I had to wait my\ntime I had to take a test to become a\ncitizen before I could vote so I\nunderstand the tremendous importance of\nvoting and having my voice heard with my\nvote voting matters because it's the way\nevery person's voice is heard regardless\nof background or\ncircumstance voting matters because it's\nthe power each person has to elect their\nrepresentatives and voting matters\nbecause it's how we can shape the\ntrajectory of our community and our\nstate and when the Supreme Court said\nthe right to vote is preservative of all\nof our other rights it meant just\nthat without the right to vote our other\nrights can quickly disappear and we\njeopardize our free\nSociety now this body worked hard to\ncreate District maps in\n2021 that fairly represented all\nvoters as I look out at this body of\nRepresentatives I see a diverse group of\nRepresentatives with backgrounds and\nbeliefs who I truly believe represent\ntheir constituents very\nwell unfortunately and respectfully\njudge Jones did not agree with this\ncurrent body of\nRepresentatives and as an attorney I do\nunderstand that when a judge tells you\nin detail to do something in an order\nyou\ncomply judge Jones specifically stated\nto create five majority black districts\nnot opportunity districts or Coalition\ndistricts or crossover districts\nspecifically five majority black\ndistricts and there's a reason why\njudges put specifics in their order and\nyou must\ncomply chairman leverett's house Bell\n1ex map does just that it complies with\neverything that the judge required of us\nit also upholds our other traditional\nredistricting principles things like\nensuring that community of interests are\nproperly represented and\naddressed and reducing the number of\nCounty splits on the plan and using\nPrecinct boundaries that lessen the\nburden on Election\nofficials\nhb1 map upholds the principle principles\nof equal representation and ensures each\nvoters can have their voices\nheard therefore I urge you members of\nthis house in joining me to vote Yes for\nHouse Bill 1ex thank you Mr Speaker and\nI yield The\nWell the lady has yielded the\nwell that\nconcludes those that signed up to speak\nboth and in favor of and opposed this\ntime we'll move on we do not have a\nMinority Report we will move on to the\nchairish time who have a total of 20\nminutes Mr\nchairman and I hope you don't take that\nlong you talked quite a while\nearlier chairman Leverett is recognized\nto speak to the Bill thank you Mr\nSpeaker I would say I'll be brief but as\nan attorney I know that doesn't carry a\nlot of credulity\nwell it was interesting to me if I could\njust respond that we were accused of\nbeing overtly and shamelessly partisan\nbut the most partisan comments I heard\ncoming from the podium in this chamber\ncame from members of the opposing party\nnot from anyone who is in the the\nmajority\nparty um and I would submit if we truly\nwanted to be overtly and excessively\npartisan we would have paired entirely\nmembers of the opposition but we didn't\ndo that we tried to share some of that\nof that burden if you\nwill now up to\num as far as some of the comments about\ntimeliness I mean I I the only thing I\nwill say is I think we know the rules\nand we know that to submit a bill to\nredistri to to present a plan to\nredistricting you have to have a bill\nyou got to draw the bill we've had the\norder for about a month now we all knew\nthis was coming so I I I I don't know\nwhat more to do about that well frankly\nI do you could allow a motion without a\ndocument and that's what I did in\ncommittee yesterday and nobody made the\nmotion I indicated I was going to\nentertain such a motion and no one made\nit without a document and the document\nthat was proposed today didn't do that\neven so again I I think I've stated my\nposition there and as far scump that's\nall I have to say about that\num now the only other plan that was\nproperly submitted to the committee was\npresented yesterday and the presenters\nacknowledged that the plan did not\ncreate five majority black districts as\nthe order required just if you'd roll\nthat beautiful um order footage this is\nfrom page 509 of Judge Jones's order the\nremedy involves an additional majority\nblack congressional district in West\nMetro two additional Senate districts in\nSouth Metro we're getting to that later\ntwo additional majority black house\ndistricts in South Metro Atlanta wanted\nadditional majority black house district\nin West Metro Atlanta and two additional\nmajority black house districts in and\naround making biip our plan the hb1 ex\ndoes that I don't think judge Jones\ncould be clear about it I do not want to\nbe in a hearing in a remedial phase\nhaving to explain to judge Jones how I\nthought he really meant something else\nthan that that's just not a good\nposition to be in I'm not an expert in\nthe Voting Rights Act but I know a\nlittle bit about Judges and and I don't\nthink they enjoy it when you either\ndisregard their orders or try to\nconstrue them in a manner that that is\nunreasonable and when they're unhappy\nthat usually falls upon the person who\ndid the the improper construing our plan\ncomplies with that with that order it\ncomplies with that provision and that's\nclear guidance that judge Jones kindly\ngave\nus um now I I heard some some comment\nabout how these some of the districts in\nour plan didn't actually comply with the\norder because they weren't majority\nblack but they were every one of them\nwas um we' we've vetted that with Miss\nWright we've confirmed the data and they\ncomply\num and the argument\nwas was made that we somehow broke the\nlaw by complying with the order or by\nnot doing something else other than what\njudge Jones required\nwell in the defense of the people making\nthat argument I think what they are\nsaying is Judge Jones's order is not\nexactly in compliance with the Voting\nRights Act he misconstrued the Voting\nRights Act so we ought to do what we\nbelieve should be done instead of what\nhe ordered I don't want to go into court\ntaking that position I just don't think\nthat's a wise approach to getting the\nplans\napproved um and we we retained every\nmajority District we have it does say\nadditional and we created Five\nmore finally just on a personal note I I\nI\nacknowledge you know redistricting judge\nherd used to say about re about well it\nreminds me of a quote judge herd a\nformer member of this body used to say\nabout taking castor\noil he said one of the greatest things\nabout being administered doses of castor\noil is it reminds you of the Finer\nThings in life like the times que the\ndoses of castor\noil that's that's\nredistricting I wish we didn't have to\ndo this I really wish we didn't but\nwe're we've ordered and I I'm I have\ntried as chairman to comply with that\norder in the best way I knew how taking\nadvice of the reapportionment office and\nof counsel and complying with the order\nand complying with the Voting Rights\nAct and I would not not propose\nsomething that I felt harmed any one of\nyou in any\nway unless I felt it was necessary to\ncomply with a court order I don't\nbelieve one can be terribly sentimental\nwhen you're trying to comply with a\ncourt order the people in this\nchamber mean a lot to me\npersonally and I'm being sincere about\nthat we when we were doing this two\nyears ago I went home on the weekend and\nmy mother passed\nunexpectedly and I couldn't come back\nMonday and Tuesday and so\nI stayed home\nobviously till we had the funeral and I\nI think the day I\nmentioned that to one person in this\nchamber\nwithin\nseconds my phone lit up with texts of\ncondolences\nso much so that it basically you\ncouldn't hold the phone it shook off the\ntable this body means a lot to\nme every one of you mean a lot to me\neven when we\ndisagree the thing I really appreciate\nabout the people in this body is we\ndisagree and we do it civy and we still\nremain\nfriends at least we tried to and I know\nin this process it's tough it's easy for\nme to sit up here my district hasn't\nbeen changed it hasn't been\ntouched so that's easy for me to\nsay but but that you folks mean a lot to\nme when she passed one of you wrote me a\nnote a personal note that is one of the\nkindest things I have\never received didn't know you that well\nat that\ntime and I really appreciate it I still\nappreciate\nit and I appreciate this body and the\nthought that I would intentionally try\nto draw somebody out for a reason other\nthan complying with an order is just an\na to me and I would hope you would all\nknow me\nbetter that's what we have to do the\norder the the house bill 1X complies\nwith that order we don't have a lot of\ntime we need to get this\ndone and I ask that you approve and vote\nin favor of House Bill 1 ex so we can\nmove on to the rest of the business we\nhave to finish by the court imposed\ndeadline thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nthe\nwell gentleman's yielded the well\nthere's no doubt of your sincerity or of\nyour work ethic or your hard work thank\nyou for working on this proposition for\nall members of the house that concludes\nall of

had to\nwrong button pushed when I wanted to ask\na question earlier so uh the question\nbecause the the the author of the bill\nstates that it's unintentional but if\nanyone was to look at house district\n93 on this new map is been called a dead\ncat it is the most erroneous Jerry\nMandarin that I probably have\nseen you take a district you go east you\ngo north and then you go west and then\nthere there a district sandwiched in\nbetween I would hope that everyone would\nvote no cuz this map is not only\ndisenfranchising the members the voters\nof DEC Rockdale Newton and ninet it is\naffecting our entire state so this map\nshould go back to the starting point\nbecause I think that's the lady's\nquestion yeah yeah that's the question\nhow 93 alone should send it back well I\nappreciate the lady's\nViewpoint and I'm sure the lady believes\neverything she just\nsaid the lady from the\n56 is recognized for what purpose to she\nrise represented mayor parliamentary\ninquiry State your inquiry thank you Mr\nSpeaker isn't it true that the judge's\norder is not about creating Democrat\ndistricts or repu Republican districts\nit's about creating majority black\ndistricts is that not true I think\nthere's true is it not further I know\nthat to be true is it not further true\nto my colleague is this a further\ninquiry further inquir if I may Mr\nSpeaker you recognized is it not further\ntrue to sit here and say that\nRepublicans are being racist is\ncertainly not true as I am a Republican\nand I am certainly not racist I take\noffense to such statements is that a\nquestion do you have a question if not\nthat is my is that not true I'm sure if\nthe lady so States that's what the lady\ncertainly believes thank you Mr Speaker\nwe're going to take a couple of more and\nthen we're going to close this vote I\nknow this lady has\num Wanted the opportunity to make a\ncomment\nto speak so um chair recognizes lady\nfrom the 108th house District\nrepresentative Clark representative\nClark for what purpose do you rise thank\nyou Mr Speaker parliamentary inquiry\nState your inquiry Mr Speaker is it not\ntrue that there are many iterations of\nmaps that could be drawn that would not\npair six members of the democratic party\ntogether is that not true Mr Speaker I'm\nI'm sure the lady has studied the map\nand studied the state and believes what\nshe says is true thank you for your\npoint we have one more and let's see we\nhave let's hear from some history from\nsomeone who's been around for a couple\nof these for what purpose does the\ngentleman from the 167th house district\nrise chairman parliamentary inquiry\nState your inquiry isn't it true that\nthe last map that a republican majority\nin this house\nDrew my district went from being a part\nof Liberty County to Tiny parts of six\ncounties going all the way from the\ncoast in McIntosh County through Liberty\nlong Brian bulock to the very top of\nkler County to the Emanuel County\nLine isn't that true Mr\nSpeaker I'm sure I remember that\nand I'm glad you had that District when\nyou were a younger man because you would\nhave had trouble covering all of that\nthese days so but you do a great job of\nrepresenting your District I'm not\nsaying that so I'm sure the gentleman\nspeaks the truth we're going to take one\nlast inquiry here I'm going to recognize\nthe gentleman from the 143rd the\nminority leader of this\nhouse thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary\ninquiry State your inquiry is it not\ntrue that the public democrat atic map\nhouse\nmap only\ncreated issues with 23 house\ndistricts is that not true I'm sure if\nthe gentleman so States I won't comment\non that but I'm sure that's what the\ngentleman believes yes is it also not\ntrue Mr Speaker that the Republican map\ncreated problems for 50 plus house\ndistricts is that not\ntrue\nif that's a question finish your inquiry\nthen I'll make a comment Mr Speaker the\ninquiry is this in the in the Democratic\nhouse the public map that is\npublic that we did not couple Democratic\nmembers in the Georgia House of\nRepresentatives is that not\ntrue with the public map I'm not privy\nto your map right now so I'll have to\ntake your word that that's what you did\nlastly Mr Speaker is it not true that\nthat it was\nunnecessary absolute unnecessary to\ncouple Democratic members in the Georgia\nhouse Democratic caucus with the map the\nRepublicans Drew because the judge was\nvery specific in the regions in which he\nidentified is that not true Mr Speaker\nI'm sure the gentleman believes that I\nsaid that was the last one but I think\nif I'm going to hear from the minority\nleader also need to hear from the\nmajority Le gentleman from the 104th\nhouse district leader estra\nparliamentary inquiry stay that inquiry\nMr speaker is not true that the publicly\nreleased map as I understand it was the\nmap that the minority leader presented\nin committee and that was presented on\nthe second day of committee when he was\ngiven an opportunity to present the\nfirst day and that from a study of the\nmap it was acknowledged by all involved\nthat it failed to comply with the\nrequirement from from the judge that we\njust saw projected on the board to\ncreate five districts as outlined it\nonly created four and therefore did not\ncomply with the specific order as\nwritten by the judge is that not\ntrue well I'm sure the gentleman\nunderstands what he's saying and he\nbelieves believes what he's saying and\nso thank you for your inquiry I'll make\none last statement and we're going to\nclose this\nout it has been my intent\nfrom when this process began a few a\nmonth ago or longer in that time frame\nnot quite a month ago to comply with\njudge Jones's\norder and I also\nknow that I have many friends that are\nserving in this General Assembly right\nnow in this\nhouse and my friends on both sides of\nthe aisle have been\nimpacted by this redistricting\nit's not not my choice to be here but\nwe're going to be here and we're doing\nthe work that's been assigned to us\nwe're going to comply with this with\njudge Jones's\norder we're going to create new black\nmajority districts in this state that's\nwhat we were told to do that's what this\nmap does I feel comfortable with this\nmap and we'll move forward so with that\nI thank all the members have voted all\nmembers\nvoted Mr

I'm\ngoing to begin the afternoon orders with\na very somber afternoon order and I'm\ngoing to invite up chairman Martin\nrepresentative\ngamble\nnothing and representative\nMartinez I'll just preface\nthis and chairman Williamson I think we\nall need to stand we've U recently lost\na reverend member of this\nhouse the Reverend chairman Lyn\nWalker your recognized to\nspeak and you gentlemen can all make a\ncomment his um service here was\nexemplary and what a fine fine man he\nwas a fine gentleman who served with\nmany of us in this\nhouse chairman Martin thank you Mr\nSpeaker\num as we all know we got an email from\nthe speaker's office yesterday that we\nlost a former member uh chairman Lynn\nWalker and and of the gentleman are\nstanding with me I'm I perhaps on a\npersonal basis uh didn't\nknow Lynn as well as they did but when\nthe email came across yesterday and and\nwe've lost a number of our\ncolleagues in recent years but when the\nemail came across yesterday I was\nsitting in a chair at\n4:17 at at almost exactly the same place\nthat Lynn Walker sat on on his last days\nyou know in the in the capital before he\nretired in 2011\nand some reason for some reason at that\npoint in that time when I read that it\njust struck\nme the loss that that we feel for for\nour colleagues down here and that we\nfeel throughout our community and it\nmade me think and and it I quite frankly\ngot it me up me mixed up with Randy\nNicks and Lynn Walker but but both those\nmen have have left us and come back and\ndone devotionals and and one of those\ndevotionals we they talked about\nSaturdays and then we we've We've joked\nand and we're all excited about our\nSaturday tomorrow but I want to use that\nas an example\nbecause grasping that with how many\nSaturdays we have\nleft to be intentional what you decide\nto do on that Saturday and every day for\nthat matter but on that Saturday and how\nfortunate we are if if God lets me wake\nup tomorrow and get to four o'clock I'll\nget to go with with my sons and\ngrandsons and family to a ball game that\nI hope they'll remember after I'm long\ngone but I go back to what LM Walker\ntalked about when he was about being\nintentional with what we do and that\njust struck me so much because what we\njust did is very important 11 million\nGeorgians that that's fine but what you\ndo on Saturdays with your family and in\nyour community and what Lynn Walker did\ndown here was important but what he did\nfor his church and his parishioners and\nhis family by being\nintentional every day is so much more\nimportant so Mr Speaker I just wanted to\nshare that and and ask all of us to look\ninside and look to our family members\nand be thankful for the time we have\nbecause time is fleeting that we be\nintention when we leave here and take\nour time and and enjoy it we rush around\ntoo\nmuch um so I would yield at this time to\nthese gentlemen that knew knew Lyn\nWalker much better than me but not one\nof them was more impacted by Lynn Walker\nthan I was and and I hope you'll just\ntake that to heart and be intentional\nwhen you leave here on your Saturdays\nand every day because when we wake up\nthis Sunday morning regardless of what\nhappens in that mercedesbenz\nDome everybody in this building have one\nless Saturday so make the best of it Mr\nSpeaker i y the\nwell chairman Williamson thank you Mr\nSpeaker one of the reasons I'm standing\nhere today is because of Lynn Walker I\nmet him when I was in my business uh in\nmy business career when he came by and\nknocked on my door and told me he was\nrunning to be my state representative\nalong with my area of Walton County at\nthe time I found out quickly that he was\nwas a man of integrity he was an\nencourager and and so many more things\nuh because he was a man of God and I\nshared it to breakfast this morning that\nI know and those of you how many of us\nserve with Lyn Walker it's not going to\nbe a tremendous amount but every one of\nyou your hands up know what a fine man\nhe was he treated everybody with dignity\nand respect um and I shared with some\npeople at a breakfast this morning that\nI know beyond a shadow of a doubt that\nLynn Walker is with the Lord Jesus\nChrist right now that he is fully healed\nand he's in his Heavenly home that all\nof us should aspire to by following the\nwords of Pastor Tate this morning put\nJesus first in your life he he gave it\nall for us so Mr Speaker um this body\nshould uh finally remember the service\nof Lynn his legacy for the people of the\nstate of Georgia Mr Speaker I yield the\nwell let's hear from um one of our Deans\nRay excuse me repres um representative\nWilliams thank you thank you Mr\nSpeaker there

rejoicing\ntoday for the scripture says precious in\nthe sight of the Lord is the death of\none of his Saints and Lynn Walker from\nfrom a spiritual standpoint was a saint\nfor those of you if for no other reason\nto honor the legacy of Lynn Walker and\nThe God he so loved I would come honor\nhim at the prayer convocation that he so\nlong and led so well thank you Mr\nSpeaker are you thank you
