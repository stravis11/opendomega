Happy legislative day too.\nPlease join me in the pledge to our nation's flag.\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America\nAnd to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nAnd now our state's flag.\nThis is a Georgia flag to the principals for which it stands, wisdom, justice, moderation, and courage.\nWell, this is indeed a pleasure today.\nI have the pastor of the day that is Reverend Tom Caruth.\nHe is the pastor at Perry United Methodist Church, where I've attended since I was a child.\nAnd he not only is my pastor, but he is a very good friend of mine.\nReverend Caruth is, he's the senior pastor of Perry Methodist Church.\nHe's a native of Dublin, Georgia.\nHe's a graduate of Dublin High School, Duke University, and\nEmory University's Candler School of Theology.\nBefore entering seminary, he served as youth minister and\npastor churches across Georgia, including Alpha Methodist and\nBloomingdale, and Byron Methodist before coming to Perry\nMethodist Church in 2021.\nTom is married to his wife, Shelly.\nShe's originally from Duluth.\nWe have four children that attend the Westville School,\nHolland, a junior, Olivia, a freshman,\nPresley, a sixth grader who is serving as a page today for us,\nand Dax who is in pre-K.\nPresley's best friend, Shiloh, also from Perry,\nis serving as a page today with her.\nTom's hobbies include preaching sermons\nthat probably should have been five minutes shorter,\nHe says, playing rock music with friends, including my brothers and my sons and eating the\nbest pizza in his life at Ghost Runner's Pizza, who is the proprietors there or my two\nsons Wade and Cody.\nTom is just an outstanding guy, he's very inspirational.\nHis sermons, and his friendship, and his ministry really mean a lot to the Walker family\nand I'm just proud to have him here with us today.\nThank you, Tom.\nGood morning, Mr. President, Mr. President Pro Tem, you know, Senator Larry Walker has\nhas never been President Pro Tem until I became his pastor.\nI don't know if there's a correlation there, and I don't think there is, but it is of note.\nI'm so honored to be here, I'm nervous, but tomorrow I have to guess lecture for my\ndaughter's ninth grade class about religion at her school.\nI'm way more nervous about tomorrow.\nSo I'm actually glad to be a little less nervous today.\nIt's only day two, which means a few things are true.\nI would expect for y'all.\nSome of you, especially, I think there's a couple of servants\nfor the first time.\nYou might feel a little bit like I do,\ngoing, I can't believe I'm here.\nYou know, I already took a selfie a minute ago,\njust to kind of prove it was real.\nYou've probably taken a picture of your name on your desk\nand texted it to some friends or family saying,\nI can't believe this is real.\nMaybe others, if you remember that time.\nFor others of you, it's not your first rodeo, right?\nYou know where to park.\nYou know which meetings really start on time\nand which ones aspire to.\nYou already have a strong opinion about the coffee.\nYou know that by day two, the excitement is gonna start\nto wear off and it's gonna give way to something called work.\nScripture, it turns out, has something to say to both the first\ntimers and the old hats.\nIn the letter of James, it says, if any of you lacks wisdom,\nyou should ask God, who gives generously to all without\nfinding fault.\nThat's a great promise.\nIf you lack wisdom, ask God who gives generously to all, no fault, like no problem.\nHe doesn't say if you lack intelligence, he doesn't say if you lack experience.\nHe definitely doesn't say if you lack confidence.\nJames says if you lack wisdom, because wisdom is different.\nis what helps those who are new hold on to the all of this moment without being overwhelmed\nby it. And wisdom is what helps those who have been here a while keep this work from\nbecoming old hat. Familiarity is a gift. I have been here one time before several years\nago at the invitation of Senator Walker. I was glad I knew where the parking place was\ntoday because there was so much traffic and I came in on two wheels. I was grateful for\nthat familiarity, but as you may know, the phrase is familiarity breeds unfamiliarity\nand unfamiliarity breeds contempt. What once felt weighty, weighty can begin to feel\nroutine, what once felt sacred, can feel procedural.\nSo wisdom is what restores gravity to work we've done many times before.\nRecently I heard someone say, you know, speaking about American government, and I know we're all\ngrateful for our country and for grateful for the principles of our state, said, you know,\nIt's not Congress or the Senate or the courts that keep democracy functioning the way it\nshould be.\nIt's not the Senate, it's not the House, it's not the courts, it's senators, it's representatives,\nit's members of the court, it's judges operating with integrity, acting from principle, acting\nfrom character. That really spoke to me. It's not the system. It's not the rules. It's you.\nYou called to this moment. People showing up. People exercising restraint. People choosing\njustice over convenience. People working together, even when agreement is hard. Every one of you,\nregardless of party or tenure or title, brings something irreplaceable to this room today.\nAnd every day, your conscience, your moral compass, your willingness to listen, your ability to say,\nI might be wrong. One time I preached a sermon and somebody came up to me afterwards and said,\nPastor, I would agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong. That's good, isn't it?\nDo we have the ability to say, hey, I might be wrong, or hey, let's slow this down.\nOr we can do better.\nThat's why James' invitation means so much.\nWisdom is not certainty, it's not having all the answers.\nWisdom often begins by the weight of a decision saying, I need help with this.\nI was in seminary at Candler, living in Atlanta.\nI happened to be in recovery from alcoholism myself.\nI wasn't supposed to be here, you know what I'm saying?\nI can't believe my life is the way it is today.\nSo I'm a member of a 12-step fellowship, which we don't talk about.\nIt chooses to remain anonymous.\nBut I was meeting at Atlanta Diner right up the road with my AA sponsor.\nAnd we were working the 12 steps and I had several years of recovery and I'm in seminary but I was frustrated because I had a problem and I felt like it's either going to be this or it's going to be this and I don't like what am I going to do?\nI'm rocking a hard place, I don't like either of these choices and he said, Tom, you know you got what you call a suckers choice.\nI said, what's that?\nAnd he says, well, anytime that you think it's got to be A or it's got to be B and both\nand you don't like either one, that's a sucker's choice because both choices suck.\nForgive me for saying that in the chamber.\nHe said, anytime that you run up against a sucker's choice, he said, I believe that\nGod's will is almost always something other than I have already thought of.\nIt's usually not A or B. It's usually like P or L. Wisdom is saying, wait a second.\nMaybe it's not A or B. Wait. Let's ask God. Let's ask wisdom. Let's ask spirit.\nit. Let's listen for something speaking to the deeper things. Today, early in the\nsession, I pray that first day excitement would not fade into cynicism, that long\nexperience would never harden into indifference. Come on, right? Let's believe in\nsomething. May wisdom guide not just what you decide, but how you decide, how you\nspeak, how you listen, how you treat one another, because long after laws are passed, it's\nthe character of the people in this room that will be remembered as what kept things moving\nin a good and orderly direction. Amen? Would you pray with me? Oh yeah, we'll stand up.\nI got to do a funeral this week at Perry Methodist Church where I served and I was honored\nto get to meet again Senator Sam Nunn.\nWe were having the funeral for his former law partner,\nJim Geiger.\nAnd afterwards, someone said, people come up to me\nand say, wow, it was Sam's cousin, George.\nPeople come up to me and said, man,\nwe need more people like that.\nI'm so proud of him.\nHe stands on principle.\nand George said that he would reply.\nWell, that's great and all,\nbut you shouldn't stand out.\nThat shouldn't be remarkable\nthat a senator would be that way.\nShouldn't we all be that way?\nAmen?\nGracious God, give wisdom to each person in this chamber.\nWisdom equal to the weight of their responsibility.\nwisdom to seek justice, to practice restraint,\nto work together with humility and respect,\nguard their consciences, strengthen their character,\nand remind them that their decisions matter deeply\nto real people across this state.\nMay their service be guided by what is right\nand not merely by what is easy.\nAmen.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nSo he still gets 3, no 3.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nWhy is this numbers in here?\nMr. President, I rise to ask for unanimous consent to excuse a senator from the 26th.\nWithout objection, Senator from the 26th is its queues.\nThank you.\nYou\nYou\nIf I can have everyone's attention, please, we have a very, very special resolution that\nwe would like to present, and to any of you who may or may not appreciate your admin,\ny'all to be in here to show your appreciation, because we're about to recognize the best of\nthe best right here.\nSo, Secretary, read the resolution.\nSenate resolution 561 by Senators Brass of the Sixth and\nOthers, a resolution recognizing and\ncommending cartrelia Denise Samson on her outstanding service as a legislative assistant,\nserving many senators over the years with the Georgia Senate and now as a director of\nconstituent services with the office of the lieutenant governor and for other purposes.\nWhereas since 1996, Cartrelia Denise Samson,\nfondly known as Denise, by all those who know and love her,\nhas served in the Senate as a legislative assistant.\nWhereas since January 2023,\nshe has been the director of constituent services\nfor the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, and whereas,\nshe has diligently and conscientiously devoted\ninnumerable hours of her time,\ntalents and energy toward the betterment of her community and state\nas evidenced dramatically by her 30 years of superlative service\nas a legislative assistant.\nAnd, whereas Denise has served with honors and distinction\nwith the Georgia Senate and her vision\nand unyielding commitment to the state of Georgia\nhave set the standard for public service.\nAnd now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate\nthat the members of this body recognize\nand commend the cartrelia, Denise Samson,\nfor her her efficient, effective, unselfish,\nand dedicated public service to the state of Georgia\nand extend the most sincere best,\nwhich is for her continued health and happiness.\nMr. President, that completes the order.\nHis objection to the adoption of resolution chair here is done.\nThe resolution is adopted.\nBefore I introduce my old roommate, he also had the opportunity to have Denise as his\nadmin.\nI wanted to say a few words, Denise Samson has been by my side ever since I got elected\nback in 2013, which is now in our 14th year and I will tell you, she is the absolute\nbest. I knew she was good because when I first got here I had my sweet mate was a guy named Jason\nCarter and I knew Jason was going to have the best of the best and so when he left and ran for\ngovernor I told Denise I was like I want to keep I want you to stay with me and she said well they've\nall for been more money to go with the other party and I said I don't care what they offer I'll\nmatch it, you know, but at any rate, Denise is always in a great mood. Those of you who know her well\nknow that she's never had a bad day. She is a very good at what she's does. She's very\nprofessional at what she's does. And any time, any and every year, we always have that matter. The\nnew admins get hired or the interns that come and work for us for a season. They always find their\ntheir way to Denise's office because they feel they feel wanted, they feel loved, and\nthey feel appreciated, and she absolutely is the example that I give everyone of what\nwe need to strive through as far as administrative service individuals.\nSo I love her like family.\nI know Senator from the six feels the same way I do.\nAnd every senator who has had the opportunity to have her before we were fortunate to have\nher obviously feels that way too, 30 years is a long time in this body.\nShe doesn't look like she looks 30 now, but so it's amazing that she still looks as young\nas she does having been around having to deal with a bunch of senators all the time.\nBut she's a wonderful, wonderful lady, and I'm glad we could recognize her today, but\nAnd I'll recognize the actual person who brought the resolution senator from the six.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nIt does give me a great honor to honor our friend and I'll call her family member Denise\nSamson.\nAnd there's one part of the resolution I do want to highlight and it says Denise is significant\norganizational and leadership talents, remarkable patients,\nand diplomacy, keen sense of vision,\nand sensitivity to the needs of the citizens of this state.\nAnd I just finished up my freshman session.\nThis was back in 2017, and my admin was leaving.\nShe had actually gone, got a great job,\nand with a great company, and was leaving.\nAnd I say that to say she wasn't leaving\nbecause I served me for a year,\nbut at least that's what I tell myself.\nBut I got a call from our lieutenant governor\nwho was losing his suite mate over there at CLOB\nand he asked me to come join him.\nAnd I was a little hesitant at first\nbecause I was thinking, all right, here I've known this guy\nsince college, you know, I don't know if being up here being with a friend, we might get\nin a little trouble. This may not be a good idea, but then when I looked and I knew his\nadmin was the best of the best. And really Denise was the real reason that I joined\nno offense there, Mr. President, but she was the real reason that I wanted to be a part\nthat office and and I was right my instincts were right we did go on and and get in a little trouble\ntogether but but Denise stood by our side through thick and thin she always had we truly became a\nfamily in that office even got to play chess with her her grandson I think he beat me in less than a\nminute and a half and it would have been shorter had a not delayed some of my moves but she's just\nbeen a dear friend and just someone that really I look up to I know the the\nPresident of the Senate looks up to her as well because she's she just truly\ncares about people she cares about helping citizens of Georgia she cares about\nhelping us and I think about like Nick Sabin and his his coaching tree and you\nsee that you see the people that that were under his tutelage and they've gone\non to do great things, and you look at the interns that Denise has trained, and you look\nat her tree, and you look at where they are in this state, and there's just great people\ndoing great things that learned under such a great person in Denise.\nSo, without further ado, Denise, thank you so much for all you've done for us as individuals.\nyou for all you've done for the citizens of this great state over three decades of service.\nSo Denise, I know you're very short of words, but I'd love for you to address the Senate.\nall right thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you all so much thank\nThank you, Tina Gov. Oh, I was so young when I started here. Thank you all so, so very\nmuch for this recognition. I should not be nervous, but I am quite nervous, but this\nis my family. Lieutenant Gov.

We stayed in the office\nfor 10, four years in the office.\nSo thank you, Lieutenant Governor, for this great recognition.\nThank you for this amazing team that we have.\nI feel like I have team members, colleagues that are not just colleagues,\nbut they are real friends.\nAnd we have a great synergy together.\nBut I appreciate it so much.\nI feel like it is a blessing and it is an honor for me\nto call the Senate, my family.\nThis is my home.\nI guess that's why I stayed for 30 years.\nBut it's been a magnificent ride as it continues\nto be a magnificent ride.\nSo thank you all so very much.\nIt means a lot.\nThank you.\nThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.\njust to make it clear that wasn't a retirement speech because she I told her she's got four more years with me so just at least.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nIt is always nice to have our doctors of the day and recognize them for their hard work\nand their time that they volunteer for us.\nAnd once again, I'll recognize Senator from the 6th and introduce our doctor of the day.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nIt gives me great honor to introduce Dr. Tess Faye Talila.\nHe's a U.S.-based interventional cardiologist.\nHe's actually based right in Noon in Georgia at Piedmont, Noon in serving with my sister\nand my wife.\nHe comes from Ethiopia.\nHe was born and raised in humble circumstances on the outskirts of Ethiopia.\nDr. Talila developed an early commitment to service\nand a clear calling to medicine.\nGuided by this purpose, he pursued medical education\nat the University of Ethiopia graduating in 2008\nas class valedictorian.\nHe's been an assistant professor of medicine\nat Addis Adaba, Ababa University,\nbefore relocating to the United States in 2010\nto pursue advanced training in cardiology.\nOver 14 years of medical training,\nDr. T'Lila earned multiple honors,\nincluding best resident teacher of the year,\nand excellence in teaching award.\nDr. T'Lila holds board certifications\nin internal medicine, cardiovascular disease,\ninterventional cardiology, nuclear cardiology,\nand adult echocardiography.\nHe's committed to service beyond traditional practice.\nHe has volunteered for the past five years\nat the Healing Bridge Clinic in Georgia,\nproviding free cardiovascular care\nto uninsured and underserved populations.\nAnd despite his professional success\nin the United States, Dr. Tileva\nhas profoundly affected by the disparity\nin the cardiovascular outcomes\nbetween high and low resource settings\nAnd where led him and his wife to found the heart attack\nEthiopia, which is a, together they lead this mission\nto build sustainable and comprehensive\ncardiovascular care in Ethiopia, which\nI've had the pleasure of working with him a little bit\non helping get his supplies and people over to Ethiopia.\nTo date, these efforts have resulted in over 400 life-saving\ncardiac procedures, transforming access to care, and strengthening local capacity.\nHe's a devoted husband and father of four young children, and he balances family, clinical\nexcellence, and global service with a deep sense of purpose.\nWith that, I give our doctor of the day to you, Dr. Tallila.\nA great man.\nGood morning, Mr. President, members of the Senate.\nThank you for welcoming me today.\nIt's truly an honor to be invited, to be the doctor of the day for the 2026 Georgia legislative sessions.\nI stand before you today not only as a successful\ninterventional cardiologist in Georgia,\nwho has over hundreds of meaningful encounters\nwith patients when they have heart attacks,\nincluding one from this morning at 2 a.m.\nBut also someone who is deeply dedicated\nto improving access to cardiovascular services\nfor the people of Ethiopia and bigger Africa.\nWhat we do in medicine with service,\naccess and compassion has an impact\nthat transcends far beyond any local community\nor any country.\nI stand before you as someone who is born and raised\nin Ethiopia, in rural Ethiopia, with poor access to electricity and running water.\nAnd after I moved here, I successfully managed to train as an interventional cardiologist.\nAnd this dream was made possible because of the service that you provide.\nThank you so much on behalf of the people of Georgia, the physicians in Georgia, and\ncommunity that we support in Ethiopia. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your service\nand I wish you a productive legislative session.

Mr. President, that please be ordered.\nHere's the objection to the Senator's unanimous consent.\nHearing none.\nSenator, SB 106 will be removed from the state and local government and put in to state\nClaude Low-Government General.\nMr. President, I move that this Senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate Bill 204.\nSenators move that the Senate agree to house up so you don't Senate bill 204 secretary read the caption\nSenate bill 204 by Senator Jones of the 22nd\nSenator more of the 53rd\nA bill to be entitled an act to amend code section 1777 of the official code of Georgia annotated\nWe're laying to trial upon accusations in certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea of guilty or no low contenderay.\nAnd for other purposes.\nMr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate No 2.\nMr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 204.\nA bill to be entitled to amend Title 16 and 17 of official code of Georgia annotated.\nWe're laying to crimes and offenses and criminal procedure respectively.\nThanks to us to provide certain criminal provisions relating to the authorization of certain public officers and public entities to provide standards for bringing an action against the government for an unauthorized act relating to regulation of weapons to provide for definitions to allow for offenses that are not serious violent felonies sexual felonies or there's certain offenses and for other purposes and that please you are Mr. President.\nSenator from the 53rd, speak to the motion.\nPresentatives that there are a lot of deceivers over there.\nAnd they have deceived a great piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that this Senate passed out,\nSenate Bill 163, which was the most pro-gun piece of legislation that I've\nseen passed out since I've been a member of the Senate. And I'll remind you of\nthat piece of legislation. It makes all Georgians, regardless of whether you're\nfrom a rural area like my home county of Dave County or whether you're from\nDeCab County, you can travel the state freely knowing that you're not going to\nbe a victim of a crime and then be made a criminal as we've seen in Savannah,\nGeorgia. So what did the House do? They took a great piece of legislation from the Senate\nand they gutted it and then they gutted a Democrats bill and they put my legislation\nin with Senate Bill 204. But luckily the minority leader and I have agreed to switch over\nwho is the primary author so the Democrats don't have to take responsibility for this great\npiece of program legislation that is now Senate Bill 204.\nNow let me remind you again what this piece of legislation does.\nRight now there are 41 Georgians in Savannah who are victims of a crime who are now been\nmade criminals because some municipality like Savannah has passed gun legislation that\nIt is more stringent than what this General Assembly has already passed.\nYou see, we are the Supreme Law-Making Authority in this state, not some liberal municipality.\nWe already understand that we have preemptive powers as a legislature, and what this legislation\ndoes is it gives those preemptive powers to the citizenry.\nSo any citizen can sue a place like Savannah for violating their gun rights at a tune\nof $25,000 per occurrence.\nThat puts teeth into it and they don't have to depend on some bureaucracy like our attorney\ngeneral to take care of their rights.\nWe're putting freedom back into the hands of the citizenry.\nI ask for your favorable consideration on this legislation and it will be the most pro-gun\na piece of legislation that this Senate has passed since I've been here.\nThank you, Mr. President, I'll yield the well.\nSenator Hesild, Senator from 14th for Purpose E-Ryze, Parliamentary Agreement Mr. President,\nstage your inquiry.\nI don't know, this just seems like kind of an exhausting conversation.\nI know we have a lot of afternoon plans.\nIs there any reason that the chair is aware of why we couldn't do this tomorrow?\nSenator is very inquisitive and we appreciate all your feedback to your senator.\nBring it on, Senator, from the second.\nWell, thank you, Mr. President.\nI didn't intend to be in the well this early\nin this legislative session.\nBut I want to be clear about a couple of things.\nThe City of Savannah supports the Second Amendment.\nI support the Second Amendment as a gun order.\nI want to be clear about what the ordinance does\nwhat it does not do. This ordinance that the City of Savannah has passed regulates the car\nand not the gun, and this has reduced gun thefts of over 30% in one year in the City of Savannah\nalone. The City of Awhelmingly supports the Second Amendment, but they also believe that\npublic safety is at risk when guns are stolen from unlocked cars. And if someone is going to\ncarry their firearm with them and they're going to use it for protection, a gun in your car\ncannot protect you from someone breaking into your house and so if they're\nbreaking into your home and you got to then get out of your house to get to your\ncar to then get said firearm to protect yourself then you've already lost and\nso it is important that we understand the impact of this ordinance again it\nis not regulating the gun is not regulating the gun owner is regulating the\ncar saying that you cannot leave an unlock loaded firearm in a vehicle the\nsame way, you would not want a police officer to leave their police unit,\nunlock with firearms in the car.\nThe same way we would like gun orders to be responsible,\nto not leave them in their vehicles unlocked as well,\nso that they could fall into the wrong hands very easy.\nAnd you don't know when someone is going to become a criminal,\nnot until they become a criminal, until they cross that line.\nThere is no predetermination of who's going to do what.\nSo with that, I would ask for my colleagues to vote known this legislation.\nAnd let's take it about the right way and do it in the right way.\nWith that, Mr. President, I yield the well.\nSeniors yielded.\nDoes any of the Senator wish to speak for against the measure?\nChair, here's none.\nWe will now vote on the motion.\nAll those in favor of the Senator from the 53rd's motions will vote, yay, all opposed, nay.\nSecretary, on the machine.\nYou\nYou\nAll in the motion to agree to house substitute the a's are 32 the nays are 21 and\nThe motion prevails\nCenter for the 53rd for what purpose do you rise? Thank you, Mr. President\nI ask for unanimous consent to immediately transfer Senate bill 204 to the governor\nIs there objection?\nWhere we'll put it on the board. How about that? All those in favor of the motion without\nyay? All those opposed? Nay? And we'll wait on the Secretary to unlock the machine.\nYou\nAll in the motion to immediately transmit to the governor's office, Yezr-31, the\nNays are 21, and this motion prevails.\nFails, I'm sorry.\nAll right, what we got now.\nYeah, the majority leader.\nPregnize the majority leader.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nI move that the Senate stand adjourn until 10 30 a.m.\nWednesday, January 14th.\nSecretary, the announcements.\nThe ethics committee in room 307 at 2 p.m. is canceled.\nThank you, Mr. President, that will be the order.\nThe Majority Leader has moved that the Senate stand adjourned until Wednesday 10 30 a.m. January 14th.\nAll those in favor of the motion will signify by saying aye.\nAll those opposed, no.\nAbsolutely have it we're adjourned have a good day.\n",
