I'm hearing some people about mental justice. I'm here because of the fight\nwith the court. But I'm not here just to observe it. I've been on the Liberty County\nDevelopment Authority for 24 years and I've been chairman. I turned this chair to start\nin general. In this time, I've been involved in negotiations with all about\n100 companies that we've looked at for the time I've spent for how do you\nballoon what's your track record when is it you manufacture and what the science\nthey end up doing with Bob and the other side there needs a neat\nfamilies, they must be back, but I was in kind of both sides. They built the building\nand they burned it away. The balance was me. It all joined the jobs I desperately need.\nBut don't get through desperate until you take here in here. I unfortunately don't want to\nmany years. The day that is brought, remain in communities of color. And it brings to mind\nwhy you've worked for the crime and protection agency for many years. And watch the\nSuperfund be developed. And watch the largest Superfund area in the country. It's in\nand no children taught it, hurt to me for years and years\nabout the product of the baby.\nAnd unfortunately, I don't know why I didn't tell you.\nWe have houses occupied by citizens that there's no father\naway from me, to the staircase.\nThe interest there are to me, the needs will care to me.\nThere could be years and years and years.\nAnd there's a physical portion of the amount of cancer\nIn fact, community of color, it knows me.\nThere must never ever be a hurt to be incite in America.\nHi, nice to meet you.\nAnd when you manage to, you must have jobs and move to it.\nAnd there are a lot of companies out there\nthat should be bringing to the community\nAnd not sell your health for the sake of your job.\nYeah!\nI love you, I love you.\nI love you, I love you.\nI love you.\nYou've got to be conscious of what a thing can most do.\nEspecially those of you that are active,\nyou have to be sure that you'll be able to develop\na little more in the meetings.\nBecause if you're not in the table,\nyou're going to be on the menu.\nYeah!\nI love you.\nI love you.\nI love you, I love you.\nI love you.\nI love you.\nBut when you come and let your voices be heard, there is extremely important and the most important thing in the world is catch your back, right?\nIf you're going to raise heaven, have documented truth in your praise and heaven.\nDon't come and make a promise when you don't know why you're lost.\nMake sure that you leave the planet, that God created in seven days, that lasted for years.\nAnd in the last 100 years, man has done all the good to destroy the professor of God's life.\nOur mental justice is important.\nAnd you've got to stay in the fight. I'm so glad and excited to see my colleagues and this\nfeel that it's moving that we must get behind and perhaps take a bit to find what's\ngetting behind is important. But let's do it. Let's do all we can, while we can, and\nand please vote soon with this grand show,\nwith this great, great grand show.\nA legacy of the people.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nAll right, Zaya.\nPlease support House Bill 12's good afternoon.\nI'm sorry to start your speech about environmental justice.\nThey give it up to me to speak to them.\nI am the theory of faith and I can make it happen.\nTo speak about the need for the environmental justice and the state of truth.\nAs we do, I have witnessed the devastation of climate change,\npolicies, rules and mechanisms that allow environmental racism to permeate our neighborhoods.\nThe policies of police have allowed for graces to instra initiatives that would use our air\nand soil and water.\nMy thanks of the asthma.\nMany of my family members have lung disease.\nAnd many of them have never smoked.\nRural communities have covered poor, overburdened.\nDecades have been in their chemical plants.\nbio-mask ways, submit ways, recycle ways, and various international ways.\nEvery due to trends, serious conflicts, and harmful diesel useless,\nadverse impact of the code.\nOur medicines have the power to prevent any cancer out of it in Georgia.\nWe don't want to suffer as a people between maiden groups\nthat your needs are suffering with unprecedented rates of cancer or petrochemical\ncancer. I, who are our legislators, to establish, get bipartisan, me. We're together in a\nwell-being of those who continue to suffer because of the profit over me.\nAll right, Billard!\nWho are these people?\nI ask you,\nwhat is a world without environmental justice?\nWhat is a world without justice?\nPlease pass half the bill to the city\nwe are debating on the bank.\nI'm going to see it here for the Conservatives, the county, I come here for the deep south\nGeorgia.\nI'm going to see it there and I'm here because House Bill 263, the Governor of Justice\nBill is very important because I realize that we can get this regarding when it comes\nWe were talking in the comments that they did not have considered the number of rapids in our area, and that was a subtle amount of bases.\nAnd that's why we stand through the work in\nwith legacy of the national community,\ncities in our community that has movement and traces.\nThis only based on the common novelty of that,\nthere was a plant next door.\nSo now we have some protection\nwhere we live, where our children play\nfrom the human, from the human to the impact industries.\nThis is it.\nThe next door.\nWhy do we have to be even trying to earn money\nWhile in what I mean by that is what we see, our community members, our friends, and our loved ones disappear here and here, because they live near that land.\nThe one that was there since 1919, and we said, the one that left the grid so soaked into the soil and impacted the ground water, that land.\nWhen we hear those stories, if you look for the smokes that's in town and in any place in\nGeorgia, just on the west side, on the south side, that leads to the one where we have\nthe stench and air that people come to commonly to be in the custody too.\nAnd this is why today we act for House Code 263 of EPS, for annual Georgia, for leaving\nI'm not in about that, but from all of those town,\nso we may not see the face,\nbut we hear their cries and their concerns.\nWe want infants that build and have those that kill us.\nWe, there, are you talking about that?\nYeah!\nWhat about harmony and hurting humans?\nAnd we are sick and tired of being sick and tired,\nand we're also very weird here today,\nand we're asking you to consider us to see us\nto protect us, to see our children,\nand protect our nation by passing\nhow filled 12 to 163,\nthe environment for justice at the end,\nbecause clean and water is a human right.\nAbsolutely.\nYes, we will say that.\nWoo!\nWoo!\nWoo!\nWoo!\nWoo!\nHey, I'm 21.\nInside of this, I'm just going to\nI'm not sure what I'm trying to add, except I would tell you, I've been a striker for 17 years, and that one thing I know is that we're re-keener is when nobody else is re-keener, people call re-keener, we class, we study bomb lists in the county, we all listen, so we end up working in the middle of a quantum environment of justice issues just out of our base, and there is absolutely no doubt that I have that here,\nBut you can see, I'm all remember, that the all side of the state is lit up in wood.\nThat means that we have designated communities.\nWe also have state riverside.\nWe also have vocals.\nWe also have dns of chemical.\nWe also have solid chemicals.\nWe also have acupuncture plants too.\nYes, but they're located.\nThey certainly not located in places where people work in those companies.\nThey're located in a quarter of the units.\nand actually, you know what, we take that back,\nthey're not going to be for communities.\nThey're located in Black communities,\nbut then you take this advantage.\nThere's a few issues.\nThere's a few issues.\nThere's a few issues.\nWell, again, welcome to our first meeting.\nAnd yes, we're here at the same house.\nBut one, the feds are trying to pour money,\nas fast as they can into environmental justice communities.\nGeorgia needs to be in the forefront.\nWe need to be in the forefront.\nI'm working at that point in here to make a difference.\nThe other thing I'm going to argue is,\nwe're not telling the story.\nSo I'm in Augusta, we have a thing called\nHealthy Augusta.\nWe started because we have fought for years\nto keep people from companies from continuing\ntheir determination.\nA bunch of them left and then within six months\nthey dropped about four of them back again.\nIt's not the least it goes.\nSo we've worked out the emphasis, but that's enough.\nLike, we've got to tie environment in public health.\nThere is a time, there is absolutely a time,\nbut we don't recognize it.\nBut when somebody says environment,\nthat that means that there's a child\nwho's got a few points and just goes down\nand doesn't necessarily have a map.\nAnd yeah, so what I want to urge you today\nis to go back and tell the story that's not\nin the history books.\nGo back and figure out how you're new to music.\nWhat are the stories that have been told?\nWhere are the twenty-five men that died in ladder cage\nand have a cup of coke?\nRight?\nThose stories have to be told\nbecause you have to clean up what's there now\nand prepare the YouTube stuff.\nYou guys are incredible.\nHere, this is awesome.\nKeep it going.\nThank you.\nFor the 50 marks in the Latinos nationwide, live in regions around the world with severe droughts,\non-personnelting areas, and rising sea levels.\nLatinos will also make up the majority of the workforce into six impacted by climate change\nsuch as lack of culture, manufacturing and construction.\nor seeing the impact that we know that we do this so much more.\nNo social medicine will be gone.\nThat is why I'm standing together with nine of them.\nThere's nothing in the process that I'm doing to advocate our HD1263.\nA bill that would prioritize a fair enforcement of the environment\nfrom substance law.\nIt's your damage and transparency of the whole of the animal.\nCorporation that are destroying our land and our community.\nAnd most importantly,\nWe are here and we will continue to occupy this space, but we don't want it to be a moment.\nWe ask you to stand in line with us and ask each one to sit free\nfor the so-called maximum reward.\nAnd as all of us know,\nthose little students, how much they are very serious.\nThank you.\nIt's a young woman, Alabama, on an angle of high-tech work, I think we should take\nBecause we were standing on our shoulders, and we did a lot of work, we put in the work of the last piece of work we put in.\nwas a union, and that unity was by the American House, aimed at one of the places that\nand represented in the Alpeners, talked about him\naround his country.\nUnfortunately, it ain't yet perfectly.\nWith the most of the units in the room in the state\nof New York, most of us don't know their expertise.\nthat 27.5% of the superfund sites in the state of Illinois is in Glen County.\nMost people don't know that 17 recall sites,\nwhich is super fun sites meant by the state of Georgia.\nWe are here because the state of Georgia is not down.\nBut we haven't been introduced to the action that should come from the Bible.\nThe first amendment that God did to us is to take care of the creation of the creation of the Him,\nputting it place.\nBut what has happened to us is our preachers have lost their minds.\nAnd all that is interested in Him is the great change we can give Him\nto put free the trust of those of us, who work, give, have no resources to do it with,\nbut we have made it clear, as we did with that illusion that we did have her name.\nWe still have difficulties with our role from the church, that we don't wear much because\nour religion has turned a rage, it's turned a rage because people pretend that they're\nthey want to do something about the nasty earth, filthy, bad, war, sorry, dish, they pretend\nI might want to do something, but we didn't come down to the very idea of playing in the world.\nYou take time.\nOh, right!\nYou saw what we are.\nAnd we have great faith that we have been given those faiths to meet George along.\nWe have created that we were given enough space today to be within your action, who has come\non many a month against the dirty, nasty community we live in to shape up.\n12, 6, and 3 is holding the piece that a great value in your heart.\nIf you think that what's going to happen is the snake of Georgia,\nis going to branch the piece that you want to have.\nFrom heaven, clean water, clean air, and clean soil.\nEspecially, I am 85 years old and children.\nI have been working in this government for four years now.\nAnd I've seen for who could speak well, I've seen them.\nAnd they've come from all over the world.\nI know them from the places that we have called.\nCancer, Alec.\nBut they don't know from who Jordan is, Cancer Lane.\nWe got to get serious here.\nTake that call, please, we've got the spirit.\nWe have a good call, and he has a name.\nHe's working with us in a group of groups we call great force.\nAnd it is how to act in a group, how to defense,\nthe outcomes of defense and justice.\nWe do not know that our business will be destroyed\na next minute, right, without right here.\nWe couldn't get some that much of that here.\nWe know for the moment that we were all,\nwe know what we need for you.\nWe don't have resources, we can't hear all of them.\nI'll put those in your brain and let me talk to somebody\nwho ran without a thing.\nJust like the community is asleep right now, we are going back with Trent System 3 and\ntell the preacher, we are going to run you on the church, if you don't make us a lobby,\nwe have to be a lobby.\nThat's all I need to explain today.\nWe'll have to know for all of us.\nGot it, I'm just a big police.\nThat's why I don't speak in Georgia.\nAin't going to work that hard.\nWell, if you didn't get that for a call to ask, then I'm going to work with you, too.\nI would have first recognized my colleague, Y'all, but I'm going to get more of you to live here today.\nI'll say you're going to need to help you.\nAnd to my colleagues, to my friends, the play of play, the activists,\nto all that stands together to champion House Bill 1263.\nThank you.\nThe time has come and our time has come.\nBut Georgia, environmental justice has been first in\nhow it's been going for years now.\nIt is four years over here.\nThat's my friend who has said,\nthis is not just a human problem.\nThis is a simple one.\nThis meal is not just a meal.\nIt is a bill of hope for communities, it's a world bill, it's a suburban bill, it's an urban bill, we have the rights to have clean water, soil, air, we have the rights to have toxins for food, this is a emergency of public health prices.\nAnd we stand to hold those accountable.\nSo this bill is going to require stand agencies\nto consider the impacts of environmental happens\non not just people of color, but all on earth now.\nThis bill encounters all the rights\nand the wrongs of the past\nand ensures that every joy and every child going forward is healthy at home.\nAnd what really gets to me is that my colleagues refuse to want what's in the best interest of going home and going home.\nSo, this bill is young just about addressing the injustices, but it's about building a brighter\nor sustainable future for generations to come by bending, loosening prevention methods\nand community helps us.\nWe're safeguarding that help,\nand we'll be meeting our citizens,\nand laying on top of this,\nto prepare for our more prosperous New Year.\nSo let's not just standing together,\nwe're gonna take action together.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nWe're gonna come back in.\nNow, we get this done now.\nWe don't just need, we need not need\nfor this bill to be heard in committee.\nWe need to be voted out for the day of May\nto help explore. So we can quote, and this is your call to action, to make sure you're\ncalling the chair of the passport there in the head of our office.\nWe want to go to the office.\nWe will find way where we are. We will pay. We will simply require that this is the\nright thing to do in this year's season.\nWe went on the time six, three times,\nhalf a year.\nSo as Georgia thrives and survives,\nwe're gonna make sure we're at the table,\ndeclaring that this is going to be a healthy Georgia.\nThis will be in modern environments\nwhere we sound Georgia,\nwhere everybody has rights\nand we treat freedom with dignity,\nrespect, and we will be environmental stewards. Thank you for being here today. You have your\nwatching orders. Listen, you have the voice. We have a minute. When we come together, I'm glad to have\nI want you to get things done.\nI am saying, but we will go out and get it done.\nThat's true.\nThank you all so much, Jeremy.\nI really appreciate it.\nEveryone has come through.\nEverywhere in our store,\nmy voices are squished,\neven working so hard.\nLook at what we have here.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nWe will have all of that.\nThank you.\nThank you so much.\nWe want to go to the floor and we want to sit at the heck of a bill.\nThank you.\nHave a great day.\nThank you.\nThank you.\n",
