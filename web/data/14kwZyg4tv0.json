madam speaker\nladies and gentlemen the house arrives\ntoday to speak to you about senate bill\n10\nbut i first want to say something about\nmy good friend representative hogan made\nsome remarks about my\nmy uh my lighthouse and i just want to\nemphasize to him i don't know if he's in\nhere but i want him to know that i love\nhim like a great great great great\ngrandfather and uh i just want him to\nknow that in spite of his comments um\nladies and gentlemen i bring to you the\nsubstitute the senate bill uh 610.\nuh this measure um and i'm going to\nspeak to you about uh the two section\nthe two sections of this bill and i want\nto explain the first one very carefully\nthis bill very simply is going to\nrequire that every four years the\ndepartment of community health does a\nrate study\non uh home and community-based service\nwaivered programs so you all know and\nour chairman england would understand\nthis stuff so well we have entitlements\nto medicaid services in the world of\nlong-term care and then we have programs\nthat are waivered services that allow\npeople to be served in the community\nthose programs that you'll see before\nyou there's the now the new options\nwaiver there's the comprehensive waiver\nin this bill there's an independent care\nwaiver program the gap program which\nserves uh medically fragile pediatric\nchildren who would otherwise be in\nhospitals and then there's the\nthe edwp which is the elderly and\ndisabled waiver so all of these programs\nare waivered programs that serve\nindividuals who are disabled\nwho have long been part of the medicaid\npopulation that we serve\nand allows them to be serving the\ncommunity the challenge is is that we\nstruggle up here as we fund these\nprograms\nwe don't really have data to show us\nwhat the rates should be to serve those\nindividuals\nthis bill by representative sally\nharrell in the senate would require the\ndepartments to do rate studies so that\nthere's data to show us what the rate\nshould be it's important that i tell you\nthat the legislature is not compelled in\nany way to to\naccept those rates but at least the\ninformation will be there and i believe\nthis will be very helpful to some of our\nsubcommittees for making good decisions\nuh the section part the second part of\nthis bill if you'll look at lines 31-37\nis precisely the language in and house\nbill 1404 that we have already passed\nout of this chamber that bill passed 167\nto five that was representative pruitt's\nbill\nand what this bill very simply does this\npart of the bill\nis allow what are described here as\nprivate institutions for mental diseases\nare private psychiatric hospitals to\naccept medicaid\nso remember this is not medicaid\nexpansion\nindividuals we already have 78\n500 georgians with mental illness who\nwere on medicaid\nbut when they are served in private\nhospitals and i think most of you are\naware that our state hospitals have all\nclosed\nso we need resources to serve\nindividuals with mental illness in this\nstate this is a very good bill as a\ncompanion to house bill 1013 and it will\nallow those organizations to serve uh\nour constituents with mental illness and\nto be able to\nto bill for them madam speaker that's\nvery simply what this bill does and i'm\nglad to accept the question or two if\nthat's necessary uh there is a

post-secondary education\ninstitutions so as to remove provisions\nrelated agents and agents permits\nmr bill i refer to the committee on\nhigher education that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nby rules committee substitute\nchair recognizes chairman martin to\npresent the bill\nthank you ladies and gentlemen the house\ni bring senate bill 333 today\num this is a department of\ndepartment bill for the group that\noversees our post-secondary private\ninstitutions their goal of course is to\nmake sure\nthat the students are protected if they\ngo to an institution a for-profit\ninstitution that they have funds um\nto make sure that if something happens\nwith that institution the students are\nmade whole what the bill specifically\ndoes\nis it limits their oversight to schools\nthat are offering degrees previously the\nway the language went there was some\nambigu ambiguity\nin that they could also regulate people\nthat were uh helping with testing\nin order to get those degrees and that\nwas not their original mission it also\neliminates in sections three seven three\nthrough seven and nine through thirteen\nreferences to agents in years past these\nschools were sold to students through an\nagency arrangement with individuals\nthat's really just this that doesn't\nhappen in 2022\nso they are licensing the schools and\nthe schools themselves are responsible\nfor their agent\nit reduces the bonding capacity but\nincreases the opportunity of the agency\nto make students whole by creating a\nfund that's paid into by new schools\nand\nthat fund will be\nwhat i would refer to as a sinking fund\nso money will accumulate so if there's\nan untimely closure the students could\nbe made whole\nit\nallows them and by doing that it allows\nfor self-insurance it also this allows\nthe agency to be more responsive and get\nthe money to the students faster because\nif a bond has to be cash there's many\ntimes there's arguments with the\ninsurance company it takes a while to\nget the money in order to make the\nstudents whole so they can continue\ntheir education with that\nmadam speaker i would just ask the\nhouse's favorable consideration this\nagain is a department bill it takes us\nin a direction to\nensure the students in georgia that are\ngoing through these institutions\nor taken care of in the event of an\nuntimely closure the reason for the rule\nsubstitute was to better define\npost-secondary activity that only\nchanged from the higher ed committee\nthat was made in rules as lines 23\nthrough 30 to make that definition\nclearer there was a prepositional phrase\nthat could have applied\nto the post-secondary degrees and to the\nawarding of the study experience portion\nand we wanted to make clear that that\nwill only uh\napply to the second one you'll see that\non lines 25 through 30. with that if\nthere are technical questions i'll\nanswer them otherwise ask the house\nfavorable consideration senate bill 333\nthere's a question the chair recognizes\nleader\nbeverly for a question\na gentleman you yes sir\nthis is sort of a technical question um\nthe\nyou increase the limit from 500 000\ndollars a cap to is it going to go to\nabout 10 million\nuntil 2040. right and so\nthe reason for that\nincrease\nis it stepwise or is it up to\n20 40 it'll be 10 million dollars\nyeah thank you thanks gentlemen for the\nquestion well the reason for the\nincrease in the funds is because the the\nreduction of the bonding requirement\nbecause having the fund allows the\norganization access to the money in the\nevent of an untimely college so they can\nmake the students hole faster as opposed\nto arguing with the uh holder of the\nbond the insurance company that that is\nthe reason the increase the reason out\nto 2040 is so that they don't charge the\nschools so much as to increase the cost\nto the students\nbut if that answers the gentleman's\nquestion so you increase the fund to\nhave money to pay out the students in\nthe event of an untimely closure\nand um that would make them more the\nmoney more accessible than it would be\ncoming out about it's a self-insurance\nif you will\nthere are no more questions thank you\nisa house favorable consideration senate\nbill 333 and yield well the gentleman\nhas yielded the well is

myself\nmost people don't realize it and and\nbecause you don't see other family\nmembers i have three sisters they're all\nyounger than me\nand those of you that are older an older\nbrother and sister you know that you're\nalways right you know that\nyou don't pick on younger brothers and\nsisters\nthat was the way it was at my house\nand you can believe that if you want to\nthat younger brothers and sisters are\nmade for that\num\ni wanted to tell you a little something\nabout\nuh my family my\nmy father's name was thomas and my\nmother's name was matilda\nand\nmy daddy was from jackson county and my\nmother was from walker county\nand my mother's father was a cotton\nbuyer for crystal springs which is the\nmeal that mr tarvin owned at\nchickamauga\nmy father's parents were both teachers\nbut they weren't teacher both teaching\nafter after uh when before he was born\nbecause when they got married my\ngrandmother had to quit teaching because\nthey didn't allow married women to teach\nat that time\nthey were both my parents were college\ngraduates they went to\nthe university of georgia my my father\ndid he had a degree in agriculture my\nmother had a degree in home economics\nfrom maryville college and you wonder\nwell how did they get together they\nwould live so far apart well an opening\nfor a home demonstration agent opened up\nin jackson county and my mother got that\njob and they met and the rest is history\nthey instilled in us a work ethic that i\nthink\nstill prevails\nfor for me and my sisters today\nwe don't\ndon't sit around much we're always\nfinding something to do\nand\nthey also instilled a need for education\nit was never that\nif you go to college it's when you go to\ncollege\nand all of all of us ended up being\ncollege graduates\nthe neighborhood that we grew up in\nthere were 15 kids\nin the neighborhood but that was just\nthree families\nuh that was uh four and\nmy family\nfive and another six in another\nand uh all of those every one of us got\nthe chance to go to college now didn't\neverybody finish college but out of that\ngroup we ended up with four teachers and\nand two pharmacists and and two\nattorneys and two business two business\nmen so\num\nthe\npervasive idea in the neighborhood was\neducation\num\ni when i graduated from high school i\nwent to west georgia college it's called\nthe university of west georgia today\nwhen i started there it had\n2 500 students when i left there it had\nnearly 8 000\nbut it only took me four years to get\nfinished\ni then went to bernal college and got a\nmaster's\nin education\nit has been a tremendous honor for me to\nserve the last 18 years\ni'm still allowed when i come into this\nroom\nyou think of all the georgia movers and\nshakers that have been in this room\nand then you think about all of us\nthat help those movers and shakers get\nthings done\ni modeled with the building\nand how it came about\ni've been in a lot of state capitals\ni've done some traveling i've been a lot\nof state capitals but for its age i've\nnot seen any that i thought were any\nprettier\ni want to start off by thanking several\npeople the first is my wife karen\nshe has been a tremendous support from\nme these last 18 years\nshe's had to put up with a lot and be\nunderstanding of\nwhat i had to do in this job\nwe would be married 23 years in june\nwe met on a blind date and i know some\nof you are saying she must have been the\none that was blind\nand you\nand you're and you're right\nuh most husbands will agree\nto an old saying that they out kicked\ntheir punt coverage\nwe had a lot in common but some of those\nthings were\nneither one i was smoked or drank\nwe liked 50 60s and 70s music she's more\n50s and 60s and i'm more 60s and 70s\nshe's an amazing person worked at st\nmary's hospital for 46 years before\nretiring two years ago\nshe couldn't be here today but she's\nwatching online and i would i would\nappreciate a welcoming from y'all thank\nyou\n[Applause]\n[Applause]\num i want to thank my children i have\ntwo\num i actually i have four cause karen\nhad two when we got married\nand uh\ni i really want to throw a shout out to\nmy son thomas who looks after the farm\nwhen i'm up here it seems like that when\ni'm up here we have fences break down\ncows get out and uh i'm thankful that\nhe's there to\nput the fences back up\ni want to thank my administrative\nassistants and i've had some really good\nones\nsome were so good that they seem to be\nbeing poached by other representatives\nor departments\ni can think of two that i lost to\nappropriations just real quick\ni want to thank the house clerk and his\nstaff i've been privileged to know\nand work with two clerks\nthey were and are top-notch in their job\nperformance\ni want to thank the door keepers and the\npost office staff\nthe door keepers always meet you with a\nsmile and a handshake\nbut i gotta talk about the post office\ncorey is going to have to work on his\ntechnical skills and learn how to adjust\nthe thermostat to keep it warm in here\nfor us older people\ni want to thank the lobbyists\nfor the information that they have\nprovided over the years\ni can honestly say that i never got any\nwrong information from a lobbyist\nnow they might have had a different\npoint of view from another lobbyist but\nthey were giving me their perspective on\nit\ni want to thank the speaker and his\nstaff\ntop notch in every way\nin handling requests and problems\nbrought to them\ni want to thank all the members who have\nreally become my friends\nand me yours\nit will certainly be one of the most\nimportant parts of my tenure here\ni wish we had met sooner\ni want to thank my constituents that\nhave elected me for nine terms to be\ntheir representative\nfrom the 77 vote margin\nin 2004\nto the 80 percent in 2020\nand finally i want to thank my roommate\nwe had never met until our election\nvictories neither of us were predicted\nto win\ni beat the incumbent he beat the\nfavorite\nwe decided to room together because i\nrepresented a little bit of bear county\ni guess terry wanted to keep an eye on\nme make sure that i represented bear\ncounty correctly\nwe had a lot in common we both loved\nhistory didn't drink or smoke\none of the things that we agreed on\nfirst off was that we would not question\nthe others vote on an issue\nand we have not\ni can tell you there have been some\npretty hard stares across the chamber a\ncouple of times\nwe've had some pretty great\nconversations on history and books that\nwe've read in our and or our reading\nbut those conversations no matter what\nwe were talking about had to be finished\nby 7 30 p.m\ni could see it in his face and hear it\nin his voice that the spring was winding\ntighter\nand that in just a few moments he would\nbe launched toward his bedroom to go to\nbed\ni had i then had the apartment all to\nmyself\nwhen we came in as freshmen and along\nwith that the republican majority we\nwere told\ndon't think about a bill\nwatch and\nlearn we were told this several times\neven before we were sworn in in january\nof 2005.\ni'll come back to this in just a minute\nwe had a lot of free time since we were\nfreshmen no committees\nmeeting\ncouldn't even think about a bill so\nwe set about exploring atlanta\nwe would take turns driving to places\nwe've read about in history or been told\nabout\nwe even rode out to the federal\npenitentiary to see what was going on\nout there\nit's a dark foreboding place i don't\nknow why anybody would want to have to\ngo there\nwe didn't think we'd see anybody knew\nbut we we thought we'd take a look\naround\nwe'd both grown up with some pretty\nrough characters\nyou know bear county was famous for the\ndixie mafia\nand jackson county was famous for its\ncar stealing and bootlegging\nuh i think jackson county is the only\ncounty in the state of georgia that's\never had two of its citizens on the\nfbi's 10 most wanted list\ni want to mention a couple of narratives\nand they're as short as stories go\ni always say to introduce a little humor\nin\nmixed as it wakes people up i wish i'd\nhad this the other day\nuh they used to say at the beginning of\nthe tv show dragnet the names have been\nchanged to protect the innocent\nbut nothing's been changed in these\nstories except they had a little\nembellishment now and again\nthe first story\nbegins on a nice december morning 2004\nin athens at the biennial\nthree newly elected representatives are\nsitting at the table enjoying a nice\nbreakfast\nthe discussion was on a bill that we had\njust signed\na couple of days before and pre-filed\nremember what i said about the bills in\nyour freshman year\nthe three rookies sitting at the table\nwere you guessed it\nterry england tommy benton\nand our good friend tim bearden\nfrom\nfrom\nover there in west georgia\nfor the sake of the story\nthis was tim's idea\nand terry and tommy just went along with\nhim to help him out\nwell all of a sudden tim gets quiet and\nkind of has a pained expression on his\nface\nterry and i then realized that there was\nsomeone on the other side of tim that\nwas\nuh and it was the caucus chairman\nwho will remain nameless\nit looked like she was really chewing on\nthat ear\nand then when she got tired of that one\nshe came to the other side\nwell she was talking loud enough for\ntearing me to make it out make out what\nshe was talking about you guessed it\nthat bill\nafter she was gone tim said it didn't\nbother him none\nbut he we looked at his ears to make\nsure there was no damage or injury\nand guess what\nthat bill didn't even get a hearing\nthe second story is a little more\nserious\nbut it when you when you tell it it\nturns out to be kind of funny\nwe terry and i were on our way home from\natlanta after going to a fundraiser for\na colleague\nthe lady's name was jill chambers she\nwas a quiet unassuming lady\nyou had to be here to know her and uh\nwe often rode together to meetings\ntaking turns and driving\nit just so happened that it was terry's\nturn to drive that day when we were in\nhis white ford pickup\nthat i had dubbed the white bird\ni never referred to it by that name in\nhis presence i thought it might hurt his\nfeelings but the name fit because it\nflew\nearly on i decided that what terry\nwarner really wanted to be was either a\nfighter pilot or a nascar driver\nwell we were on i-85 in the hov lane\njust past shackleford road in the flow\nof traffic now floor traffic\nlate in the afternoon when all of a\nsudden all the people in the right hands\nright-hand side of the interstate\ndecided they wanted to ride an hov lane\ntoo\nthey all come piling over there in on us\ndrivers started looking at locking up on\ntheir brakes and we realized that we\nwere in\nthe big one\nwe had nowhere to go except straight\nsince the wall is to our left\nand it didn't take long for things to\nget ugly\ni seem to remember him saying hold on\nbut that really wasn't necessary\ni was already bracing myself and i\nalready grabbed the all-shoot bar on the\ndoor\nwe hit a car that had moved over into\nour lane it was a rav 4 but it was\nchanged very quickly into a rav 2 and a\nhalf\ni'm watching to my right and i see a car\ngo by backwards another sideways\neverybody trying to put their feet\nthrough the floorboard to try and stop\nand then it was over\nwhat it had\nwhat had happened in what looked like\nslow motion had lasted about 15 to 20\nseconds\nwell\nwe're pretty shaken up we i hadn't i'd\nnever been in a wreck that's serious\nbefore\nwe get out of the truck and start\nsurveying the damage and there was a lot\nto go around\nthere was glass all over the hood and we\nrealized it came from the rav4\nthe first emergency unit to get to us\nwas the hero unit\nthe driver gets out\nhe's a big man and starts to look around\ninto carnage\nthen a dekalb county officer gets there\nthe hero goes over to talk with the\nofficer about how he wants to work the\nwreck\neither to work it in the lanes or take\npictures and get the cars out of the way\nso traffic can start moving\nwell the officer said he would work on\nworking in the lanes at which point the\nhero tells him\nwrong answer\nthe officer needed to start taking\npictures because the hero is fixing to\nstart dragging cars\nboy did he drag cars\nthe howls of protests by the cars as\nthey were physically dragged across the\ninterstate to the emergency lane with\nsomething to hear\nnot only do we have to listen to that\nbut also the hecking from the\nrubberneckers shouting thanks for tying\nup traffic and giving us the peace sign\nwith just one finger\nwell terry goes back to his truck starts\nlooking at the damage to the white bird\nwhen the hero gets to the truck terry\nsuggests that the only thing wrong\nthat would keep him from driving is that\nthe wreck bent the bumper down\nenough to be on the tire\nand if the bumper were pried up then we\ncould drive home\nso the hero goes back to his truck and\ngets a pry bar and it's a big one\nhe comes back to the truck twirling it\nlike a baton\nwell he's\nputs the pry bar in between the bumper\nand the tire and he's putting all he's\ngot into bending the bumper out of the\nway and he bends the pry bar\nhe then looks at terry\nand says\nyou pretty good size fella\nand if we both try we might be able to\nbend it\nso terry gets a hold of the bar and he\nand the hero pull with all their might\nand the bumper bends just enough to come\noff the tire\nwe then find out that a witness saw\nwho'd caused the chain reaction\nso the white bird\nthe fix or repair daily ford\nwas the only one that flew home at at a\nmuch slower speed\nwhen i was elected in 2004 i never\nthought i would be here 18 years every\ntwo years kept rolling around and i kept\nthinking of reasons to run again\nit just happened\ni really got interested in the\nlegislature when i was teaching\ni brought my georgia history classes to\nthe capitol for 30 years\nwe always came during session\nfor several years i drove all the way to\nthe downtown but find parking places\nfor the bus was a pits\nso then we started riding the marta from\navondale to georgia state a lot less\nhassle\nstudents got to ride on the train for\nthe first time and a lot of them had\nnever been on an escalator\nour state representative was bubba\nmcdonald\nhe was also my boss as i worked for\nmcdonald hardware part-time on saturdays\nand during the summer\nmy first year teaching showed me that it\nwas going to be hard to make a living\nteaching school\ni was still working at the hardware\nstore when i was elected to the house\ni've known lauren over there all of his\nlife\nwe used to give him such a hard time at\nthe store\nwhen he was growing up\nred paint and flat handle scrub brushes\ncomes to mind right now\nbut if you ever need any gossip on him\nlet me know\nwhen i got here asked to be on three\ncommittees\ni was assigned four\ni'm still on those original three and\nsince then i've added three more\ni've so i've learned so much about state\ngovernment than i ever thought about\nteaching to middle school students\ni've also learned that a good many\npeople up here want you to be\npolitically correct and want you to say\nwhat they want to hear or approve of\nabout five years after i got here\nthere was a group of five of us\nalong with the\nuh\none person that we decided to support\nuh for speaker\nthose five were doug collins john\nmeadows terry england tommy benton and\ntim bearden\nand we were going to support david\nralston for speaker\nwe were not successful in that first\nvote and i all thought we would be\nbanished to the land of nod\nbut one year later we were successful\nwhen the speaker at that time resigned\nit was a three three-way race\nand david ralston was successful in the\nnext caucus vote\nwe were all proud for him then and now\ndoesn't mean that we always agree\nwhen i got here in 2005 i had a\nrepresentative who had been here for\nseveral years tell me that if you will\nvote like you're not coming back\nit will keep you in good standing with\nthe majority of your constituents in the\ndistrict\ni have tried really hard to heed that\nadvice\npeople want you to level with them even\nif it means telling them something they\ndon't want to hear\nstudents are that way too\nthey knew when teachers were just him\nhauling around on questions they'd ask\nin my first campaign\none in which we raised a little over\nthirteen thousand dollars\nwe were doing a lot of door knocking\nwhen this guy asked me why taxes were so\nmuch higher in jackson county than\ninguined or dekalb where he'd lived\npreviously\ni asked him if he wanted the pc answer\nthe real answer and he said the real\nreal answer\nand i gave it to him\ni told him it was because he and others\nlike him had bought these little postage\nstamp lots at high prices and had\ninfected all the land prices in the area\nthat in turn had caused housing prices\nrise but not enough to stem the tide of\nnew people coming to the county\nmy county right now is being invaded by\nwhenesians\nmore people mean more kids new schools\nare needed and the hits just keep on\ncoming\nafter i finished he looked at me and\nsaid\nyou've got a sign i can put in my yard\ni appreciate you leveling with me i\nfollowed that example during my career\njust level with people\ni passed some bills that i'm really\nproud of the historical bill that allows\ngovernments to place those documents in\ncourthouses and government buildings the\nten commandments the magna carta the\nmayflower compact the declaration of\nindependence are just a few of those\ndocuments\nanother one was the antifreeze bill\nit was to put a bitterness an antifreeze\nto make it taste bad instead of sweet\nnow i never tested to see if antifreeze\nreally tasted sweet but they said it did\nwe had i don't know whether any i\nremember about but we had a lady that\ndecided she wanted to poison her husband\nand then her boyfriend and then her\nsecond boyfriend\nand\ncalled her black widow\npoisoned him with antifreeze mixed in\nwith sweet tea\nthe idea was brought to me by a former\nstudent\nher dogs were poisoned with chicken\ndipped in antifreeze in her fenced in\nyard\ntook me four years to get that bill\npassed\nit would have passed it would pass the\nhouse and get caught up in the senate\nmy nemesis over there would not let it\nleave the rules committee because\ni would not vote for his school voucher\nbill\nimagine that\nbut it finally passed both houses and\nsigned by the governor\nseveral years later the local vet told\nme that since that bill had passed he\nhad not had a single antifreeze poison\nother bills dealt with land and home\nappraisers education bills retirement\nbills\nsome required some hard work in getting\nto know people both house and senate\nmembers\nsince coming here in 2005 no one can\ndoubt my appreciation for public\neducation\nand southern history and heritage\npublic education is where i made my\nliving for 30 years it was some\nsometimes a precarious living because\nteachers sours were not very good when i\nstarted teaching in 1974.\nteacher salaries did not really improve\nuntil zell miller became governor in a\nthree-year period our salaries were\nraised 25 percent never seen so much\nmoney\npublic education is where the make or\nbreak point for our

insurance policies to cover\nunexpected high claim levels in this\ncase the ymca had had high claims\nbecause lifeguards coaches fitness\ninstructors and other staff were\ntemporarily laid off at the same time\ntheir insurer denied coverage for all\ncoveted related claims this bill simply\nallows the ymca to pay the debt it owes\nto the unemployment insurance fund over\nthree years without penalties or\ninterest it won't cost the taxpayers\nor the fund a dime and it avoids large\ncuts to programs that georgia families\ndepend on that would result if the\nentire amount were required at

bill\nthank you mr speaker i bring before you\nsenate bill 183 it started out as a\nshare a qualifications bill for the\nsheriff's office and it's changed a\nlittle bit since then so i'll walk you\nthrough the bill the first part of the\nbill deals with the qualifications\nto hold the office of the sheriff\nwhat we want to do in this piece of\nlegislation is say that if you're going\nto qualify to run for sheriff you have\nto be in good standing with the post\ncouncil\ncurrently you do not have to be a post\ncertified officer to run for sheriff\nthis says that you have to do that to\nhold to seek that office\nthe next part of the\nthe bill\ndeals with\nthe compensation\nfor our sheriffs we passed out\nsenate bill 830 and added an additional\ncourt\nfor the sheriffs\ncurrently they receive additional\ncompensation for one court this adds two\ncourts\nto the sheriffs and then the final part\nof the bill\ndeals with some of the cleanup that we\nneed to do for our school speeding\ntraffic cameras\ni had a lot of dealers reach out to me\nover the last several months and car\ndealers are having to pay these unpaid\ncivil monetary penalties for folks who\nspeed\nin these school zones\nso when folks trade in cars or you trade\na car and that civil monetary penalty\nhasn't been taken care of before you can\nchange that title\nyou have to to pay that fine even though\nyou did not incur that so we're changing\nthat\nin this piece of legislation\nalso\nwe're changing\nthe permitting process for who applies\nfor the permit for those school\ncameras we're taking away the school\nsystem and having it be a more\naccountability on the local government\nso it would be the local governing body\nwhose law enforcement would be enforcing\nthose who would be applying for the\npermit and mr speaker that's the genesis\nof the bill and that's the bill and i'll\nstand for a question or two if anybody\nhas a question if not you do have some\nquestions okay do you yes sir\nchair recognizes the minority caucus\nwhip representative wilkerson to your\nleft for a question\nthank you mr speaker does the gentleman\nyield i sure do uh referencing lines 178\nthrough\n180\nyou're saying is transferring the\naccountability from the\nschool system to the county right\nhowever when we talk about our children\nis it not true that\nthe school systems are responsible for\nthem and that this is really a fight\nbetween the\nthe school board not wanting to give\nthat power to the county well i guess\nthat's a matter of perspective to my\ncolleague\ni see that as a way that uh you know if\nyou have people that are complaining\nand i've received a lot of comments and\ninput from my constituents and from my\ncolleagues here in the house about\nthese traffic cameras maybe being abused\nso right now in the permitting process\nyou have the school board who is asking\nfor the permit along with that local\ngovernment so we're taking one of those\nout of the equation so the buck's going\nto stop with the person that applied for\nthe permit that's in my opinion i think\nthis makes this a much better bill okay\ndoes the gentleman further heal yes sir\njust one more question so is it not true\nthat both cobb that i know of and\ndouglas are opposed to this bill so it's\nreal the school system so if we pass\nthis we would be taking that authority\nfrom the school board and giving it to\nthe municipalities who i guess are\ndesiring this ability to ticket and\nraise the revenue off of that well\nultimately the public safety falls back\nto to the sheriff of the police\ndepartment\nnot necessarily the school system so i\nthink this this puts everybody in the\nright lane in my opinion and that's why\ni included this in the language of this\nbill\nmr speaker i'll uh like to yield the\nwill and ask for your favorable\nconsideration to my colleagues on senate\nbill 183\ngentlemen has yielded the well is there\nany

greatly appreciate the fiscal\nstewardship as demonstrated by the chair\nof the appropriations committee and i've\nlearned a lot\nhowever i do want to bring the attention\nof the members of this body to lines 116\nto 121\nin which we have the 100 million dollar\nloan\nthat was that this body previously\npassed where a state audit in release in\ndecember\nsaid that this program in which we've\nalready loaned out a hundred million\ndollars does not come close to paying\nfor itself in which it's already\ncost the state 56 million dollars and\nthat it would take the state 72 years\nto pay back the 100 million dollar loan\nthat we've already given out and which\nthere is no requirement other than\nself-reporting\nwhich no bank in this country\nwould do\nand yet in lines 119 to 121\nwe are providing yet a second round\nof a hundred million dollars without\noversight\nso i i just want to bring attention uh\nto this provision that's in an otherwise\ngood bill which i appreciate\nbut i want to just make note that critic\ncritics have argued that this program is\nwasteful and efficient and lacks proper\noversight\nand that an expert in tax credit\ninvestments\nin reviewing the georgia audit release\nthis past december\nstated that this was a very expensive\nprogram that helps a lot of people from\nout of state to make money off of\ngeorgia taxpayers without creating\nlasting value in georgia\nso as stewards of taxpayer dollars\ni would respectfully urge the members in\nthis body to vote no\nparticularly in light of the provision\nthat's included here\nand i do hope that we could perhaps work\ntogether to ensure that there is a more\noversight\nregarding measures to\nboost and foster economic development\nthroughout this state but certainly in\nrural georgia thank you mr speaker i\nyield the wall\nall right is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered the\nchair here is none the previous question\nis ordered\nis there
