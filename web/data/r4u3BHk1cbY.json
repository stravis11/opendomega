And now\nto introduce our chief justice here and\nit gives me great pleasure to introduce\nhonorable Nell SD Peterson, Chief\nJustice Supreme Court of Georgia.\nJustice Peterson was appointed to the\nSupreme Court by Governor Nathan Deal in\n2016 and assumed office as the Chief\nJustice of the Supreme Court on April 1,\n2025. Prior to his time on the court, he\nserved in a variety of other roles in\nGeorgia state government, including as a\njudge on the Georgia Court of Appeals,\ngeneral counsel to the University System\nof Georgia, Georgia's first solicitor\ngeneral in the attorney general's\noffice, the executive counsel to the\ngovernor. Before entering the state\ngovernment, he practiced law in Atlanta\nand clerked for Chief Judge William H.\nPrior Jr.\nof United State Court of Appeals of the\n11th Circuit. He is a proud graduate of\nKennesal State University and Harvard\nLaw School. He serves on numerous\ngovernment nonprofit boards and\ncommittees and has received a variety of\nhonors and awards. He lives with his\nwife and two children in Cobb County.\nAnd it is my honor to present you today\nthe Justice of the Supreme Court, the\nHonorable Nails Peterson.\nLieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker\nBurns, President Prom Walker, Speaker\nProm Jones, members of the General\nAssembly,\nPresiding Justice Warren, and my fellow\njustices, Chief Judge Brown and my\nfriends on the Court of Appeals, other\njudges and fellow Georgians.\nEvery year, the governor reports on the\nstate of the state, and that report\nalways includes the announcement of\nsignificant policy proposals and budget\npriorities. The subjects of that speech\nare critical to your work as\nlegislators.\nThis speech is different. Unlike the\ngovernor, the courts have no formal role\nin the legislative process.\nSometimes chief justices use this as a\ntime to brag on the good work of Georgia\ncourts or talk about promising judicial\nbranch policy initiatives. And I'll do\nsome of that because there's a lot of\ngreat work to tell you about.\nBut today, I principally want to talk to\nyou about what the judicial system is\nfor and to remind us all of the role we\nmust each play to support and defend the\nrule of law.\nCentral to the rule of law is the idea\nthat no person is above the law's\nrequirements or beneath its protections.\nIt's the idea that law applies equally\nto everyone and the courts apply it\nimpartially and independently.\nAnd today I can proudly report that the\nstate of Georgia's judiciary is strong\nbecause Georgia's commitment to the rule\nof law is strong.\nThe state of our judiciary will remain\nstrong only so long as we remain\ncommitted to the rule of law. The rule\nof law has always required defending.\nAnd today is no exception. The judicial\noath calls Georgia judges to do equal\nrights for the poor and the rich. In\nother words, for the weak and the\npowerful. Of course, the rule of law is\nrarely tested when the powerful or the\npopular win in court. Results that go\nthe other way can sometimes be a\ndifferent matter.\nThe rule of law has always been fragile\nbecause by its very nature it requires\nthe strong and the rich to accept\nresults in favor of the weak and the\npoor. It requires popular majorities of\nall kinds to accept outcomes in favor of\nsmall unpopular minority groups. It\nrequires the most powerful of all, the\ngovernment, to accept and obey limits on\ngovernment power.\nThis rule of law that we enjoy as\nAmericans has rarely happened throughout\nhuman history. What we have had in this\ncountry for 250 years, as imperfect as\nit has been, especially here in the\nSouth, is so rare. And yet, we often\ntake it for granted. If we are to\ncontinue to enjoy the many blessings\nthat flow from the rule of law, we\ncannot continue taking it for granted.\nEach of us, all of us must do our part,\nwhatever that may be, to defend the rule\nof law. A critical part is this. When\nyou hear about judicial decisions whose\noutcomes you don't like, don't\nreflexively question the court's\nlegitimacy. It's okay to disagree, even\nto protest. But the rule of law will not\nsurvive when the legitimacy of judicial\ndecisions and those who make them is\nroutinely questioned every time there's\nan unpopular outcome.\nAnd here I should add a word on what the\nrule of law is not. The rule of law is\nnot rule by judges.\nThe law's constraints fall most strongly\non judges. If we push against those\nconstraints, we ourselves undermine the\nrule of law. We must not stray out of\nour limited scope of deciding the cases\nbefore us according to the text of the\nlaw that other people make.\nJudges talk about the rule of law all\nthe time, but it's also critical for the\nlegislature.\nNeither of our branches has the\nauthority or the ability to exercise\nforce. That function is reserved for the\nexecutive. Instead, the work product of\nboth of our branches is just our words.\nJudicial branch words come in a jury's\nverdict or in a written judicial\nopinion. We expect that these mere words\nwill control the outcome of criminal\nprosecutions, decide which parent gets\ncustody of their child, resolve matters\nwith millions of dollars at stake, and\neverything in between, one case at a\ntime.\nLegislative words work a little\ndifferently. One of you puts words on a\npage, and after a lot of work, the rest\nof you press red or green buttons. And\nwith enough green buttons, those words\nreshape Georgia law for everyone.\nThe words on the pages of both branches,\nalthough they operate differently, share\nthis in common. The rule of law is the\nonly thing that give any of our words\npower. Without the rule of law, you are\nall wasting your time and we judges and\nrobes are just playing a strange game of\ndress up.\nThis state capital is a building for\npolicymaking and sometimes even\npolitics. Policymaking and politics are\nteam sports. But judges don't play for a\nteam. We wear robes, not jerseys.\nExcept, I suppose, for the occasional\nSaturday in the fall.\nBut the rule of law depends on judges\nfollowing the law impartially and\nindependently.\nOne key opportunity you have this\nsession to strengthen healthy judicial\nindependence and impartiality\nis by passing house resolution 251\nsponsored by representative Kimberly\nnew. This constitutional amendment would\nend the partisan election of probate\njudges. Last year, you passed House Bill\n426, also sponsored by Representative\nNew and by Senator Rick Williams, which\nended the partisan election of\nmagistrate judges. And we thank you for\nthat. Taking this final step with HR21\nwill ensure that all elected Georgia\njudges are elected solely on a\nnonpartisan basis.\nJudges must be impartial and we must\nalso conduct ourselves in such a way as\nto be perceived as impartial.\nRequiring any of us to publicly and\nformally align ourselves with a\npolitical party can only undermine the\npublic's perception of the judiciary is\nimpartial.\nI am grateful to former governors Roy\nBarnes and Nathan Deal for recognizing\nthis truth and for jointly endorsing\nthis constitutional amendment.\nAnother important step that we are\ngrateful you took last year was\nreforming Georgia's judicial\ncompensation system. Representative Rob\nLeverett and Senator Bo Hatchet carried\nHouse Bills 85 and 86, which modernized\nan archaic and splintered system of\ncompensating Georgia's statewide and\nsuperior court judges. And Chairman Matt\nHatchet and Chairman Blake Tillery\noversaw the funding of this system\nconsistent with the new model. We are\ngrateful to you all and we look forward\nto this new model strengthening the\njudiciary over time.\nAnd what better way to transition from\njudicial compensation than to talk about\nhow hard your courts are working. And we\nare. Annually collected statewide trial\ncourt data is not without limitations,\nbut I'd like to highlight case filing\nincreases in a few specific circuits\naround the state. For example, in the\nSouth Georgia circuit between Albenny\nand the Florida border, case filings\nincreased nearly 44% between 2023 and\n2024.\nNe just next door in Dicab cases have\nincreased 17% during the same time\nperiod. And in the Chattahuchi Judicial\nCircuit, which includes Columbus,\nthey've gone up 14%.\nAnd we know that trial courts are\nworking hard across the state because\nappellet court case loads have gone up\nyear-over-year. The Supreme Court's\ndirect appeal case load has gone up 25%.\nThe Court of Appeals direct appeal case\nload in the same time period has gone up\n24%.\nBecause trial courts have to decide a\ncase before an appellet court ever sees\nit. Our appellet trend suggests that the\ntrial court's workload and output has\nbeen trending upward over time.\nNow, while deciding cases is the core\nfunction of the judiciary, there's only\nso much we can say about that. Judicial\nethics rules prohibit us from talking\nabout specific cases. So, our public\nfocus is often instead on judicial\npolicy initiatives. And I'm about to\nshift my focus to some of those. But I\nwant to preface that shift with the\nacknowledgement that our work deciding\ncases is the critical work that courts\ndo. And all the policy stuff is\nsignificant only to the extent that it\nenables and improves our work of\ndeciding cases.\nIn recent years, we have worked to\nimprove the quality and reliability of\ndata related to juvenile courts and\nfoster care, an area of great importance\nand interest to our branches. And I hope\nyou are seeing in the data that you\nreceive uh those results. Our court\nimprovement program in partnership with\nthe Department of Family and Children\nServices is piloting a new model\nintended to reduce the time from removal\nto reunification for Georgia children in\nfoster care. This joint project is\noperating in Cobb, Dicab, Fulton, and\nGwynette and we hope will provide\nlessons and opportunities for expansion.\nAdditionally, the juvenile courts in\nAthens, Clark, Gwynet, and Troop\ncounties are serving as pilot sites for\nGeorgia Thrive, Georgia's new infant\ntoddler court program. The product of\nthe work of many partners across the\nhealth care, child welfare, legal, and\npublic policy communities. This\nmulti-year initiative seeks to address\nthe unique needs and opportunities\nrelated to children from birth to age\nthree who find themselves in our\njuvenile courts through obviously no\nfault of their own.\nWe are grateful that legislators\nregularly lend their time to our branch\non on initiatives like this in the\ninterest of helping improve the\nadministration of justice.\nAnd with that service in mind, I want to\ntake this opportunity to publicly extend\nthe condolences of the judicial branch\non the passing of a remarkable woman who\ncommitted her time to serving on our\ncourt's committee on justice for\nchildren and was a tireless voice for\nyoung Georgians, Representative Mandy\nBallinger.\nHer\nlife of service has left a legacy that\nwill echo for generations.\nWe have recently concluded two important\nstudy committees in the judicial branch.\nThe first is the Judicial Council Ad Hoc\nCommittee on Artificial Intelligence in\nthe Courts, led by Justice Andrew\nPinson, Vice Chief Judge Elizabeth Goil,\nand Superior Court Judge Steve Kelly. As\nAI's power and reach continues to\nadvance rapidly, we all have to keep up,\nand AI poses both risk and opportunity\nfor the judicial system. On the risk\nside, the most publicized problems are\nlikely the least significant.\nYou may have heard stories about lawyers\nfiling briefs that are AI generated that\ncite non-existent cases because the AI\ntool invented them. That has happened\nhere in Georgia. It shouldn't and the\nlawyers that have have done it expose\nthemselves to serious discipline under\nexisting rules. But the risk that kind\nof misconduct poses the system is\nrelatively minimal as long as judges\nread the cases that are cited in their\nbriefs. The more significant risks that\nwe know about anyway are things like\nfabricated evidence. AI's capacity to\ngenerate false recordings or images\npresents a serious challenge to the\ncourt systems historic approach to\nauthenticating evidence. We don't yet\nhave answers to these problems, but we\ncontinue to work on them. AI may also\noffer opportunities. As a reminder, a\ncore part of the rule of law is that no\none is beneath the law's protections,\nbut in 2023,\nover 420,000\nGeorgia's civil cases involved at least\none party without a lawyer.\nThat's over one-third of the civil cases\nin Georgia's superior state probate and\nmagistrate courts. And while Georgia's\nconstitution guarantees the right to\nrepresent yourself in court, it's a safe\nbet that most of those 420,000\nunrepresented parties lacked a lawyer\nbecause they couldn't afford one. And in\nsome counties, even if you can afford a\nlawyer, there may not be one to hire.\n54 Georgia counties have 10 or fewer\nattorneys and eight counties, up from\nseven last year, have no lawyers at all.\nThe rule of law cannot be available only\nto those with access to lawyers. And as\nAI tools,\nI agree,\nand as AI tools improve, it may be that\nAI has a role to play in closing that\ngap. But we're not waiting for AI to\nsolve this problem for us. The second\nstudy committee that recently completed\nits work is the Supreme Court study\ncommittee on legal regulatory reform led\nby Justice Carlo Wong McMillan and\npresiding Judge Steve Dillard. It's easy\nto look at the problem of unrepresented\nlitigants and decide that the government\nshould just throw money at it. That is\nnot what this committee did.\nThe Georgia Constitution vests the\nexclusive authority for regulating the\npractice of law in the Supreme Court and\nwe do that through the state bar, an arm\nof the court. This committee studied our\nregulation of the practice of law to\ndetermine whether restrictions and\nlimitations\non that we have imposed on non-awyers\nassisting with legal issues might be\nmaking this problem worse.\nThe committee recommended that the court\nconsider a pilot project in which we\npermit trained non- lawyers to perform\ncertain limited legal tasks.\nOther states have been experimenting\nwith similar models and we have the\nopportunity to use what worked for them\nand to avoid what didn't. As we evaluate\nthis recommendation, I am hopeful that\nour creativity in lifting regulatory\nlimitations may be a useful tool in\nclosing the justice gap and ensuring\nthat no Georgian is beneath the law's\nprotections.\nAnd just as the rule of law requires\nthat all people enjoy the law's\nprotections, it also requires that we\nprotect judges from those who would do\nthem harm because of their rulings.\nThreats against judges have received\nnational attention the last several\nyears. Just a couple weeks ago, an\nIndiana judge and his wife were shot\nthrough their front door by a criminal\ndefendant with a pending case in front\nof him. And the US Marshall Service\nreports more than 560 threats against\nfederal judges during FY2025 alone.\nGeorgia, on the other hand, has never\nhad a process for tracking threats\nagainst Georgia judges comprehensively,\nthanks to the great work of the Judicial\nCouncil Standing Committee on Security,\nled by Justice Shan Ellen Lrua and\npresiding Judge Brian Rickman and\nsupported by strategic investments that\nyou have made. We are working toward\nsuch a process. And even with the\nexisting limitations, we have already\ntracked 35 threats against 30 justices\nand judges since late 2024,\nresulting in nine arrests.\nThis year, we will look to build on the\nprogress that we have already made. As I\nmentioned in greater detail several\nweeks ago to the joint appropriations\ncommittees, the Supreme Court and the\nCourt of Appeals budget requests seek a\nmodest increase for funding for a joint\neffort to enhance judicial security that\nif funded will pay dividends across the\nstate. I thank each of you for the\nsupport that you have given us in\nimproving judicial security and I ask\nthat you continue to make it a priority\ngiven all of these challenges. Why do\nGeorgia judges persist in the hard work\nof making the rule of law real for\nGeorgians? I think the answer is the\nsame answer for you members of the\ngeneral assembly. You too face threats\nto your security. You too face all sorts\nof challenges in your community through\nyour service.\nBoth judges and legislators face a lot\nof the same challenges. We are all in\nthis together.\nAnd we all face those challenges headon\nbecause we care about our communities.\nWe care about the people we serve. We\ncare about doing the right thing. And\nabove all, we are committed to\nfulfilling our oaths.\nYour oath is a bit different from our\noath because our roles are different.\nThe judicial oath promises independence\nand impartiality.\nIn contrast, the legislative oath\npromises the exercise of judgment in the\nservice of the interests and prosperity\nof the state. But despite these\ndifferences, both the legislative and\njudicial oaths are rooted in the promise\nto uphold the Constitution of the State\nof Georgia and the Constitution of the\nUnited States. When we take these oaths,\nwe make a promise to our communities. We\nmake a promise to those who elected us.\nWe make a promise to our families. And\nfor many of us, we also make a promise\nto God.\nThis aspect of the oath as a promise to\nGod has shaped the history of our legal\nsystem. In fact, in colonial England and\nfor most of our history as a state,\ncriminal defendants were prohibited from\ntestifying under oath, lest in their\ndesire for a quiddle, they brought upon\nthemselves divine judgment. Georgia was\nthe last state in the union to change\nthat rule. We didn't change it until\n1962.\nIn the Catholic tradition, St. Thomas\nMoore is the patron saint of lawyers.\nBut he wasn't just a lawyer. He also\nserved as speaker of the House of\nCommons\nand then Lord Chancellor of England\nunder Henry VIII. He's a great example\nof both judges and legislators to\nemulate. He ultimately gave his life to\navoid breaking his oath. His commitment\nto keep that promise to God is reflected\nno matter the cost is reflected in his\nlast words which characterized himself\nas the king's good servant and God's\nfirst. That's pretty good. But of\ncourse, as we like to remind our British\nfriends every July 4th and especially\nduring this 250th anniversary of\nAmerican independence here in the United\nStates, we don't have a king. as the\nconstitution makes clear here, the\npeople are sovereign.\nAnd so as\nAnd so as you return to your legislative\nbusiness and we return to our judicial\nbusiness, let us all commit to keep our\noses to the Constitution and the rule of\nlaw it embodies. If we do, we will truly\nbe the people's good servants as we seek\nto be God's first. Thank you. May God\nbless each of you, our great state of\nGeorgia, and the United States of\nAmerica.\nThank you, Jess Peterson.\nThoroughly enjoyed that. We greatly\nappreciate that and we greatly\nappreciate all the judiciary members\nhere. Uh and thank you all for your\nservice and dedication to the state of\nGeorgia.\nMr. Mr. Doorkeeper,\nplease escort the Chief Justice of the\nJustice Supreme Court and the judges of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Chamber at\nthis time.",
