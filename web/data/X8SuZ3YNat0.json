President thank you so much\nfor the invitation to join you today and\njoin this uh August body uh it is a\npleasure to be our Lantern it's a\npleasure to be a Georgian it's a\npleasure to be able to stand here in\nthis season in this time to say just a\nfew words of encouragement and hopefully\nChallenge and inspiration as well\nuh in the Book of Joshua\num about the third chapter the people of\nIsrael are prepared to go over uh the\nJordan River God gave Joshua some\ninstructions as regards to what was to\nbe done as they crossed over there was\nno Bridge there there was no bridge to\ntake them over so there was a challenge\nbecause at the season they were going\nover there was a great amount of water\nflow for the joy and it was a harvest\nseason as a result it wouldn't be easy\nto cross over the Jordan River but God\npromised uh Joshua that he would back up\nthe Jordan River so the people could\nwalk over into the promised land on dry\nland and so even as they crossed the\ninstruction was given that as the priest\ncame to the very edge of the Jordan they\ndidn't have to step in they stepped to\nthe very edge of the Jordan River that\nthe river was stopped and the flow\nstopped and the flow stops long enough\nfor the entire nation of Israel to cross\nover on dry land well the specific\ninstruction that God gave Joshua was\nthat that when the crossing was over\nwhen they crossed successfully over\nuntil the land that God had promised to\ngive them that they would take one stone\neach leader of each tribe would take one\nstone each priest would take one stone\nand from it they would build a monument\na memorial to what had taken place that\nday the memorial was to remind the\nfuture generations of what God had done\nfor them it was to remind the future\ngenerations of what God had done through\nthem and to remind future generations of\nwhat God was capable of doing and so\ncertainly after they had crossed over\nsuccess with the Jordan River the 12\nStones were taken and stacked up uh and\nas Joshua said they'll be able to be to\nbe a memorial forever and as I began to\nthink about this years ago I began to\nthink that anytime a legislative body\nmeets there are stones that are being\nleft as a memorial of what God has done\nthrough that body whether it's the city\ncouncil the County Commission School\nBoard uh the house uh and the Senate\nthat each vote each thing that's laid\ndown as a vote each vote that is cast\neach piece of legislation is a reminder\nof what God has done and what God will\ndo as his people are operating obedience\nto him and so I just want to challenge\nyou all today to continue uh to see God\nin in your in guidance as you do this\ngreat work that you're doing to\ntransform this state uh to strengthen\nthe lives of those who live in this\nstate but do it in remembrance that God\nhas given us this work to do you know\nthe future Generations will look back\nand see what was done through you all\nand so that's my Challenge and my charge\ntoday and I'm grateful for the work\nthat's been done up to this 38th day of\nthis session and I pray that God will\ncontinue to do that great work in your\nmidst let us pray\nMost Holy in our wives God our Father we\ncome this day first of all acknowledging\nthis is the day that you have made and\nwe are rejoicing even in this day and we\nare

even\nin Caitlyn's absence\n[Applause]\nteam you are phenomenal individuals and\nyou are quite a phenomenal Collective\nteam and it's a pleasure to work with\nyou in the past four years that I've had\nthe opportunity to do so I also want to\nthank our friends at OPB the months that\nthey put into making this bill happen\nbefore we even got here director Farr\nand his team of staff I have listened to\nour concerns over the past half a decade\nand a lot of the changes that you've\nseen Incorporated over the past three\nyears are changes that that he hurt us\non and through time was able to work in\nto the governor's budget from the\nbeginning\nalso chairman Hatchet his first year has\nbeen phenomenal his compassion his\nopenness ideas for mothers he listens so\nmuch better than I do y'all know that\ny'all probably go to him instead of me\num but he is he is a force in the house\nalready\nand I know that our budget will continue\nto improve with him at the guidance from\nthe helm from the house\nand appreciate speaker Jones at the time\nand speaker Burns for keeping him there\nthe FY 24 budget proposal before you now\nis a 34 2.4 billion dollar budget\nit supports law enforcement as I said in\ncommittee it protects our family\nsupports our children and quite\nliterally as many of you wrote and asked\ngives them hope\nin the big picture that I said already I\nknow it's fair to say that the Senate's\nversion more fairly reflects the\ngovernor's budget than than our comrades\ncost the hall our Compadres across the\nhall\ncomrades probably not the best word to\nuse was it there boys\nthe Senate's budget in Big Picture\nreplaces funding that the house pulled\nfrom Medicaid it also replaces the\nreinsurance program that was reduced by\nthe house and adds to it\nit returns hope funding to 100 percent\nfor students with a B average that was\nthe second most requested item by the\nmembers of this body\nand it supports the governor's two\nthousand dollar raise for all state\nemployees\nmoving into tidal areas we'll talk about\nhealth and Medicaid you know we restored\nthe cuts that were endured across the\nhall to ABD\nwe also were able to True up some costs\ndue to f-map changes through ABD limb\nand impeach care\nour budget also allows for the\nreimbursement of Oats occupational\ntherapy assistance and physical therapy\nassistance and provides allows them for\nMedicaid members receiving children's\nInterventional Services which also\nprovides parity with our neighboring\nstates\nthere's a show up in this budget before\nyou have about\na billion dollars to the state health\nbenefit plan we talked about that a\nwhole lot in the amended budget but you\nsee it reflected here\nand in DHS we worked with DCH DHS and\nthe office of health strategies to begin\na plan to address a structural deficit\nin our child caring institutions about\n60 million dollars and that allows for\nthose institutions to transition over to\na new federal model which will allow\nthem to be eligible for federal 4E funds\nin the future\nat the Department of Public Health we\nmatch the house and actually doubled the\nfunding for the babies can't wait\nprogram it's an early intervention\nprogram that supports infants and\ntoddlers with special needs\nand back over at DHS we added five\nmillion dollars to support the ending of\nhoteling\ngo a little off script here for a second\nwhen I spoke the other night I told you\nthat there were\num at the time I believe 13 or 14\nchildren who were sitting in ERS across\nour state waiting for our State\nContractor to move them out to permanent\nmedical placements where they could get\nthe care and services they need we know\nthat ERS is not the place\nthat serves them best\nalso doesn't serve our budget best\nas of right now or as of last night 68\nchildren\nwere in hoteling situations across our\nstate\nthat is 68 too many and we will continue\nto hammer this point until it's 68 less\nwe also had 17 children as of right now\nwho are bouncing either between an ER\na crisis stabilization unit\nor residential psychiatric treatment\nfacility\nwe spend 178 million dollars a year\nincluding federal funds on this contract\nand I do not understand\nwhy that 178 million dollar total\ncontract\ncannot end this issue\nback on script\nthe Senate's budget also provides 18\nmillion dollars to provide time to allow\nchild carrying institutions to\ntransition over to the qualified\nResidential Treatment programs I\nmentioned to you before\nand it adds over 40 million dollars over\nthe governor's budget to address mental\nhealth Staffing and facility needs at\nthe Department of Behavioral Health\nwe held the line with the increases that\nthe house proposed for our home and\ncommunity-based providers\nand the line item\nthat we were requested to add the most\nby the senate members in this budget\nwas that the Senate's version of House\nBill 19 will fund 500 now comp waivers\nand the credit for this again goes to\nthe senators from the 40th and the\nsenator from the 56 who championed this\ncause in a bipartisan fashion and had\nnumerous numerous members of this body\nsign on in support of their letters and\nI appreciate their their approach and\ntheir support\nin our budget categories concerning\neducation I think it's fair to say that\nwe address three things literacy\ndyslexia and QBE\nfor the second year in a row there's no\nausterity reductions of the QBE formula\nand we did fund the two thousand dollar\nteacher increase\nthis budget also made significant\nprogress towards screening all students\nfrom kindergarten through third grade\nfor dyslexia by including nearly five\nmillion dollars for the cost of\nscreening in addition to other state\nfunding for dyslexia coordinators and a\ndyslexia endorsement for teachers which\nis already in the base budget at 1.63\nmillion dollars\nwe passed that bill several years ago\nSenate Bill 48 it was set to come online\nin FY 2025\nand this budget actually brings that\ndyslexia screening online one year early\nfunds it one year early and thank you\nfor the support from the members of the\nsubcommittee and the other members of\nthis body on that endeavor\nwe also were able to take Senate Bill\n211 championed by the senator from the\nfourth and you've heard his comments on\nliteracy in this chamber many many times\nover the past two years\nand we took and made it more than just a\ncouncil and a commission we were able to\nstand it up by moving roughly one\nmillion dollars behind it to support its\ninitiatives to help with early reading\nto address our third grade reading\nlevels which you've heard the senator\nfrom the fourth talk about\nlie below 50 percent for on grade level\nat higher education the Senate's budget\nreturns to the governor's position by\nfunding 100 Factor rate for prior\ntuition for the Hope grants and the Hope\nscholarships at Public Schools\nit also adds another nickel to move the\npublic library materials grants to 70\ncents per capita for a total of 7.7\nmillion dollars\nand it provides additional funds for\ntcsg to recognize the high cost of\ndelivering CDL and nursing courses which\nare also both high in demand last year\nwe were able to fund the aviation\nportion of this this year we were able\nto come back on nursing and CDL programs\nthe Senate's budget also supports\nconservative budgeting by requesting\nthat our Board of Regents utilize carry\nforward funds to support the teaching\nformula and conserve valuable State\ndollars at a time that I've told you\nwere the clouds on the horizon are begin\nto look a little darker\nwe expect continued discussion with the\ngovernor's office and with the house\nconsider concerning building funds bond\nfunds\nin a robust discussion I'm sure we'll\ninclude will continue concerning how we\nfund planning dollars building dollars\nand ffne that follows after the\nbuildings are built\nin the area of Public Safety Arts the\nsentence proposal supports technological\nand data management upgrades at our\ncourts it also supports a six thousand\ndollar increase for state troopers\nCapitol Police DNR Rangers and the gbi\nthe way we funded this was actually by\nreducing funds for the trooper School\nTrooper schools are typically funded\neach year for about 11 million dollars\nwe cut that in half use those excess\nfunds to move to those State Police who\nhave had\nas you know increased duties over the\npast two years\nour thought was there is a learning\ncurve as people exit Trooper school and\nthese other training schools and if we\ncan if we can hang on and keep our our\nalready trained\nstaff that that's actually a cost\nsavings long term and better Services\nprovided for our citizens\nwe funded the Cold Case unit the gbi and\nthe senator from the 26th would not let\nme get out of this Podium without\ntelling you that we funded bonds to\nimprove the gbi crime lab in Macon as\nwell as various scientist positions that\nthat gbi crime lab to answer the call of\nthose below I-20 for why they're having\nto travel so far for certain services\nand wait for death certificates and\nother things the center from the 26 has\nbeen a champion on this issue the\ndepartment has heard him we have heard\nhim and we are really really thankful\nfor our director register and the\nanswers that he's already bringing to\nthe table thanks to the senator from the\n26th\n[Applause]\nour state budget funded other things as\nwell I want to run through them really\nquickly the Statewide Independent Living\nCouncil had a wait list of about 700\npeople by moving funds in other areas of\nthe budget we were able to wipe out that\nwait list we're also able to start a\nprogram that improves natural gas access\nin rural communities acknowledging the\nsuccess that the governor's office and\nthe members of this body have had with\nBroadband for years we were told\nBroadband Broadband Broadband we had to\ndeliver Broadband everywhere well guys\nyou've almost done it\nbut now we see that when one mountain is\ncrossed\nthere lies Another Mountain ahead and I\nthink the next Mountain ahead of us from\na utility standpoint is going to prove\nto be natural gas so the Senate's put\ndown its marker to begin a program to\nhelp it span capacity in rural areas and\nwe look forward to working with our\npartners in the governor's office and\nacross the hall to see where we can end\non that in conference\nthe Senate's budget also supports our\ngrowing EV industry by transitioning\ncertain unfilled positions at certain\nRegional projects to other Regional\nprojects in Southeast Georgia\nand it also funds the AG Department's\nrequests for increased funds to enforce\nsole Amendment rules across our states\nthe Senate budget has already told you\nfunds the coal increase for game wardens\nat six thousand dollars and it funds\nsupport in ag for positions in blueberry\nCitrus and the peach industry\nthe Senate budget also makes a continued\ncommitment to reduce State liabilities\nby committing five million dollars to\nreduce the state workers compensation\nliabilities we were able to do that a\nfew years ago at a six-figure number we\nwere able to drive that number down and\nsave years in in outstanding liabilities\nthe five million dollars again is just a\nmarker to continue that program after\nthe extreme success of our folks at doas\nunder director Sullivan and Wade Dameron\nthe Senate budget also agrees with the\nhouse to provide a one-time benefit\nadjustment of 26.75 million in total or\nroughly 500 individual for All State\neligible retireees and it also\nrecognizes that ERS colas are now being\npre-funded through employer\ncontributions as we move forward\nthe Senate budget increases funds for\nthe Georgia Food Bank program and it\nrecognizes 11 million dollars in transit\nprojects outside of Atlanta with a novel\nidea championed by commissioner McMurray\nto basically make sure we're not\ndoubling back over our own certain rides\nand helping citizens get to the services\nand appointments that they need to\nthe Senate also funded various bonds I\nsee you've already turned there most of\nyou have in USG projects we're going to\nhave a longer discussion about planning\ndollars I look forward to having that\nwith you and others and our colleagues\nin the house\nbut it does provide roughly 600 million\ndollars in bonding capacity for the\nfuture years\nI've already told you that you know we\ndon't get to create dollars so where do\nwe get those funds well that that's\npart of your budget as well we didn't\nagree with some of the house ads there\nwere fmap changes that I mentioned\nearlier that our staff was able to\ndevelop and by the Senate going last we\nget the best the last crack at seeing\nwhat the fmap changes are going to be\nwe were able to True up the dollars a\ncertain unhired positions and unfilled\npositions and then there was as I\nmentioned already conservative budgeting\nuh aimed and targeted at our largest\nagencies with directions to use other\nfunds whether those be carry forward\nfunds or agency surpluses\nor other retained Revenue\nwe held the house reduction at airport\nAid and we provided the same percentage\nreduction at rail Aid\nwe pulled funds committed to the\ncriminal data Exchange program and we're\ngoing to move those to the new program I\nthink the senator from the 18th has a\nbill on that that we expect to see\nshortly or we've seen in this chamber\nwe'll see from the house shortly\nwe also reduced certain funds at other\nprogram expenditure areas like the\nGeorgia coordinating Center the Georgia\ncyber Center and the Georgia public\ntelevision\nwe reduced our testing budget and some\npeople have asked why did we do that\nwell this body for years has maintained\nits commitment to reduce the testing\nrequirement on our students and on our\nteachers in the classroom\nand if we're going to reduce that\ntesting requirement we believe the\nbudget should follow that reduction in\ntests and this budget reflects that\nI've heard a lot of reports about\nheadlines lately I actually brought the\npaper to read this one doesn't get\ndelivered to my district so I have to\npick it up when I'm here\nand I saw lines that say we're in a\nbudget fight\nthat this building's about to burn down\nthey don't know if we'll make it the\nsunny day well guys I want to tell you\nfor the past 200 years we've made it to\nSani die\nand there's been no problem\nand the rhetoric in the Halls isn't\nalways the truth\nyou see I asked our staff today\nwith me to count up the lines of this\nbudget\nthere are fourteen hundred and twelve\nlines\nin HB 19.\nof those lines\n743.\n52.6 percent\nhave already been agreed upon by the\nhouse\nthe Senate\nand the governor\n52.6 percent\nif you've taken look at just\nwhere two of the bodies agree just the\nhouse and the Senate\n1176 lines where we already agree that's\n83.29 percent\nyou see folks in this building will try\nto stir you up sometimes and get you\nworried\nI want to remind you they're getting you\nworried about 236 lines\n236 lines out of 1412.\nmembers of this body\nwhat you've done over the past 38 days\nis incredible\nyou focused on your districts you\nfocused on your constituents you focused\non your families and what you want for\nyour future\nand I don't think we're going to have a\nproblem with the building burning down\nor us making it to day 40.\nso Mr President\nwith that thank you again for allowing\nme to present this bill on behalf of the\nSenate I'll take any questions and if\nthere are no questions I'll yield the\nwill\nand you and your team have done a great\njob Senator you do have a few questions\nuh senator from the 14th\nthank you Mr President Senator Senator\nyield yes sir uh thank you Senator and\nuh just to go ahead and begin by echoing\nthe great respect and appreciation uh\nthat I know many of my colleagues have\nfor your role and the role of the staff\nand putting together uh such a\ncomprehensive document working hard on\nthis\num I want to raise an issue I think it's\nbeen covered a little bit by media\nalready which is a 25 cut to Georgia\npublic broadcasting obviously on its\nface there are many members of public\nwho have a concern about something like\nthat I mean the importance of public\neducation via TV and radio can't be\nunderstated and so I just want to at\nleast raise that question for you Mr\nchairman today to see if you could\naddress the record on why the Senate\nversion of budget includes that cut well\nthank you Senator yeah happy to do so\nit's actually 26 but that's uh thank you\nfor that number uh it takes the funding\nlevel from 14 million to roughly 10\nmillion I believe if the reason behind\nit if they look if folks have questions\nin the media about it they can look back\nat the FY 21 budget they'll say this is\nnot the first time this has been\naddressed over the years other stations\nwho are I guess would be viewed as\ncompetitors in the same space as GPB\nhave brought a very valid argument to\nour body and they've said hey why are\nyou funding one and not the other let's\nbe honest what they're really saying is\nwhy are you funding my competition\nbut I think that's actually a very valid\npoint well why are we picking winners\nand losers I don't think that's what the\nspace we want to be in\nso the dollar value it was reduced I\nbelieve in the FY 21 budget one time\nalready we were able to come back and\nwork things out there's not a hatred of\nGPB in this building if you look back at\nour amended budget there's a six hundred\nthousand dollar ad for lighting for\ntheir Studios I think you'll also see in\nthis budget there's a bond ad for radio\ntowers and other equipment necessary I\nthink the GPB education budget if you\nlook at our audits that were performed I\nbelieve less than FY uh be FY 20 because\nit was 2019-2020 chairman Hill argued or\na push for that audit last or the\neducation program was a hit and it\nscored off the charts where the content\nthat was being able to provide and I\nknow it was multiplied during the\npandemic so that we would love for the\ncontinued focus on educational\nprogramming I think they have maybe some\nof the competitors have struck a chord\nwith members of this body and others who\nbrought up the fact that why are we\npicking winners and losers and we don't\nwe don't want to be in that market and\nright now that argument is winning\nwinning the day at least in this body\nyeah\nthank you Senator I will just correct\nrecord I think I said understatement I\nmeant to say overstated earlier but\nthat's the only thing I'll say uh thanks\nfor your response yes sir\nrecognize the senator from the first for\na question\nthank you Mr President as Senator yield\nyes sir well thank you uh Mr chairman\nthat certainly is a\nfabulous budget a lot of work has been\ndone you know I noticed that uh you know\nthe Senate fully funded 100 of Hope\nScholarship uh but to me the real\ndiscussion is that the section of the\nbudget of DCH or Medicaid that the house\nhad reduced it by about 100 million\nand the Senate\nreverse that\nand asked the Board of Regents to carry\nforward the funds uh by a hundred\nmillion isn't that the sort of the real\ndiscussion for that three-legged stool\nyou sort of like to talk about at times\nI think that's a very fair way of\nputting it yes sir the house had a hit\nto Medicaid of about 110 million roughly\nwe were able to put that back they uh we\nwere able we pulled some money out of\nMedicaid as well but it was fmap savings\nwhich is a truer cut it's a it's a it's\na real cut and matches with federal\ndollars and what federal funding is\ngoing to be set be set at so I do think\nit's probably fair to say yes if that\nwas their 100 million dollar move then\nours was probably on Regents we did put\nback the 100 million at Healthcare yes\nsir\nrecognize senator from the 27th\nhey Mr President Mr chairman do you\nyield yes sir I want to Echo the thanks\nthat you've heard I want to follow up on\nthe center from the first question he\nwas referencing 100 million dollars of\nAD back to the health side of the\nequation looks like a decent chunk of\nthat maybe even all of that that was\nremoved from the University system can\nyou help us understand that and and\nmaybe the how and the why\nsure I'll walk you through the first the\nwhere it came from uh roughly 18 million\nwas a health insurance ad at the\nUniversity budget\num we were not consulted on that I wish\nwe would have I'm sure we will be in the\nfuture but when we weren't weren't\nconsulted on that ad or that move that\nreally made low-hanging fruit if you\nwant to be honest if you probably want\nto go talk to the people with the money\nbefore you make that change uh but these\nthe others would have been roughly 88\nmillion out of the teaching formula\nthe reason being is as you knew we\nwanted to add back the funds that were\npulled at Medicaid\nand uh to do so you you got to find\nthose funds well the Board of Regents\nhas to give because of the former\nsenator from the 37th chairman tippins a\ncarry forward report each year it's\nactually on the handout that does the\nsummary on page three of that summary uh\nnotes that I see the chairman from the\n15th holding right now page three is the\nsummary page of those carry forward\nfunds\nthey're broken down in a full report\nI'll show you the full report I brought\nit up here with me just in case I got\nthis question it's it's the legislative\ncarry forward report from October of\n2022 breaks down to carry forward funds\nfor each agency now remember there are\nvery few agencies that are allowed to\ncarry forward funds and can't do so\nwithout asking OPB normally the\nlegislature does not carry forward funds\nif we don't spend our six thousand\ndollar allowance per member it returns\nback to the state treasury if DCH\ndoesn't they have to ask permission from\nopv if uh you know other agencies that\ndon't have guaranteed funds those are\nreturned and the university system does\nget a a\nan ability to hold carry forward funds\nthose last year totaled on page and\nwe'll see here I think it's three or\nfour of the report five of the reports\nthe third page in your summary\n504 million dollars\nso we thought if we have to figure out\nwhere those monies should be pulled to\nreimburse Medicaid that it made sense to\npull 20 percent only of the carry\nforward funds to do so\ncan I follow up on that just one more\nI've heard some comment in the Halls\nthat the small schools may be\ndisproportionately impacted I want to\nsay that that is not necessarily the\nfacts\nif you look at the Georgia Constitution\nArticle 8 section 4 paragraph 1\nsubsection C\nsays directly that the Board of Regents\nshall decide how their funds are\nallocated\nwe block grant over three billion\ndollars to the Board of Regents\nso if you're hearing from a small school\none of your smaller schools that hey\nwe're going to be disproportionately\nimpacted those bigger schools like\nGeorgia Southern and UGA and Georgia\nTech they can handle this carry forward\nhit we can't\nthey don't have to\nyou see article 8 section 4 paragraph\none subsection C says the ability to\nallocate those funds once they are\nblocked Grant over to the Board of\nRegents well that lies with the Board of\nRegents\nso if they wish to take these dollars\nmoves and make them less impactful for\nsouthern for smaller colleges they have\nthe full Authority not just by law but\nby the Georgia Constitution to do so\nso I do reject the notion that this\nshould have a disparate disparate impact\non smaller schools\n[Music]\nSenator recognizes\nuh recognized senator from 53rd\nMr President does the senator yield yes\nsir\nMr chairman there's no doubts you've got\na lot of weight on your shoulders and\nwhat you do and I don't envy you one bit\num I think you and I though would both\nagree that that Public Safety is one of\nthe first and foremost proper roles of\ngovernment and it's come to my\nunderstanding and I'd just like some\nclarification on it that the motor\ncarrier compliance isn't getting the\nsame raise that the gbi and the and the\nTroopers and everyone else is now that's\nvery important to the people of the\nNorthwest because Interstate 75 is the\nmost truck trafficked Interstate in our\nstate and Ringold we have a weigh\nstation there and I think the people of\nthe Northwest expect that if we give\ngood pay to officers we can expect good\nofficers to do the work so could you\nclarify why they weren't included in the\nrace sure I think that you have\nInterstate 59 as well am I correct and\nInterstate 24 as well\nthe uh yeah when we were moving the\ntrooper School Monies to figure out how\nwe would allocate increased raises we\nwere not trying to say anyone's better\nthan others that was not our goal what\nwe were looking to do is to\num\ncompensate those who have had increased\nduties I think there's a valid argument\nthat the MCC division has had that what\nwe focused on mostly were those who were\nhaving to respond to riots and Chaos\nduring the pandemic and I look forward\nto talking with you more offline and in\nconference about if there are others we\nleft out it was not intentional but for\nthe members of this body and those\nlistening for where we focused and why\nthat is why we focused where we did\nthank you Mr President members of this\nbody thank you again for allowing me to\npresent this budget and uh thank you all\nfor your Indulgence today I hope you can\nvote in favor

Amendment two to amend the\nsenate committee substitute to House\nBill 76 by striking line 129 and\nasserting therein and after nothing in\nthis bill shall add any additional\nrequirements or restrictions to clinical\npastoral counselors that completely\nrandom as president\nrecognize senator from the 28th\nthank you Mr President I bring to you\nall HB 76 and the underlying bills as it\narrived from the house uh it simply just\nrevises the licensure qualifications for\nmarriage and family therapists and\nbrings them into National standards now\nonce the bill arrived in committee we uh\nwe offered a couple of of amendments or\nI'm sorry we've offered a substitute and\nin that substitute I will go over the\nthe additions very briefly but one thing\nwe did was if if the governor or someone\nis removed from a a board or whatever\nthat is appointed by the governor there\nwas no mechanism for the governor to\nreappoint that person\num you know so they would have to wait\ntill that term was up so that vac that\nvacancy would remain\nvacant until uh till they got until the\nterm ended and so we added language that\nsimply allows the governor to do that\nand you can see that in uh where is that\nanyway it's in the bill and uh lines 120\nI'm sorry\num lines 120 through 123.\nand also I offered a uh as part of the\nsubstitute we also everyone's familiar\nwith the Georgia occupational review\nCouncil or whatever you call it\num and we've had issues with gork as we\ncall it we've had issues with we don't\nknow if the chicken or the egg comes\nfirst we introduce a bill and then it\ngoes to gork or\num or does it go to gork and then we\nintroduce the bill and it's very unclear\nand more importantly it really usurps\nthe legislative process and uh so we've\nwith with the issues we've had Through\nThe Years on licensing and I'm returning\nuh this power this wisdom back to the\nlegislature because I think y'all are\nthe the smartest and the brightest in\nthis state\nand I say that very unbiasedly\nand so we are simply going to get rid of\ngork\nand You Can Kiss It Goodbye so I would\nlove your support on that\nand then we've got a couple of\namendments that I'll speak to\nAmendment one which I offered uh along\nwith the great senator from the 50th uh\nthis is simply an industry that really\nis there's so few people\nthat partake in bare knuckle boxing\nuh and as we all know we're very limited\nin our time here as far as the committee\nprocess\nand so\num so I thought that I would just bring\nthis to the committee of the whole and\nlet us make a decision on this because\nthis is a standalone bill would never\num probably wouldn't see the light of\nday in committee nor make it to rules\nand never make it to the floor so this\nis really about the only way we can do\nit and so simply all we're trying to do\nis is is the for the very few people\nthat have bare knuckle boxing matches is\nreally just trying to make sure that\nit's done in a safe way and then it's\nand we're given the authority to the\nboxing commission to to regulate this\nand make sure it's done safely\num so I know the senator from the 14th\nhas great passion for this there is a\nlittle irony here that we're having bare\nknuckle boxing on with marriage licenses\nbut\num but it is uh it is in the same code\nsection and so it is germane and in some\ncases it's very germane unfortunately\nto on Amendment two offered by the\ncenter from the 19th I'll just speak to\nthat briefly\num the uh he had concerns with me about\nthe underlying Bill and and potential\nrestrictions that may be put on clinical\npastoral counselors so we just wanted to\nmake sure that was very clear that that\nis not the intent of this bill and I am\nauthorized to say by the house author\nchairman Powell\nsaid that he has vast knowledge and\nexperience with marriage counselors but\nhe has very little knowledge and\nexperience with pastoral counselors and\nso I didn't want to add that but but\noverall I support both amendments and\nencourage your favorable consideration\nof this fine piece of legislation\nthat all yield for questions\nyou do have a couple questions Senator I\nfigured\nsenator from the 27th\nthank you Mr President chairman yield of\ncourse I wasn't quite able to hear over\nhere senator from the 31st was was\ntalking during your presentation but did\nyou say that you're delivering a\nknockout blow to gork\nsooner I think that would be accurate\nand since the uh\nsince we're not we haven't regulated it\nyet I'm able to do that without any\nwithout it being I know how you love to\nregulate things but I appreciate the\neffort to uh deliver this bare knuckle\nknockout blow to gork well me being a uh\nkind of like things equal so I feel like\nif we're going to create some government\nthrough licensing and commissioning of\nbare knuckle boxing I thought it only\nfair to balance it out and get rid of\nanother government agency\nbalance is key moderation\nsenator from the 23rd encourage thank\nyou Mr President Senator yield I yield\nare you I want you to know I fully\nsupport The Knockout blow to court my\nquestion is the point of order is\namendment one germane to the underlying\nBill well if you're asking me my answer\nis yes but I think that question should\nbe directed to the uh I would lieutenant\ngovernor I would ask president of the\nSenate to make a decision on the the\ngermanness of the same code section\nAmendment one to the underlying bill\nI will take that into consideration\nSenator and uh but we're going to let\nthese other people get finished with\ntheir questions and and uh then I'll\nI'll look at the amendments there but\nthank you\nsenator from the 14th are you you want\nto speak to it\nsenator from the 56.\nthank you Mr President will the senator\nyield I do yield for my good friend from\nRoswell\nthe most powerful rules chairman uh the\nhome of gork\nI understand you have uh an ongoing\nbattle at gork is that not true\num it was true until today would you say\nyou're taking the gloves off now\nthey've been off baby\ngo get him\nbut I'll add you know we're not we're\nnot doing sanctioned brass knuckle\nevents only bare knuckle events\nSenator you got you have a history of\nboxing don't you don't I remember you\nbeing a part of a boxing club that is\naccurate it was not bare knuckle I had\ngloves in both instances and uh I\nretired at a career record of oh one and\none\nI remember your one and only fight\nSenator it was uh it wasn't pretty but\nuh well that was my one that was a well\nI'm not sure which one you were at\num you have no questions neither one of\nthem were pretty in my mind\nthank y'all yo\nI don't believe I don't believe there's\nany danger any Golden Gloves being given\nout there after that one\nso I recognize center from the 14th\nthank you Mr President and you know like\nthe center from the 28th I know what you\nall think when you look at me I can see\nit in your faces you look at me you\nthink now that's a guy who can handle\nhimself in a bare knuckle fist fight uh\nin all seriousness since we are\nsubmitting this to the committee of the\nwhole today I just want to give you a\ncouple quick facts about the bare\nknuckle boxing industry believe it or\nnot it is actually safer than boxing\nwith gloves over the last few decades\nthere have been studies that show that\nadding the mass with a glove and the\nfact that you feel more unrestrained\nquite candidly leads to greater numbers\nof concussions and hand injuries than\nthe bare knuckle version of the sport\nand so yeah you title uh you know tape\naround your fists and that might cause a\nslight increase in Cuts is what studies\nshow but that's not nearly as bad as the\nconcussions and the hand injuries that\nresult from more traditional forms of\nboxing so it's a safer version of sport\nan important limitation that's in this\namendment is that in lines 32 133 it\nsays only an individual has qualifying\nexperience can participate and that's\ndefined further up as somebody who\nessentially is a professional already in\none of the other fighting Sports so this\nis a to the the center's point a very\nlimited amendment that would just allow\na handful people to participate but with\nthat limited Amendment we would be able\nto take advantage of the the fast\ngrowing nature of the sport and be able\nto generate revenues uh through you know\npay-per-view and other events so I rise\ntoday in full support of amendment one\nyou know leave the procedural elements\nto the body to the president but this is\ngood policy and I think it'd be good for\nthe state of Georgia Thank you Mr\nPresident\ndoes any of the senator wish to speak\nfor against

from the 32nd to\nspeak to the bill\nour senator from the 50th to speak to\nthe bill\nthank you Mr President\ntoday I Rise to bring you House Bill 87\nalso known as the non-traditional\nspecial schools Act\num\nthe this bill began two two years ago\nwhen this body passed out Senate Bill\n153 which in essence\nwas going to close the doors of three\ncharter schools in the state of Georgia\nMountain education Foothills and coastal\nplains\nin response to their pending closure\na study committee was formed hundreds of\nhours were put in a lot of work was done\nby\nour friends across the hall interested\nparties across the state and ultimately\nwe've arrived here with House Bill 87\nwhich will allow these schools to\ncontinue to operate\nHouse Bill 87 establishes completion\nschools\nthese give children\nadditional options to to get their\ndegree\nchildren who can't go to school during\nthe traditional eight to three hours\nbecause of maybe having to help their\nfamily out\num and going to work\nthis allows them to have an option to\ncontinue to get their High School degree\nthis will help with Workforce\nDevelopment in the state this will help\nwith families in the state and it also\none of the the good consequences of this\nis it will help our military as some of\nyou may know in order to join the\nmilitary you have to have a high school\ndegree but\nthese schools are essential they're\nessential in our communities and quite\nfrankly I believe they're they're\nessential in making sure Georgia Remains\nthe number one state in the nation to do\nbusiness\nsome questions that I've received\nthroughout this process that I think it\nwould be important to take back to your\ndistrict is number one\nschool or students that are currently\nenrolled in these schools will be\ngrandfathered in nothing will change\nmoving forward\n18 year olds who are considered dropouts\nwill be allowed to enroll in these in\nthese schools and we'll have four years\nto complete their degrees those who are\nnot dropouts those who are either at\nrisk of dropping out behind on credits\nor who just need a non-traditional plan\nwill be allowed to enroll I have you\nknow two of these schools operate in my\ndistrict\nI've I've had the honor and privilege to\nattend one graduation that actually took\nplace at Lee Arendelle State Prison and\nI got to go inside the prison and watch\nthe graduation happen and to hear the\ntestimonies of the students that were\ngraduating along with alumni that came\nback to speak and the success stories\nthat these schools have had\nfor these children who otherwise would\nnot have received their high school\ndiploma\nit is inspiring\num\nand I I just I can't ask you enough to\nplease vote in favor of this piece of\nlegislation because thousands of\nchildren have benefited from these\nschools and what we are doing with this\nbill not only will keep the three\nschools alive today but moving forward\nwe are setting a course for more schools\nlike it to open and so with that Mr\nPresident I ask for favorable\nconsideration we happy to yield for\nquestions\nyeah you do have one question senator\nfrom the fourth you have a question\nsir you you I do yes sir um is it true\nthat over 6 000 students attend these\nthree different uh schools in the state\nyes sir over 6 000 students and is it\nalso true that there's six thousand\nstudents were dropouts and we probably\nwould have ended up in jail probably\nended up on the streets selling drugs\nprobably ended up teenage pregnancies at\nall and that's not happening now that's\ncorrect\nis it also true that these students have\nthe willpower and the want to go to\nschool from six o'clock at night to ten\no'clock at night because they're working\nduring daytime\nyou know Senator I I think the\nmotivation that I've seen from this this\nthese schools their students their\nalumni the number of handwritten letters\nthat I received over the past year is\nincredible and I would have to say that\nthe senator knows what he speaks would\nyou also agree that in this bill\num because of the passion that the\nsenator from the 12th has about her area\nthere will also be this same type of\nschools that will be created down in\nSouthwest Georgia to help out the\nstudents in that area\nthat is correct\nthank you Senator thank you\nsenator from the 32nd\nthank you we're at the senator yield yes\nI will yes\n[Music]\nexcelsis in my district in Cherokee\nCounty\nimportant\nI couldn't agree more\nSenator you have no further questions\nthank you Mr President I asked for\nfavorable consideration and we'll yield\nthe will thank you\nwe're going to senator from the 45th\nthank you Mr President uh I Rise as well\nin support of this Bill had passed out\nof our committee unanimously uh grateful\nto our partners in the house working\nwith them we did make three changes in\nthe Senate and just wanted to go over\nthose with you all real quickly but this\nthese schools the three schools the\nmountain Ed Foothills and coastal plain\nthey're vitally important for the\nstudents that attend there no matter how\nthey got their uh you know if they fell\nbehind in school or whatever it was\nwhere they couldn't complete school\nduring the regular school hours this\ngives them an option to go at night\nwhether they've got a job or whatever\nthe circumstance is so it's massively\nimportant that we keep these schools\nopen and keep these options open for\nthese children the three changes real\nquickly uh we added in working with with\nthe house we added in grandfathering\ncurrent students that were enrolled\nwhich affects my county and some of the\nother counties where in Gwinnett we're\nin the Metro Atlanta Risa but the\nstudents that are served are served by\nFoothills which is in Barrow County\nwhich is only about 2 20 minute 30\nminute drive for most clinicians but the\ngrandfathering lets a 111 students\ncontinue to be able to go to that school\nand there's other examples I could give\nyou throughout the state and also one\nother change we made was uh the Youth\nChallenge academies there's two of those\ncurrently looks like there may be more\nadded we want to make sure those schools\nstayed open and continue to serve those\nstudents as well and then the\nthe last one was contiguous counties if\nthey were in different Reeses and they\nwere contiguous to each other that those\nstudents could go there and they\nwouldn't miss out on those opportunities\nwith that Mr President I yield well\ndoes any of Senator wish speak for\nagainst the measure\nchair here zone is there objection to\nthe previous question being ordered\nchair here is none the previous question\nis

as senator\nfrom the fourth and the 27th the\nmajority leader this bill probably got\nas much work as any uh any bill down\nhere trying to help make sure we were\ntaking care of these charter school\nsystems that do a lot of good work and I\njust want to thank each and every one of\ny'all for the hard work that you did\nthey won't write it in the newspapers\nbut uh but it was a lot of good

fine\nsenator from the 8th District\nthank you Mr President three years in\nand four sessions in I still get nervous\nevery time I stand up here but uh\ncolleagues I Rise uh\nto encourage my Senate colleagues from\nAll Over Georgia not just rural Georgia\nto support HB 189 the truck weights bill\nin the form of a senate Transportation\ncommittee substitute\nI want to thank the chairman of the\ncommittee\nand the senator from the 51st for their\nwork on this bill over the last several\nweeks to include several committee\nhearings\nGeorgia's number one industry\nagriculture has benefited for the last\nthree years under our Governor's\nexecutive order by allowing trucks to\nhaul weights up to 95 000 pounds\nwith the governor's executive order just\nrecently expiring this bill would extend\nsimilar policy until July the first 2024\nby increasing the allowable weight from\n84 000 pounds to 88 000 pounds for\nAgricultural and forestry Products\nwhile this bill has a one-year Sunset\nand is a seven thousand pound decrease\nfrom the allowable weight and the\ngovernor's previous executive order it\nwill prevent further disruption in our\nsupply chain during a time of\ncompounding inflation specifically the\nbill is limited say again it's limited\nto Agriculture and Forestry it allows\nfor a 10 variance it restricts miles\ntraveler from the point of origin to its\ndestination to 75 to a 75 mile radius\nat Grants local law enforcement the\nability to weigh trucks if they have\nreasonable cause and scales\nthis is important to my Metro friends it\nrestricts Strokes from entering the\nnon-attainment area which is the greater\nMetro Atlanta area\nyou all know I have a great passion for\nRural Georgia\nI consider this bill to be a Lifeline\nfor the people that I represent that\nsupply the food and fiber to all of our\nconstituents\nit's worth remembering that 1.8 percent\nof this country farms\nbut the other 98.2 percent that don't\ntheir life depends on the 1.8 percent\nthat does\nwithout our number one industry we are\nno longer Georgia in closing I would\nremind my colleagues that all of our\nneighboring states have a variance of\neither 88 or 90 000 pounds\nvote green just like John Deere let's\nkeep Georgia growing in the right\ndirection\nfor that Mr President I'll be happy to\nyield for questions or I'll yield the\nwell you do have some questions Senator\nSenator from the 14th thank you Mr\nPresident senior yield yes sir senators\nare not true the beginning of this\nsession I started out as a no on this\nbill and we ran each other into each\nother in the hallway over and over again\nI was no no and then I put on my great\nAmerican collar hat and I thought about\nit and I got the yes is that not true\nthat is true Cinder and you look good in\nthat hat as well thank you Senator\nappreciate it thank you senator\nand I recognize the senator from the\n47th\noh you want to speak in the front Okay\nyou have no further questions Senator\nokay thank you Mr President I heard your\nfavorable consideration thank you\ncolleagues\nI recognize a senator from the 47th to\nspeak to the bill\ncolleagues this puts me in a really\ntough situation\nI've got ah actually by birth I have\nthree brothers but I have two more that\nare here in the chamber with me that are\nfraternity brothers and I think both of\nthem want to see this bill pass but you\nknow I'm going to tell you he said hey\nyes I'm a recovering chair\nTransportation committee and I I\nappreciate the senator from the 27th\nhe's he's worked hard to try to navigate\nwhere we're at on this piece of\nlegislation\nI sat down with the Georgia Forestry\nAssociation when when our new AG\ncommissioner introduced a bill to go to\n100 000 pound trucks and I said guys I\nwant to help you get competitive I want\nto help you raise the weight on trucks I\nwant to go to the the 10 variance\nbut there's a cost of doing that and\nthere's something that we need to take\ninto consideration and I want you to\nthink about what I propose to them and\nwhat it could mean for Georgia\nyou know a lot of people talk about\nForrest Gump and his sayings about\nstupid\nwell my goal is to stop stupid\ndown on my desk downstairs in my office\nhere at the Capitol I've got a citation\nfor a truck that went across the scales\nat a hundred and thirty thousand one\nhundred pounds\nladies and gentlemen that truck\nwas legally able to carry eighty\nthousand pounds meaning that that truck\nwas grotesquely overweight I think y'all\ncan do the math but more importantly for\nme\nI think that that's the kind of thing\nthat that will kill people the truck\nbecomes top heavy how to load of logs on\nit there's no way to say it that's the\ntruck that will will break down Bridges\nand tear apart roads and for me\npassing this legislation\nit's it's not good for Georgia it's not\ngood for our citizens\nI'm going to vote no on this bill but I\nwant to try to come back next year\nbecause this is a one-year bill\nthe if it does pass which I hope it does\nnot I want to help our forestry friends\nand our AG friends to do something\nthat's more permanent but here's what I\nwant you to think about and as I look\naround at some of our past chairmans of\nour transportation committee this is\nwhere it's important that we work\ntogether to improve Georgia\nputting grotesquely overweight trucks on\nthe road is dangerous for all of us not\nonly does it destroy our road system but\nit kills people\nwhen Senator Harper and I can say his\nname because he's not in the Senate\nanymore introduced a bill to go to a\nhundred thousand pound trucks within two\nweeks of that\neight miles from my house I had a log\ntruck coming around the corner on a\nstate highway\nthat tipped over into the front end of a\npickup truck\ntop heavy truck going around a curve and\nhe killed the pickup truck passenger\nSydney and driver and for me this is\nwhere I look at what we need to do is\nwe've got to stop stupid now when you\nlook at these truck weights that are\nlisted in here my suggestion was okay\nour partners and our and the people that\nwe want to help the most are our friends\nin forestry and AG\nthose crops that they're being grown\nwhether it be AG or forestry are going\nto a location that gets weighed\nI've asked our forestry friends and and\nAG components I said look guys if it\ncomes across your scales at 95 000\npounds or above I want to automatically\nhave access for the state of Georgia to\ntake those scales and issue a citation\nto that trucker right then the uh that\nthe the people that are going to\nrelinquish those funds are those buyers\nof those products so they know right up\nfront we're going to stop stupid and we\nmean it\nfor this they uh I I really troubled to\nhave my brothers that want to pass this\nbill the uh that are working hard and to\ndo the things that we need to do to keep\nGeorgia competitive with our surrounding\nstates but what we have to do today is\nwe've got to stop stupid this bill\npassing it is is what I call stupid and\nso I'll ask you to vote no I hate it\nthat it's this way if it does pass I\nwant to make sure that everybody in here\nunderstands next year when we take this\nup the uh we need access to those scales\nso that those people that are going in\nover 95 000 pounds automatically get a\nfine thank you for your attention\nrecognize senator from the 26th\nthank you Mr President\nladies and gentlemen\nI'm old vote for this bill\nuh\nsome on my conscience\nfirst of all\nlike you and a mad class you take\naccomplice\nand draw a circle\nand then you say I can't come in\nthat means I got to hire somebody\nin another truck\ncome take some weight off because I\nmight have a delivery at\nFamily Dollar Dollar General\nor any other vendor\nthe other thing is\nis strictly agriculture\nwell I've got constituents\nwho drive for a living\nand it's about the payload that's how\nthey make a living that's how they pay\ntheir taxes that's how they pay the\nhouse note the car note\nbecause Insurance send the kids to\nschool\nand I got a lot of friends\nthat end up drug business\nso now you tell them\nand AG trucks can't hold no dirt they\ncan't haul no gravel and they can't haul\nno time\nso you're gonna tell the folks who can\nfix the roads\nthat they came home\nand it's about the payload\nand the only reason I'm gonna vote for\nit\nMr President\nbecause it's going to get to the house\nit's gonna be a conference committed and\nI like to be on it\nand the only way you can get on it is\nyou have to vote for it\nbut\nwe have a bigger problem than that\nroads and bridges\nwe've got to find a way to put the money\nin the transportation to fix the roads\nand the bridges\nthis argument has been going on too long\nfor the last 20 years I know\nand I've heard from cities\nand some counties\nbut let me say to you we don't grow pine\ntrees in the city\nthey are grown in rural Georgia\nand you don't get any tax money until\nthose trees are cut\nto go in your Digest\nand then we got to haul them\nout of your garden\nthey take them to the mill\nso it's a two-way street\nin this same\ngovernment don't operate our water it\noperate off money\nright now we're going to take money out\nthe pockets of some folks\nfor a year\nand y'all know that ain't right\nwe ought to do what we need to do we\nought to fix the problem\nthat we've had plenty of money\nthat we've been giving away all year\nabout all the money we had\nwe ought to be giving that money to fix\nthese roads and bridges\nwe talk about these car plants coming to\nGeorgia\nbut when they come\nyou got to put an interchange there\nare we paying for The Interchange that\ndoes the energy\nexcuse me does The Interchange come out\nof Dot's regular budget\nwe need to think about that\nwe are growing state\nwe need to do what we need to do\nand stop it making excuses about why\nwe're not doing it\nthank you Mr President\nyou have no question senator\nand I believe I believe we put the house\nat a distinct disadvantage if I put you\non that conference committee right there\nwe wouldn't and we wouldn't want to do\nthat we wouldn't want to do that\nrecognize senator from the 27th\nthank you Mr President colleagues Mr\nPresident please send that Senator to\nconference with me I would love nothing\nmore than to serve with him and get more\ntime my good friend I think I'd just\ntake a few minutes y'all and unpack\nkind of a little history where we are\nwhy we're doing what we're doing\num for 2005 to 2020 before the pandemic\nwe lived under the current law which is\nto allow an 80 000 pound truck weight\nwith a five percent variance so 80 000\npounds in the variance of five percent\nbrings it to eighty four thousand I\nthink it's important to note that there\nis no variance on the interstates so\nwe're only talking about state and local\nroads so if you have a trucker who wants\nto essentially Traverse the state on the\ninterstate system they're gonna need to\nbe at 80 000 pounds either way during\nthe pandemic as the senator mentioned as\nhe was presenting the bill Governor Kemp\nincreased that to 95 000 we had lived\nunder that for approximately three years\nand about a week and a half ago that\nexecutive order expired and we are back\nto our 84 000 pounds for certain\nCommodities only I think that's the\nother important thing to mention is that\nthe current five percent uh exemption\nallowance is only for certain industries\namong those are Agriculture and Forestry\nbut also includes solid waste and\nconcrete and recycling materials and a\nnumber of other things one thing that we\nheard a lot of testimony about it is\nuniversally agreed that increasing truck\nweights will increase the degradation of\nour roads we don't there's a little bit\nof disagreement as to how much that\nwould be we heard everything from a\ntaking a 20-year Road lifespan down to\n12 years or potentially taking a 20-year\nRoad span down to eight 18 years I'm not\nhere to litigate who is right because\nfrankly I don't know but what I do know\nis that somebody is right\nand regardless of how right they are we\nknow that we're going to need to see\nmore funding in the state when it comes\nto our critical infrastructure\nthe commissioner of GDOT gave me a swag\nestimate that if we were to change to\nwhat the house had proposed that he\nwould need 500 million more dollars a\nyear for the maintenance on the state\nroads only that does not include any\nmaintenance on the local roads which\nwould also be impacted and I'm sure all\nof you have heard from your local County\nCommissioners Mayors and city councils\nas it relates to this issue\nthe other states surrounding us have\nmade significant Investments of both\narpa funds and their surpluses into\ninfrastructure when I talk about\nsignificant I'm talking about billions\nof dollars not tens of millions not\nhundreds of millions but billions of\ndollars of one-time funding that they\nhave made with their surpluses we have\nwe have as a state have not been able to\ndo that or have chosen not to do that so\nour our infrastructure needs need to be\nthought about when we talk about these\nweight changes something else we heard\nabout in committee was the safety issue\nit was highlighted a federal department\nHighway study looked at 80 000 pound\ntrucks versus 90\n000 pound trucks excuse me so different\nthan what we're talking about here but\nthey talked about a two foot stopping\ndistance difference between 80 000 pound\ntruck and a 90 000 pound truck so I know\nfor me when I first heard about this\nissue I thought that safety would be one\nof the primary things that we heard\nabout but I was surprised frankly in\ncourage to learn that you do not have a\nsignificant stopping distance between\nthose two trucks at those two weight\nlimits\nin the bill we contemplated the fact\nthat right now mccd is the only entity\nthat can enforce our truck weights the\nhouse sent us a bill that did not expand\nthat enforcement the Senate allows local\nlaw enforcement to purchase scales and\nenforce weights if they want to it also\ngives them probable cause to pull trucks\nover if they appear to be overweight and\nconduct a weight a weighing of that\ntruck additionally and this gets to um\nsenator from the 47th point about\nstopping stupid we increase fines in\nthis bill above and beyond what the\nhouse had done and we changed the total\ndistance traveled from The house's 250\nmiles to 75 miles\nwe limited this as the senator from the\nwho introduced the bill mentioned to\nonly the non-attainment are we sorry we\nprecluded the non-attainment zone so\nthese are areas that will revert back to\nthe law that was in place from 2025 to\n2020 and is back in place today I want\nto read those counties to you so you\nknow what those are and again these\ncounties will not apply to the\nadditional variance so they will be back\nat the 84 000 pounds for those\nCommodities these are the counties of\nCherokee Clayton Coweta Cobb DeKalb\nDouglas Fayette Forsyth Fulton Gwinnett\nHenry Paulding and Rockdale\nand then the last thing that we did and\nI think this may be the most significant\npiece of the bill is we put a sunset in\nthis bill for the middle of the year\nafter session next year why did we do\nthat\nI want to come back to the funding piece\nwe know that we have a funding problem\nand it's been proposed that we just put\na tax on the everyday citizens and\nfigure out a way to pay for the Freight\nLogistics funding and you can imagine\nwhat I think about that\nwe know that we need to get the freight\nand Logistics industry to the table to\nparticipate in the funding and we know\nthat if we did what the house did which\nis essentially give away all the\nleverage and not have a Sunset and give\nthem essentially exactly what they asked\nfor that there's no way they'll come\nback to the table to have the funding\nconversation that we need our funding\nneeds will be in the billions of dollars\nand we do not need to put that simply On\nThe Backs and solely on the backs of\nsomebody who shops at Amazon like\nColorado did and like had been proposed\nin the hallways here we know that we\nneed the industry at the table to have\nthat significant conversation so Mr\nchairman I lastly want to inform the\nmembers of this body that as the\nchairman of Transportation I spent\nextensive time\ntalking to my colleagues about this\nbuild essentially whipping this bill and\nthis bill as it came out of the house\nwas Dead on Arrival in the\ntransportation committee so we have\narrived at a carefully crafted\ncompromise a compromise that allows the\nvery important people of middle and\nSouth Georgia to do their work in the\nindustries of Forestry and agriculture a\ncompromise that addresses many of the\nconcerns of the locals who are worried\nabout funding who are worried about\nsafety who are worried about things like\nthe sunset most importantly who want the\nability to enforce these laws with\ninside their own jurisdictions\nso I would close my comments by saying\nI'm supporting the bill\nand I'm also saying that I've had\nadditional conversations with colleagues\nin this chamber to let you all know that\nwe need to encourage our house members\nas we talk to them to let them know this\nis the best deal they're going to get\nthey need to agree this to this bill and\nto this compromise we need to allow\nthese industries to move forward with\ncertainty for the next year and then we\nneed to come back for a very serious\nconversation about how we properly fund\nthe infrastructure in this state Mr\nPresident I'm happy to answer any\nquestions or I'm also happy to yield the\nwill you have one question Senator\nSenator from 47th\nthank you Mr President would chairman\nyield to my predecessor absolutely thank\nyou and and you know this is a delicate\ndance that we do down here every year on\nall the pieces of legislation my\nquestion for you is in committee we had\nthe motor carrier division testified to\nif they put every one of their law\nenforcements out\ntrying to do everything they can to\nenforce the truck weights you remember\nthe percentage that he said he could\nbarely get to but it was a single digit\npercentage I forget if it was two or\nfive but it was less than five percent\nand for me what I'm trying to do is is\nand I think that you would agree would\nit not be better for us to work with our\npartners so that we have a hundred\npercent in compliance by using the\ninformation that these scale operators\nhave when those logs and AG products are\ndelivered we would have a hundred\npercent compliance in Georgia is that\nnot true senator they would have 100\ncompliance but we certainly would have\n100 enforcement so we would have the\nability if when a log truck rolled into\na million was weighed and was overweight\nwe would have the ability to assess a\nfight at that point and I'll tell you\nSenator I'm all for all four having that\nconversation as we move forward what we\ndid in this bill I'll remind you those\nwe do allow locals to have the\nenforcement option they currently do not\nhave today so I think that that's an\nimportant thing that we need to discuss\nin the off session with those industry\npartners and find the best way to get to\nthe point of 100 compliance which I\nthink will be the goal for all of us in\nthis chamber thank you for your your\nwork on this thank you Rick and a\nsenator from the 56. thank you Mr\nPresident is Chairman yield I do\nchairman isn't it true that uh the three\nyears that Governor uh Kim suspended\nthat that we didn't see any major issues\nof Public Safety whatsoever is that not\ntrue I believe that is correct based on\nall the testimony we heard so Senator\nbased on that this just makes good\nprudent sense and the great work that\nyou and the team did so we can continue\nthis conversation to take care of both\nbusiness Public Safety uh and the\noverall goal of helping out World\nGeorgia is that not true I believe\nthat's 100 correct and I appreciate the\nquestion thank you Mr President I\nyielded well you have no further\nquestions\nrecognized as a senator from the 51st\nmajority leader leader\nthank you Mr President we're going to\nbring some\nprops up on the podium here to talk a\nlittle bit today but before I start\ntalking about the details and the bill\nI want to um\nI want to talk to you about\nour Department of Transportation\nour Department of Transportation\nis uh is led by commissioner Russell\nMcMurray\nmany of you know him uh by Russell if\nyou don't know the commissioner I\nencourage you to get to know him there's\nalso a planning director at GDOT her\nname is Janine Miller the planning\ndirector at D.O.T is hired by the\ngovernor\nthe commissioner of the D.O.T\nis hired by the board of the\ntransportation department of the Georgia\nDepartment of Transportation those board\nmembers are elected by the house and the\nSenate\nso essentially the commissioner of the\nD.O.T works for the board\nthrough us\nhe does not work for the governor\nthere's been comments made through this\nwhole process last year and this year\nthat I've sat by and watched and I've\nheard comments not from this chamber but\nI've heard comments from people out in\nthe hallways and I've heard\ncomments from house members who have\nquestioned his authority his ability his\nknowledge reputation of his job that\nhe's done while he's been the\ncommissioner of the D.O.T and whether or\nnot he should even be in this building\ntrying to advocate for or against\nlegislation let me remind you who the\ncommissioner is he's been at the D.O.T\nsince 1990. that's longer than some of\nyou have been alive I believe\nhe came into the D.O.T as a trainee\nafter graduating at Georgia Southern\nwith the civil engineering degree I\nfirst got to know the commissioner when\nI was a Seoul County Commissioner in\nLumpkin County in 2001 and I've known\nhim ever since so I probably have known\nhim longer than I've known anybody else\nin this building\nhe quickly moved up the ranks he became\nthe district engineer in the Gainesville\nDistrict\nhe moved to Atlanta became a\nconstruction project manager he became\nthe planning director for then Governor\ndeal\nand then he was later promoted to the\njob as commissioner of the D.O.T he\nserves on the MARTA board the third\naboard the Greta board he chairs the\nAmerican Association of State Highway\nand transportation officials which is\nknown as ashto\nhe chairs their standard their standing\ncommittee on Performance Management he's\nalso the president of the Southern\nAssociation of State Highway and\ntransportation officials known as sashto\nhe was named the Georgia Trend Man of\nthe Year Georgian of the year in 2018\nand let me remind you why that is we\nwere sitting in this room six years ago\nnext week when the I-85 bridge fire\ncaused that bridge to collapse you all\nthat were here remember the night when\nit happened we lost the 92 section\n92-foot section of Interstate 85\nwithin 43 days\nthe commissioner managed to replace\nthree sections of southbound and three\nsections of Northbound Lanes on\nInterstate 85. that was a record no one\nhad ever seen done in the United States\nour commissioner is the best in the U.S\nhe's definitely the best commissioner\nthat I've seen while I've been involved\nin local and state government we need to\nlisten to our experts he has a chief\nengineer by the name of Meg perkel\nthey're here to help us legislate\nthey're here to give us advice and I\nwant to thank he and his staff for the\nwonderful job that they have done\nguiding us over the years especially\nsince we passed House Bill 170 in 2015\nso if it's not out of order Mr President\nI'd like to recognize commissioner\nMurray with a round of applause at this\ntime\nif\nnow he's not here in this room today but\nwhen you see him\nI'm sure he is somewhere not far from\nhere listening to this conversation when\nyou see him tell him thank you for the\njob that he and his 4 000 employees do\nfor us\nthere's a letter on your desk\nthis information is very accurate the\nD.O.T the local governments are not\nsupporting this bill publicly they have\nbeen working with us they have worked to\nget to the compromise that we have today\nand as it may not sound like I support\nthe bill as I continue my conversations\nI'm asking you to support this bill I\nwill vote for this bill for many of the\nsame reasons that the current chairman\nof Transportation supports it and of\ncourse our AG chairman he supports it he\nis passionate about AG but before you\nhear I want to just talk a little bit\nabout what roads look like in Georgia if\nyou're a county commissioner in rural\nGeorgia you don't see roads that have\nasphalt as thick as this here or asphalt\nas thick as this core sample here\ninstead what you have are a bunch of\ndirt roads with very little base and\nCounty Commissioners have a hard\nstruggle with this they have limited\nfunds they come into office and the\nfirst thing they get is a phone call\nfrom their neighbor who said my dirt\nroad has been muddy and full of potholes\nmy entire life I want you to pave my\ndirt road and so County Commissioners\nwant to please as many people as they\ncan so they set out to do so they start\nout with three to four inches of\naggregate base which is this gravel with\na little bit of sand mix in it and they\nput one to two inches of Chip seal on it\nchip seal is nothing but gravel and tar\njust a real thin layer and a lot of cars\nand trucks will drive on that for years\nwhen you put a hundred thousand pound\ntruck on that chip seal it will not last\nvery long at all those roads are built\njust basically to get people out of the\nmud as you start to get into more of a\nstate route\nspecification this is where the D.O.T\nhas set their specs today or C you'll\nsee six to nine inches of aggregate base\nwhich is gravel and then they require\nthree to five inches of asphalt if you\nmove to the federal highways in Georgia\nespecially down around the ports where\nthese two senators are from\n15th District in the first district I'm\nsorry the second district in the first\ndistrict you will see\nbigger roads being built with concrete\nand asphalt so they'll start out with\neight to ten inches of gravel as a base\nand then they'll put eight to ten inches\nof asphalt on top of that and then\nthey'll put 10 inches of concrete on top\nof that gravel\nand so you can see the thickness of that\nroadway now compare that to this three\nor four inch piece on a state route or\neven compare it to a local County Road\nthat I described where there's one to\ntwo inches of asphalt what do you think\nthe best weight should be the heaviest\ntruck should be right here that's common\nsense the federal government only allows\n80 000 pounds of weight to be on this\ninterstate route this is a core that was\ntaken off of Interstate 75. this is an\nactual profile of the asphalt and the\nconcrete that is on that road today\neighty thousand pounds is a federal law\non this road\nwe want to put ninety thousand or a\nhundred thousand pounds on these State\nroutes or even worse on a County Road or\na city street that's only two to three\ninches thick\nmy point of saying all this is this\ndiscussion doesn't end today we'll pass\nthis bill and we'll send it over to the\nhouse and I'm like the senator from the\n27th I'm not interested in a bill coming\nback that has added more exceptions or\nmore weights what we want to do is have\na conversation over the next 12 months\nwith the industry people that are in the\ngallery and out in the hallways and our\nmembers over in the house we want to\nhave a serious conversation about how do\nwe fund our roads going forward to where\nwe can get from a two inch County Road\nasphalt tomorrow like what we see on a\nstate route or even closer to this kind\nof this this construction specification\nthat you see on the interstates so I'm\nasking you to vote for the bill but I'm\nasking you even more so going forward\nthat we support the freight and\nLogistics plan that has just been\npublished and that's going to require\nfunding and that's where we come in next\nyear we're going to have to help find\nthe Monies to build these roads and\nbuild the infrastructure in our state we\nalso can't forget how important the\nrelationship is going to be with our\nclass one railroads and our Short Line\nrailroads in this state very important\npart of the puzzle is to have our\nrailroads in place make sure they're\nupgrading their Crossings make sure\ntheir safety precautions are in place\nand it's going to require funding as\nwell our ports are one of the fastest\ngrowing in the nation\nwe want to continue to support our\nEconomic Development engine that we have\nin Georgia but we simply cannot do it if\nwe do not show the commitment of funding\ngoing forward so ladies and Gentlemen\nplease support this bill\nfor a one year's time and we will be\nback next year with more information and\nmore requests for your help Mr President\nI'll take any questions you may have you\ndo have a question couple questions\nSenator Senator from the 28th\nthank you Mr President Senator do you\nyield I will yield for the rules Sherman\nuh Senator do you live near Elbert\nCounty by chance I do not would that be\nthe granite capital of Georgia uh maybe\nuh\nthank you Mr President Senator did he\nfurther you I do\ndo you know where you were on July 6\n2022\nI could look at my calendar if that's\nreally your if you'll further yield I'm\nI've got I'm a little concerned because\non July 6 2022 the Georgia Guidestones\nwent uh were dismantled in Elbert County\nand I'm just making sure you're not the\nah\nwell I cannot confirm or deny my\nwhereabouts on July 6 2022. thank you\nsir yes sir\nyou do have another question hopefully\nserious serious serious question senator\nfrom the 12th please\nthank you Mr President\nwith the Senate and the will yield for a\nseries of just a couple of questions is\nit not true that deep in Southwest\nGeorgia I live on a dirt road yes ma'am\nI have lived on that dirt road for the\nlast 20 years\nI believe the senator knows of what she\nspeaks yes sir is it also not true that\nmost times the Commissioners the County\nCommissioners will prioritize rolled\nPavements based on the number of homes\nthat are on that road\nit is is it also not true that the\nmajority of the paved County roads in my\ndistrict all have the Commissioners\nnames on those paved roads whether they\nhave one house on there which would\nbelong to the commissioner or no houses\nis that also true that is very true\nSenator yes sir that's very very true\nthank you very much thank you appreciate\nthat you have no further questions\nSenator thank you very much please\nsupport the bill and uh I'll give the\nwill\nI would remind the majority leader we\nusually don't have props but since you\nthe majority leader we just won't have\nto pass on it you know\nall right I recognize senators from the\n21st please\nthank you Mr President I'll be brief I\nwould say that when this bill first came\nover from the house I was a hard no\nI am going to support this bill today\nI'm going to support the AG chairman I\nwant to thank the chairman of Senate\nTransportation the senator from the 27th\nfor his hard work I want to thank the\nsenator from the 51st for his hard work\nand and also the AG chairman and our\nlieutenant governor\num you know the senator from the 27th\naddressed you know the wear and tear on\nthe roads the safety and the funding\nwhat I want to talk about is Freight and\nLogistics funding the long-term plan we\nmust have we have studied Freight\nLogistics for four years and we know\nwe're going to need to invest in our\ninfrastructure we had a presentation\nfrom commissioner McMurray who I do\nthink is one of the best DOT\nCommissioners in the country\nand I will tell you that there was one\nslide that really caught my attention\nin the next 10 years the poor the\nSavannah area is going to go from 100\nmillion square feet of industrial space\nto 200 million square feet double in\nsize and you're going to have the\nHyundai plant open up in Savannah\nnow there's already a lot of 18 wheelers\nand trucks coming out of the Port of\nSavannah it's an economic engine for our\nstate\nbut we have got to address the funding\nbetween now and next session because\nroads take six to eight years to build\nand if Savannah doubles in size in 10\nyears we're going to be behind the eight\nball if we don't address it so uh I\nwould just say this that I'm going to\nsupport this bill I'm glad it has a\nsunset so the industry will come back to\nthe table and we can we can work on a\nlong-term\nFreight and Logistics plan as the\nsenator from the 26 stated we've got to\nmake sure we invest in infrastructure I\nsay this a lot and I'll end with this\nthere's a direct correlation between\ninfrastructure investment and economic\ndevelopment and jobs Mr President if I\nhave no questions I'll yield the well\nyou have no question Senator does any\nother Senator wish to speak for against\nthis measure chair here is none here's a\nrejection to the previous question being\nordered\nchair here has known the previous\nquestion is ordered I recognize senator\nfrom the 8th\nto close debate\nthank you you know there's one thing uh\ncolleagues\nI tell people when I go back home\nthere's a lot of special interests out\nin that hallway there's a lot of special\ninterests everywhere people big money\nfolks they can hire their lobbyists but\nyou know what my job is to be and what\nall of our jobs is is to be a lobbyist\nfor the Common Man\nthat is our job we had a ag Committee\nhearing yesterday where we come in and\nhad the folks from epd because it's a\nvery important issue with uh the senator\nfrom the 12th from the senator from the\n11th because their Farmers have been\nunder a moratorium for 12 years they\ncan't drill a well so if you live in\nQuitman County Georgia you can't drill a\nwell but if you go four four feet across\nthe line you can put a straw in and\ndrill a well in Barber County Alabama\nwell you know what else we're telling\nthose Farmers you know what else we're\ntelling those farmers in Quitman County\nGeorgia we're telling them that\nin Alabama you can haul 88 000 pounds\nbut in Georgia you can only haul 84 000\npounds and so for the people that live\nin my district and for the people all\nacross this this this this state a small\nfamily logging business that's got two\nSkidders a cut down machine and a loader\nthey're going to do about 1.7 million\ndollars a year in Revenue\nthe difference between 84 and 88 000\npounds for that business y'all\non a 50 mile average Hall on 60 loads a\nweek is 154\n000 a year so we as Georgia Farmers we\nhave the prevailing wage is 14 an hour\nbut we're buying tractors with tier four\nengines instead of tier one engines in\nMexico the people we're competing with\nthey're still buying tier one engines\nevery day\nwe're doing the same thing in our state\nto our Farmers when every farmer that\nlives in a state that touches us can\nhaul four to six thousand more pounds on\nthe road than what our farmers can do\nand I will just close with this ladies\nand gentlemen I want to thank so much my\ncolleagues of the lieutenant governor\nthe members of the transportation\ncommittee especially the chairman for\neverything they've done but I will close\nwith this and it's a pretty profound\nstatement in my opinion you see it on\nbumper stickers all over this state no\nFarms no food Mr President

Mr\nPresident\nthe senator from third has moved that\nhb128 be taken from the table is their\nobjection that objection recognize\ncenter from the third speak to the\nmeasure\nthank you Mr President colleagues I have\nHouse Bill 128 hits Governor's bill on\nJuly in July of 2022\nGovernor did an executive order to the\nDepartment of administrative services to\naddress challenges\nthat small businesses experience in the\nstate's procurement process the goal was\nto cut red tape in that process and to\nsupport small businesses\nthe doas issued a report\ncalled small business and suppliers\ndiversity in October\nthey talked with 28 stakeholder they had\n28 stakeholder meetings and they had 600\nindividual interactions this bill is a\nproduct of the challenges that were\nidentified in that report built us four\nthings number one\nit decouples the state from Federal\ndisadvantaged Business enterprise\nprocess previously a dbe would have to\nget that certification from the federal\ngovernment and then the state and they\ndid it through the DOT\nsecondly the second thing it does it\nbrings the state MBE program and process\nunder the department of administrative\nServices rather than the DOT\nthe the doas will set policy and\nguidelines for the MBE certification the\nFED process is still available under dot\nbut this will help people who are\nnon-transportation vendors\nthe third thing it does it adds the\ncertification process available to\nminority business enterprises it adds\nalso women-owned businesses and\nveteran-owned businesses to that process\nand I'll tell you that in Georgia\num\nwe have Georgia ranks number three in\nthe nation in minority business\nenterprises 37 percent of our small\nbusinesses are minority owned about 470\nbusinesses\nbut uh women\nwe rank number five in the nation 46\npercent of our small businesses are\nowned by women about 470\n000 businesses\nand then veterans we rank number four in\nthe nation seven percent of our small\nbusinesses are owned by veterans about\n76 000 businesses\nthen the last thing that this bill does\nis it incentivizes\nwhat the bill calls Prime contractors\nwhat you and I might might call a\ngeneral contractor\nwith a tax deduction equal to 10 percent\nof the payments that they make to an MBE\nsubcontractor that deduction's been\navailable since 1991 but this bill will\nalso add women-owned businesses and\nveteran-owned businesses to that so the\nsum total of this bill is it will help\nuh minority-owned businesses women-owned\nbusinesses and veteran-owned businesses\nto better navigate the procurement\nprocess in the state of Georgia and it\nwill support small businesses Mr\nPresident I yield for any questions you\ndo have one question senator from the\n15th you wish to ask for a question\nthank you Mr President Senator yield I\nwill sir Senator I was looking for you\nmade a reference to decouple from\nFederal Regulations\nwhat is that well previously Senator\nwhat that means is expected in another\narea or something now previously to get\ncertification as a minority-owned\nbusiness there was a federal process you\nhad to go through first you went through\nthe dot and then you got your state\nprocess now you don't have to go through\nthe dot say you're a business and you\nhave you're a vendor and you don't\nhandle Transportation type issues you do\nsomething else um and this way you don't\nhave to go to the dot you just go to the\ndoas okay and get that certification\ncenter for the year for one more\nquestion certainly wants to under\nsection three it strikes certain terms\nspecific terms and it yields on the\nother page line 47 classified subject\ncontract of means a small business\ncertified as a minority business\nEnterprise women and Veteran but it no\nlonger you uh refers to a minority\nAfrican-American assembly so does that\nput more embracing or I'm just trying to\nunderstand why they strike those\nspecific references also um\num Senator I would\nif you look at uh line\num\n10 108\ngo to 108 108.\nyes you see is Houston\nthis part minority means an individual\nwho's a member of a race which comprises\nless than 50 percent of the total\npopulation of the state and is black\nHispanic Asian Pacific American Native\nAmerican or Asian Indian\nthanks
