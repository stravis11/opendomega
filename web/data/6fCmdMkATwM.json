It's an honor to\nbe here today on this beautiful Monday\nmorning. And colleagues, it's truly a\npleasure to introduce Billy Smith,\npastor of Christ Chapel Church in\nZebulun, which he serves in West Central\nGeorgia. And the church has eight\nbeautiful campuses. Pastor Billy is\nknown for his servant leadership, strong\nfaith, and his genuine heart for people.\nUnder his leadership, Christ Chapel has\ndone tremendous things through outreach\nand volunteer efforts, meeting real\nneeds, strengthening families, and\nmaking meaningful different uh\ndifference across our communities.\nBeyond his ministry, Billy is the proud\nfather of four beautiful children and\nthe loving wife, loving husband to his\nwife, Tina. He leads through humility,\nspeaks with conviction, and serves with\nconsistent consistently. I am very\npleased to call Billy Smith my friend.\nHe is always there. I've reached out to\nhim many times over the years just\nneeding to have a sounding board to hear\nhis opinion. He's always very kind and\nvery generous in that. And so this\nmorning, I'd like to introduce Pastor\nBilly Smith. Thank you.\n>> Good morning, everybody.\nI was told years ago uh by an older\npastor, he gave me some advice. He said,\n\"He who is short- winded shall be heard\nagain.\" Uh, so if you want to share that\nwith your pastor for Sunday services,\nthat'll be fine. Thank you,\nRepresentative Camp, for the invitation\ntoday. Uh, she represents our district\nso well. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for\nthe opportunity. Uh, I can do three\npoints in three minutes if you can\nlisten fast. How about that? We'll make\na deal right now. Faith that lasts.\nFaith that lasts. Point number one,\nfaith has to believe when it can't see.\nOften in the Christian faith, uh God's\nasking us to step out and do things that\nwe can't really see how it's going to\nturn out. We'd like to face situations\nthat have obvious answers, but they're\nnot always so obvious. Sometimes the\nbills stack up, our health has a shift,\nuh we have a relationship that's\nstretched or strained, and life doesn't\nalways just give us what we ask for.\nHebrewsap 11:1 says, \"Faith is confident\nin what we hope for and the assurance of\nwhat we do not see.\" Uh, and let's be\nhonest, some of you here are my age or\nolder. There's a few of you maybe\nyounger, but I have these things I call\ncheaters. These are reading glasses.\nMost of you have those. We probably have\n25 pair at my house. We can't find them,\nbut we have 25 pair. And last week, I\nwas walking around the house looking for\na pair, and I went into the bathroom. I\nthought maybe I left them on the counter\nthere and they weren't there. But I\nlooked over the sink in the mirror and\nthey were on top of my head. I don't I\nknow none of you have ever done that\nbefore. But even even sometimes when God\ndoesn't seem near, our our faith seems a\nlittle bit lost. He's always close. Even\nif we don't see him, if we don't feel\nhim, he's always near. So faith believes\nwhen it can't see. Point number two,\nfaith obeys when it doesn't understand.\nAnd sometimes God just asks us to do\nstuff that doesn't seem to have a clear\nexplanation. We like timelines and\nguarantees in life, but that's not what\nfaith is about. Uh faith rarely comes\nwith a blueprint. James says it this way\nin scripture. He says that faith without\nworks is dead. It requires us to do\nsomething. Uh sometimes God's\ninstructions feels a little bit like a\nGPS system. The navigation in your car.\nUh, I'm from a hour and a half south of\nhere, hour and 10 minutes south of here,\nand I'm in a rural area. And sometimes\nwhen the GPS uh tells me to go in a\ncertain direction, I get confused\nbecause it sends me through a corn field\nor it takes me down an old dirt road.\nAnd you know what I found out though?\nTypically that GPS gets me where I'm\nsupposed to go if I'll just follow it.\nEven though I don't understand the\nsteps, sometimes if I'll just follow, I\nget where I'm supposed to be. And it's\nlike that with our faith. Often Noah in\nthe Old Testament was building a boat. a\ncrazy size boat with limited\ninstructions. But his faith just allowed\nhim to continue to build. Even though he\ndidn't understand all the pieces yet,\nhis faith in God was strong. Point\nnumber three, faith endures when it\nwants to quit. I don't know about you\nguys, but there have been a few moments\nin my life, few times that I felt like\nthrowing the towel in. I felt like\nquitting. Uh I have board meetings as\nwell with Christian men usually and\nwomen. And uh you would think that would\nalways turn out well, but sometimes it's\ndifficult. It's hard sometimes and\nsomebody giggled because they've been in\none of those recently, right? We all\nsometimes want to quit. Um, it's easy to\nbe excited about things in the\nbeginning, but I like people who finish\nstuff. At the at the first of the year\nthis year, we know that gyms, local gyms\nhad a uh had record numbers of people\nsign up to get in shape. Uh, some of you\nmay have signed up to get in shape. Uh,\nthe third Friday of January is called\nNational Quitters Day, in case you're\nwondering.\nThe road to hell is paved with good\nintentions, right? And but faith needs\nto be something that helps us finish\nthis journey that God's given us all to\ndo. Everybody in this room has an\namazing calling on your life. And I want\nto have the kind of faith that lets me\nfinish. Trials really do refine our\nfaith the way that gold is refined and\nfire. The Apostle Paul wrote half of the\nNew Testament almost and he said this,\n\"We walk by faith, not by sight.\"\nMeaning we keep walking even when the\npath is hard and the path is difficult.\nThree points in three minutes. Faith\nendures when it wants to quit. Faith\nbelieves when it can't see and faith\nobeys when it doesn't understand. And I\npray today that your faith in Christ\nremains strong. Would you stand today\nand allow me to pray over you.\nLord, thank you for this day and your\ngoodness and your kindness. I'm grateful\nfor the men and women in this room who\nserve our state so well. Would you give\nthem today the uh wisdom and discernment\nand clarity as they make decisions. Uh\nthank you for allowing us to live in\nthis wonderful state. I think it's the\nbest in the whole USA. I really do. I\nlove Georgia. Thank you for your\nblessings. We love you today in Christ's\nname. And we say together, amen. Would\nyou join me for the pledge today? I\npledge allegiance to the flag\nof\nthe stands\nindivisible with liberty and justice for\nall.\n>> Thank you for your time.\n>> Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.\nMembers may meet the chaplain in the\nsouth anti- room.\nchair recognizes Chairman Hilton, the\nchair of the committee on information\nand audits.\n>> Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Thank you,\nma'am.\n>> Thank you, sir.\n>> Ladies recognized.\n>> Mr. Speaker and members of the House,\ntoday I rise to honor the life and\nlegacy of Melvin Kent, a gifted\nsongwriter from New York. Although\nMelvin Kent never reached his full\npotential in his lifetime and faced\nprofound hardship, including\nhomelessness and moments of lost hope,\nhis story did not end there. One day he\ndiscovered that a song he had written in\nthe 60s or 70s had been recorded by\nAlicia Keys, a globally respected artist\nknown for her authenticity, artistry,\nand cultural impact. You don't know my\nname, has reached audiences far beyond\nstates and international lines. In that\nmoment, Melvin Kent was given a second\nchance and a second win. He returned to\nhis songwriting dream with renewed\npurpose. Tragically, he passed away just\nsix months later later, never fully\nknowing how widely his work would be\ncelebrated. Today, his song continues to\nlive on, including being featured in the\nstage production of Hell's Kitchen.\nMelvin Kent never knew how famous his\nwork would become, but his legacy will\nforever be enjoyed. I'm proud to say\nMelvin Kent is and always will be my\nuncle. Thank you, Uncle Melvin. Thank\nyou, Mr. Speaker.

We cannot honor them\nwithout confronting the truth. In\nGeorgia, approximately 2,000 people are\nkilled by guns each year and thousand\nmore are wounded, placing our state\namong the highest in the nation for\nfirearm deaths. And we know it firsthand\nright here in Georgia. Amy St. Pierre\ndied a few years ago in a Midtown\ndoctor's office. And just over a year\nago, a 14-year-old armed with\nsemi-automatic rifle killed two students\nand two teachers at Appalache High\nSchool. A horror that reminds us all how\nfragile school safety can be. When we\ntalk about school safety, metal\ndetectors and panic buttons are fine,\nbut they are a band-aid. They react\nafter the gun has arrived and the harm\nhas begun. What we need are laws that\nmake guns less accessible to people who\nshouldn't have them. Safe storage,\ncomprehensive background checks, and\nsensible limits. Please talk to these\nfolks who are all around the capital\ntoday.

House Bill 957 by\nRepresentative Clifton of the 131st and\nothers to be entitled act to amend title\n40 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating to motor vehicles and\ntraffic so as to provide for the\noperation of miniature on-road vehicles\non certain highways. This bill referred\nto the committee on motor vehicles. That\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass.\nRepresentative Rob Clifton from over in\nColumbia County and some other parts is\nrecognized to present House Bill 957.\nRepresentative Clifton.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh ladies and\ngentlemen, I'll be quick. Uh this is the\nmini truck bill. It's the exact same\nbill we passed out of the House last\nyear. um hoping to get it a little bit\nfurther along this year. So, um I'll be\nreal quick about the bill. We are adding\nmini trucks and allowing them to be\ndriven on county and city roads. Um the\nvehicles have to be older than 25 years\nold. This is very similar to what we did\nwith side by sides um few years back. Um\nwe're just adding we're creating a\ndefinition for mini truck and adding\nthat word um into the section. Mr.\nSpeaker, with that I will yield for\nquestions.\nGentleman has a couple of questions.\nUh, Park Whip Whip Park, I'll get that\nright. Has a question. You can either\none either way you want to go with that.\nThere we go. The gentleman's recognized\nfor a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes. Uh, so I had two questions. Um,\nfirst on line 19, the definition of a\nminiature on-road vehicle states that\nthese are imported vehicles. Are any of\nthese miniature trucks domestically\nmanufactured?\n>> So domestic manufacturers would have to\nread the meet the federal guidelines um\nand therefore they would not apply to\nthis bill. They would already be allowed\nto be driven.\n>> So So this would just permit foreign\nimported vehicles on our county and\nlocal roads.\n>> That's correct. Do you know how many\nmanufacturers this would potentially\nbenefit? Foreign manufacturers potent\npotentially benefit?\n>> I do not. I know there's a lot of these\nvehicles already over here because\npeople are bringing them over and using\nthem for personal use. So, we're just\nallowing individuals to be able to use\nthem on county and city roads.\n>> Does a gentleman you have for one more\nquestion?\n>> Yes. Uh with respect to um the local\ncontrol aspect, um you know, I know the\nbill allows for cities and counties to\nopt out, but does it require any sort of\naffirmative action from local\ngovernments in order to opt out? Does it\nrequire any additional funds or\nexpenditures uh for a city or county to\nsay we don't want these on our on our\nstreets? Um, so as far as local control,\nif cities do not want these on their\ncity and county roads, then they can um\nenforce that and um get that message out\nthere however they deem fit.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Representative Chaz Cannon to your right\nis recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes, I do. If I were to have one of\nthese uh mini trucks on private\nproperty, could I use it to shoot feral\nhogs with?\n>> Uh if we can get this bill passed and\nthe governor will sign it. Absolutely.\nYes, sir. We can.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n>> Leader Estrations recognized for a\nquestion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Representative U, what are the\ndifferences in this legislation compared\nto the mini truck legislation that this\nHouse has passed overwhelmingly\nwhat seems like several years in a row.\n>> The only difference between this bill\nand last year's bill is the date. We\nchanged uh 2025 of last year to 2026\nthis year for when it will go into\neffect. There's nothing else that has\nbeen changed.\n>> No other change from when this house has\npreviously passed this same language. It\nsounds like repeatedly over the past few\nyears as I recall.\n>> That's correct.\n>> And do you yield for one other question?\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> You uh referenced that this follows the\num side byside structure and that it's\nlocal roads speed restriction. Um is\nthat framework consistent with how local\ngovernments would deal with types of\nvehicles like these as prepare as\nproposed in this legislation? In other\nwords, with respect to how we've treated\nsimilar vehicles, does your bill follow\nthat framework?\n>> Yes, sir. Absolutely.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Representative Jasmine Clark to your\nleft is recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes. Um, can you explain just I'm very\ncurious about why they need to have been\nmanufactured for 25 years. So, these are\nquite old by the time they're allowed to\nbe on our roads. Is that correct?\n>> Yes, it is. Federal guidelines requires\nany um automobile um within earlier or\noutside of this time frame to meet\nfederal guidelines and therefore that is\nnot something we are trying to overrule\nat this point. Uh, so this brings par\nwith federal guidelines,\n>> I believe. So,\n>> all right. Thank you.\n>> Representative Gamble up the center\naisle is recognized for a question.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does\nthe gentleman yield?\n>> Yes, sir. Uh, is it not true that you\nand I have had extensive conversations\nabout this legislation and and why we\nneed this clarity and that I have a lot\nof constituents who have talked to me\nabout how important this is and I'm\nlooking forward to uh voting in support\nof this legislation.\n>> Yes, sir. I appreciate it. And I will\nadd, you would be very surprised to see\nthe amount of emails I have gotten on\nthis bill with support asking um me to\nrun it get it all the way through. Um\nthere's a lot of support behind these\nvehicles that people are very unaware\nof. Thank you.\n>> Sounds like you got two votes. Anyway,\nlet's see. Uh Chairman Gullet is\nrecognized for the final question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen,\nyield.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> Doesn't this just really set clear\nminimum requirements for these vehicles\nto be used on roads safely?\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thank you so much.\n>> Thank you, speaker. I will yield the\nwell and ask for your f favorable\nconsideration.\n>> The gentleman has yielded the well.\nWe have no further discussion on the\nbill. Is there any objection to the\nprevious question being ordered? Hearing\nnone, the previous question is ordered.\nIs there any objection to agreeing to\nthe report of the committee which was\nfavorable to the to the passage of the\nbill?

And Mr. Clerk,\nwill you unlock the machine?\nFor what purpose does Chairman Thomas\nrise?\n>> Parliamentary inquiry.\n>> State your inquiry. Is it not true that\nI was the only member of this body to\nvote against this bill last year, but I\nam voting for it this year.\n>> Well, I think a lot of a lot of other\npeople changed their mind, too, I guess.\nWell, you've seen the light. I can tell.\nSo, I'm glad you're educated. That's\nwhat we do here. When we disagree with\neach other, we um we educate those\nmembers.\nFor what purposes, Representative Whip\nBerett rise?\n>> Parliamentary inquiry. State your\ninquiry. Is it not true that the bill\nallows for local control by allowing for\nthe city or county to prohibit by\nordinance or resolution these many\ntrucks? Is that not true, Mr. Speaker?\n>> Sounds like you've read the bill.\nNo further questions. Have all members\nvoted?\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine on the passage\nof House Bill 957? The yays are 162, the\nnays are five. This bill, having\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority, is therefore passed.\nBoy, y'all, I have a great honor. I got\nthe boyans up here with me.\nWe're going to take a photo soon as we\ncall this next bill.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption to\nHouse Bill 676?\nHouse Bill 676 by Representative Clifton\nof the 131st and others to be entitled\nan act to amend part three of article 8\nof chapter 14 in title 44 of the\nofficial code of Georgia annotated\nrelating to mechanics and materialmen\nrelative to leans so as to provide for a\nfine for any frivolous mechanic lean\nfiled. This bill referred to the\ncommittee on judiciary. That committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass.\nRepresentative Rob Clifton is recognized\nto present another bill. There's a\nreason you kind of doing these things\ntoday, isn't it?\n>> Yes, sir. And if I could take a moment,\nI want to thank you and leadership for\nallowing me to run these bills today. My\nwife uh started contractions yesterday.\nSo, um this baby is coming sooner than\nlater. So, I'm going to try to get all\nthis done. And uh I appreciate you and\nyour leadership, sir.\n>> You have 30 seconds to be done with your\nbill. You need to get home.\nThe gentleman's recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um today I have\nHouse Bill 676. Um this is a frivolous\nlean bill. So the law and the code is\nvery specific on what you need to do or\nin order to have lean rights. Uh\nunfortunately in today's day and age, uh\nfiling a lean on a property has been\nbecome a tactic for um entities that may\nnot have rights to bully their way into\ngetting what they want. All we are doing\nhere is adding a penalty so that if\nsomeone does uh file a frivolous lean,\nuh the penalty would be $1,500. in\naddition to attorney's fees and court\nfees. With that, Mr. Speaker, I will\nyield for questions.\n>> You did pretty good. That's how you do\nwith the questions. Rep. Representative\nFenoi to your left is recognized for a\nquestion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the\ngentleman yield?\n>> Yes.\nSo, as a former commercial and\nresidential title examiner, um will this\nbill not only be beneficial to clearing\ntitle, but also uh prevent from\nhindering those who are trying to\npurchase homes from getting homes?\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thank you for the bill. Gentleman has no\nfurther questions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Oh my goodness.\nI've got baby brain. I blame it on my\nwife. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask\nfor your favorable consideration.\n>> We know where you need to be. go take\ncare of mama and all those other\nchildren and a new baby, boy or girl.\n>> All right. Congratulations to you. We\nwish you all the best. Let's say a\nprayer for he and his family and that\nnew child if you will.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered. Is\nthere any objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nbill will vote yes. Those opposed will\nvote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the\nmachine?\nWhat's next?\nHave all members voted?\nAll members voted.\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine? On the\npassage of House Bill 676, the yays are\n165, then days are zero. This bill\nhadn't received a requisite requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption to\nHouse Bill 657 657?\nHouse Bill 657 by Representative Hagen\nand the 156 and others will be entitled\nan act to amend title 37 of the official\ncode of Georgia annotated relating to\nmental health so as to revive for the\nqualifications of recovery community\norganizations for substance use. This\nbill referred to the committee on public\nand community health. That committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass.\nCharity Hagen from Lions, Georgia is\nrecognized to present the bill. Not to\nbe confused with Vaia. It's his own set\nof folks down there in Lions. You're\nrecognized.\n>> Absolutely correct, Mr. Speaker. And\nthank you very much. And I don't know if\ny'all noticed how high this mic was. Rob\nClifton was up here. He is very tall. Um\num members, colleagues, and friends, we\nknow that substance addiction is an\nepidemic in Georgia and in the whole\nUnited States, but also in Georgia, we\nknow that there is hope for many because\nthe recovery community in Georgia is so\nstrong.\nUm, House Bill 657\nprovides consistency of care and quality\nof support for a person or family in\nsubstance abuse recovery by defining\ncertified peer specialists and laying\nout requirements for recovery community\norganizations. And I don't know if y'all\nknew this, but Georgia has the second\nlargest number of RCOs in the nation.\nUm, only behind Texas. And the beauty of\nour recovery community organizations is\ntheir uniqueness. In some states, they\nhave such strict guidelines on the RCOS\nthat they all are the same. But in\nGeorgia, ours are unique. And that is\nimportant because a person who is\nespecially newly in recovery and seeking\nhelp, they need to go somewhere where\nthey feel comfortable. So our RCOs are\nknown to be very specific to their\ncommunity so that they can be as\nsupportive and welcoming to people who\nneed their help as possible. So um all\nof the RCOs in Georgia are supportive of\nthis legislation. Um, it is not a\ndepartment bill, but I have spoken with\nCommissioner Tanner of DBHDD and he's\nalso supportive of this language. It\nprovides quality and consistency, but it\nalso allows for our RCOs to maintain\ntheir individuality. So, Mr. Speaker,\nthat is the bill.\n>> Lady has no questions. Good job.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I ask\nfor your favorable consideration. I\nyield the well. We do have a member who\nsigned up to speak in favor of the bill.\nRepresentative Park Cannon is recognized\nto speak to the bill. Give the lady your\nattention as she enters. Well,\nRepresentative Cannon is recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hi, members. I'm\nhere excited about this bill. I think\nthere's been a lot of thought and\ndiscussion with the community about this\nbill, which is really great. And\nparticularly I'm interested because this\ncould provide improved support for\npregnant and postpartum people with\nsubstance use disorders. This can help\ncreate more clear standards for RCOs and\ncertified peer specialists who really do\nthe behind the scenes work of helping\nensure that pregnant and postpartum\nfamilies receive consistent support at\nvarious times of the day and night,\nindividualized support, and most\nimportantly, evidence-based support that\nis culturally sensitive. You know, often\nfamilies go through different treatments\nafter having a baby and\nare sometimes considered more eligible\nto relapse. After they've had a baby,\ntheir risk of relapsing and overdosing\nis actually higher than even when they\nwere pregnant. And so anything our state\ncan do for better coordination and\ncontinuity of care is a great thing to\ndo for our maternal and infant health\noutcomes. Secondly, I'm excited about us\nrecognizing that medicationass assisted\ntreatment and harm reduction approaches\nwork when you put them together. when\nyou explicitly recognize that there are\nmultiple pathways to recovery which can\nbe medication but a lot of times is harm\nreduction and this bill really looks at\nsome of the best practices around harm\nreduction. Many medical organizations\nconsider Medicaid medicationass assisted\ntreatment as the standard of care. Um,\nand that's typically the standard of\ncare for pregnant patients with opioid\nuse with a disorder in this way because\nit reduces their risk of overdose.\nHowever, it's only best practice when\nit's accompanied with harm reduction,\nwhich means that maybe somebody is using\nagain and maybe they won't get in\ntrouble for using again. And so, not\njust having this almost abstinence\nonlyminded perspective, but truly a harm\nreduction mindset helps encourage people\nget the care that they need in the\npostpartum period. I'm excited about the\ngreater consistency and quality control\nthat peer support service organizations\nhave been working on. I think requiring\na certification through DPH is a good\nidea. It does create training and\nprofessional standards that maternal\nhealth advocates have seen be really\nimportant to have. just simply\nstandardizing training, standardizing\nsome of the social needs in the way that\nwe talk about them, help people with\nparanatal depression, help people with\nbirth trauma that they've experienced,\nand decrease their use for risk for\nsubstance use. Lastly, I just want to\nthank everybody who worked on this\nbecause it's better when we have a\nstronger statewide coordination of our\nrecur recovery resources. And hopefully\nwe will have funding at some point and\nthat funding could help create more\nprograms and reduce some of the service\ngaps that even LGBTQ Georgians have\nspoken to seeing. And for folks in rural\ndistricts, this is important for your\ndistricts, most importantly, who have\nlow levels of obstetric providers or are\nconsidered what March of Dimes would say\nto be in a maternal uh care desert and\nwould allow for some of those\nunderserved families to get the maternal\nrecovery resources they need. I\nencourage everybody to go to support.org\nor and to sign up so that you start to\nget some more information about this.\nAnd thank you. I yield the well.\n>> Ladies yielded the well. She had a\nquestion, but that question was also\nit's not going to be asked. So, we'll\nmove forward. That completes the uh disc\nthe presentation and discussion on House\nBill 657.\nIs there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered? Hearing none,\nthe previous question is ordered. Is any\nobjection to agreeing to the report of\nthe committee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill? Hearing none, the\nreport of the committee is agreed to.\nShall this bill now pass? All in favor\nof the passage of the bill will vote\nyes. All those opposed, no. And Mr.\nClerk will unlock the machine.\nFor what purpose? Cheer lady camp rise.\n>> Parliamentary inquiry.\n>> State inquiry.\n>> Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that when\nindividuals in recovery have the opport\nopportunity and option to work with peer\ncounselors, their rate of recovery is\nhigher because they're dealing with\nindividuals who are actually have\nthey've been where they've been. And I\nappreciate this bill for my community\nbecause we have a wonderful peer-to-peer\nrecovery community organization and\nthey're have success stories every day.\nThank you.\n>> Thank you for making us aware of that.\nFor what purposes representative Barnes\nrise?\n>> Parliamentary inquiry.\n>> State inquiry.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true\nthat this bill will also uh bring\nservices to our youth who are in\nrecovery as well?\n>> Thank you for making that point. I think\nI agree with you as well. That completes\nuh our discussion is and I think we've\nall voted. So, have all members so\nvoted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock\nthe machine? On the passage of House\nBill 657,\nthe yays are 167 and nays are two. This\nbill, having received a requisite\nconstitutional majority, is therefore\npassed. Congratulations,\nMr. Clerk. Will you read the caption of\nHouse Bill 632\n632?\nHouse Bill 632 by Representative Bonner,\nthe 73rd and others being tal of act to\namend chapter 12 of title 43. The\nofficial go to Georgia annotator\nrelating disabled veterans and blind\npersons engaging in pedalling, operating\nbusinesses or practicing professions so\nas to clarify certain veterans\neligibility for exemptions. This bill\nreferred to the committee on regulated\nindustries. That committee recommends\nthat this bill do pass.\n>> I like clarifying.\nChairman Barner is recognized to present\nHouse Bill 632.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 632\nsimply clarifies an existing benefit for\nour disabled veterans uh that makes them\nexempt from the payment of occupational\ntaxes. This bill updates eligible dates\nof service consistent with federal code\nand establishes a formal process through\nthe Georgia Department of Veterans\nServices for this. Again, this simply\nclarifies an existing benefit due our\ndisabled veterans in Georgia. With that,\nMr. Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to take\nany questions.\n>> Uh to your left up front, Whip Park is\nrecognized for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh to the\ngentleman, thank you for the bill. Do\nyou yield?\n>> I do.\n>> On line 55, it increases the physical\ndisability rating from 25 to 30. Is\nthere anybody currently receiving the\nexemption that would lose it by this\nchange?\n>> No. Uh because the uh the VA awards\nthese uh credits in multiples of 10. So\nif someone has a 25% disability, it's\nbasically rounded up to 30.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Representative Carmen Rice to your left.\n>> Thank you.\n>> To your left. Ladies recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the\ngentleman yield?\n>> I do.\n>> Is it not true that House Bill 632 helps\ndisabled veterans build stable lives,\nmaking it easier for them to work and\nstart small businesses?\n>> Absolutely. Well said. Thank you.\nGentleman has no further questions.\n>> All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I\nyield the well and has asked for your\nfavorable consideration.\n>> Gentleman has yielded the well. Is there\nany objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered? Hearing none, the\nprevious question is ordered. Is there\nany objection to agreeing to the report\nof the committee which was favorable\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nHearing none, the report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Shall this bill\nnow pass? All in favor of the passage of\nthe bill. We'll vote yes. All those\nopposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will\nunlock the machine.\nHave all members voted?\nAll members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,\nwill you lock the machine on the passage\nof House Bill 632?\nThe yays are 169, the naysay are zero.\nThis bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional majority is therefore\npassed.\nMr. Clerk, will you read the caption to\nSenate Bill 162 162? Senate Bill 162 by\nSenators Huffstetler to the 52nd and\nothers to be entitled act to amend\narticle one of chapter 34 title 43 of\nthe official go to George annotated\nrelating to Georgia composite medical\nboard so as to provide for the board to\nimplement an automated credentiing\nsystem for healthc care providers in\nthis state. This bill I referred to the\ncommittee on public and community health\nthat committee recommends this bill do\npass by committee substitute. Chair Lady\nCooper is recognized to present Senate\nSenate Bill 162. The lady's recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, ladies and\ngentlemen of the House, uh, I think\nthere's not one single person in this\nchamber that doesn't real does not\nrealize how\n>> will suspend for a moment.\n>> Please continue.\n>> Thank you. I think everybody in this\nchamber realizes how short of doctors we\nare. And one of the problems we have is\nwhen we find a young doctor that wants\nto come or a doctor from another state,\nthey have to find get a license in this\nstate. Then they have to get\ncredentialed at a hospital or wherever\nthey're going to work. And then if they\nwant to uh have Medicaid, they have to\nbe credentialed by the federal\ngovernment. All of this takes time. So\nwhat this bill does as of January the\n1st, 2027,\nit instructs the board to update its\ndata management system and we would have\na one process not for the federal part\nfor Medicaid but at least for getting a\ndoctor his license and credentiing for\nother hospitals. It would allow the\nboard to collect all that data as it is\nlicensing the physician and it would\nalso know what the hospitals wanted for\ncredentiing.\nAnd if they had a special thing that\nthey wanted at a special hospital, then\nthey could add that too. And the board\nwould look at that and be able to give\nthe doctor his license quicker and his\ncredentiing quicker. And that would be a\nmajor concern uh thing, major positive\nthings for Georgia going forth and\ngetting more physicians and getting them\nto where they can practice more quickly.\nThere any questions? I'll be glad to\nyield. Well, if not, I'll ask for your\nfavorable vote.\n>> Leader Hugely to your left, right in\nfront has a question. Ladies recognized.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentle\nlady yield?\n>> I will. Um, can you tell us the\nestimated time of going to this new\nsystem? How fast doctors would be able\nto get their license? I mean, how much\ntime are we saving? I appreciate the\nbill because it is taking too long right\nnow.\n>> Thank you. That is on an individual\nbasis because we have to rely on the\nphysicians to get their when they first\ncome to get their school cred\ncredentials and where they graduated\nfrom medical school and where they did\ntheir residency. And a lot of it has to\ndo with how fast that comes in. But\nusually that's not the hold up. The\nother thing this does is once all that\ninformation is in place, let's say the\ninformation arrived on the 3 of February\nand the board had met on one on the 1 of\nFebruary. This would allow the executive\ndirector of the board to go ahead and\ngive temporary license and let them\nstart working until the board could meet\nto confirm that if everything was in and\neverything met the standard. So there's\nno way to tell but it can take months\nnow for us to get a doctor credentialed.\n>> Mr. Lady yield for another question.\nRepresent Cameron, Representative Mike\nCameron to your right.\n>> Does the gentle lady yield? Will this\nhave any effect on after a doctor's\ncredentialed for a hospital like getting\ncredentiing for a health insurance\ncompany? As I came out of that that area\nand it takes sometimes a long time for\nphysicians to get credentialed.\n>> It should help but that depends on the\nhealth insurance company but it\ndefinitely will on placing them in\nhospitals and I hope that they would use\nthe same information because it will be\ncompiled in one place. Lady has one more\nquestion. Representative Reese on your\nleft in the back.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does Lady Yel?\n>> Yes, I will.\n>> Isn't it true that this bill will help\nus get doctors through the process\nfaster? Hopefully helping some of our\nrural areas where we are in desperate\nneed of healthc care providers.\n>> It certainly will. It's even helping and\nI will tell you that uh our medical\nschool came up with helping us think\nabout doing this because they were\nhaving to get people that have residency\ncredentialed at different hospitals and\nthat was causing a backup of our kids in\nresidency being able to go through their\nrotations and they one of the doctors up\nin Athens came up with this one of the\nfaculty and we are sort of mirroring\nthat. So thank you Mr. Speaker. I will\nyield the well now and ask for your\nfavorable consideration of the Senate\nBill 162.\n>> The lady has yielded the well. Is there\nany objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered? Hearing none, the\nprevious question is ordered. Is there\nany objection to adopting the committee\nsubstitute? Hearing none, the committee\nsubstitute is adopted. Is there any\nobjection agreeing to the report of the\ncommittee which was favorable to the\npassage of the bill?

Is therefore\npassed.\nWe're moving on. Afternoon orders. We're\ngoing to recognize first for afternoon\norders.\nYou'll have a maximum\nmax of two minutes max. See if you can\nbeat it. Chair Lady Camp,\nyou're recognized. Represent Ali, you're\non deck. There will be chair matiac.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of\nthe house.\nBullying and de dehumanizing rhetoric\nhave no place in this chamber, our\nstate, or in this country. As elected\nofficials, we are tasked with the duty\nof doing the people's business and\nrepresenting those who entrusted us with\ntheir votes. Disagreement is expected,\nbut intimidation and dehumanization are\nnot. When individuals are mo labeled or\ntreated less than human, it does real\nharm. It silences voices, erodess trust,\nand weakens our institutions. Words\nmatter, especially rhetoric used by\nthose entrusted with public authority.\nCivility is not weakness. It is\nleadership, and it requires discipline,\nrestraint, respect, even in moments of\ndisagreement. The tone we set here\nshapes the discourse in our communities\nand the conduct we are willing to\ntolerate. If we want a stronger Georgia,\na stronger democracy, we must reject\nbullying in all of its forms and commit\nourselves to civil, respectful\ndiscourse.

Today, Representative\nWilkerson bringing to you a piece of\nbipartisan legislation. In the early\n90s, the state uh the current that law\nthat we elected state school uh our\nlocal school superintendents, but local\ngovernments could have an appointed\nsuperintendent. That changed in 94 and\nwent in effect of all appointed. What we\nbrought to you today is because of a lot\nof constituents have talked to us about\nthe desires to elect a superintendent.\nthose people who are directly\nresponsible for spending so much of the\nlocal monies to education and setting\neducation policy. So what we're\nproposing in this today would be that a\nconstitutional amendment to allow by\nlocal legislation and referendum for\nthose counties that want to have an\nelected school superintendent that they\ncan do so.\n>> Now this would be an option. It would\nnot be mandatory. you would keep your\ncurrent process in place and if you\ndecide to do it in the local community,\nyou could. So, it's giving an option to\nthe local communities that would love to\nsee them electing their superintendent\nas it was years ago. So, if you're\ninterested, please see chairman pal and\nuh or myself.\n>> Appreciate it.\n>> Thanks.\n>> Strong team right there.\n>> We have one more after order.

This has been a very\nhard time for her and her family and she\njust wants to say thank you for all the\nprayers and the messages that she has\nreceived. She hopes that no one else\ngets hurt and hopes that there are\nchanges in Georgia laws for this. As you\nmay remember, Adriana Smith was\npregnant, a nurse, and unfortunately\nsuffered um an issue in her brain and\nwas not able to regain her\nconsciousness. And she remained pregnant\nup until um 20some weeks. And um baby\nChance um was delivered. And baby Chance\nis still fighting for his life.
