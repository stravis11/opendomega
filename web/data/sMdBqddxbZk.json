  "transcript": "Good afternoon everyone.\n>> If I had my gavvel I could get it come\nto order. Buzz.\n>> Good afternoon everyone.\n>> Afternoon.\n>> Good afternoon.\n>> You all\nknow what I know.\n>> A great day to\n>> It's a great day to be a Georgian.\n>> No doubt.\nAnd it is certainly a great day for\nGeorgia's students,\nteachers, and parents in our communities\nall over this state\nbecause Georgia House Republicans are\ndelivering on our commitment to give\nevery student the opportunity to\nsucceed.\nLiteracy, as we all know, is one of the\nkeys to life. The ability to read and\nreceive a quality education opens\ndoorways to opportunities and lifelong\nsuccess. And right now,\nonly one in three Georgia students can\nread at grade level by the end of the\nthird grade.\nLet me repeat that.\nOnly one in three Georgia students can\nread at grade level by the end of the\nthird grade.\nThat's well over 60%\nof our children who are missing out on\none of the most important skills to help\nthem build a brighter future.\nNow, these are the questions I wake up\nat night and ask myself.\nHow many Georgians in our prison system\nwould be leading productive lives if\nthey had learned to read?\n>> Amen.\nHow many Georgians are struggling with\nmental health issues\nif they had learned to read?\nHow many Georgians would be leading\nhappy, healthy, fulfilling lives if they\nhad only\nbeen able to read?\nHere's what I know, too.\nGeorgia. Our Georgia should not be\ntrailing Alabama or Mississippi in any\ncategory.\nBut they're far outpacing us when it\ncomes to literacy. And I congratulate\nthem on their success.\nBut that also means we have a lot of\nwork to do. We must do better.\nAnd I commit to you, we will do better\nbecause the future of our state depends\non it.\nThe time for defi decisive\nbold action is now, not later, when it's\ntoo late for countless students.\nThat's why today,\nright now, the Georgia House is putting\nforward historic education legislation\nthat will facilitate generational change\nfor our children, families, families,\nand our businesses across our state.\nensuring that every child has a chance\nto learn to read.\n[applause]\n>> [applause]\n>> The Georgia Early Literacy Act of 2026\ntakes bold affirm affirmative steps\nforward to strengthen Georgia's literacy\nrates by by investing where it matters\nmost,\nstreamlining guidelines for grade\nplacement, fostering greater\ncollaboration at this district and\nschool level, better preparing Georgia's\nfuture educators, and educating parents\non the critical importance of early\nliteracy and language development.\nFirst,\nwe know that literacy coaches make a\ndifference, not only for students, but\nfor the teachers they support.\nAnd let me be very clear here.\nWe are not in the state we're in because\nof our teachers. They are doing an\nincredible job. but they need additional\nresources. I think we can all agree on\nthat. That's why we're adjusting the QBE\nformula to include funding for a\nliteracy coach in every single K through\nthree elementary school across our great\nstate of Georgia.\n[applause]\nNext, we will streamline the guidelines\nand procedure for great placement for\nGeorgia's earliest learners.\nThis really does not change the age\nstandards already set in place. It\nsimply establishes that kindergarten\nwill be the first step. Most of our\nchildren are already attending\nkindergarten, but some are not. And this\nmeasure will ensure every child\nexperiences the building blocks of a\nkindergarten program before the first\ngrade.\nIn addition, kindergarten and first\ngrade students are shown to be\nsignificantly at risk for reading\ndifficulties by a variety of measures\nincluding first and foremost parental\ninput will repeat the grade that grade\nof learning.\nThis is not a step back. It's a step to\ngive students the best possible chance\nfor success.\nNext, addressing this issue will be an\nall hands-on deck effort.\nSchool systems will be required to adopt\nunified literacy plans, increasing\ncommunity and regional literacy\ncollaboration between teachers,\nadministrators, literacy coaches, and of\ncourse, local leaders. The Georgia Early\nEarly Literacy Act will also engage\nGeorgia's, and this is very important,\nengage Georgia's higher education\ninstitutions that prepare the next\ngeneration of educators to teach in\nclassrooms across Georgia.\nThe Professional Standards Commission\nwill help our educator preparation\nprograms get getting our graduating\nteachers ready to step into the\nclassroom and teach reading from day one\nand evaluate each instit institution's\neducation program every four years.\nFinally,\nwe know that learning doesn't begin the\nfirst time a student steps into the\nclassroom. It begins at birth.\nThat's why the House will propose\nfunding to ensure every single family in\nGeorgia receives a book upon the birth\nof their child so they can begin reading\nto their children from the very\nbeginning. And where it matters most,\nthey will begin that reading. That's at\nhome.\nThis funding will provide for a public\nawareness campaign on the importance of\nlanguage development from pre-birth to\nage five, ensuring our most precious\nresource, our children are prepared to\nbe successful readers.\nThese measures are just the beginning\nthere. We know there will be more to\naccomplish down the road,\nbut the time to do something is long\noverdue.\nGeorgia's children are our future, and\nthey deserve every opportunity to dream\nbig, achieve success, and create a\nbrighter future for themselves.\nI want to thank Chairman Irwin.\nThank you, Chairman D Chairman Dumnick,\nevery member of the House Education\nCommittee and Senator Billy Hickman for\ntheir dedication to Georgia's next\ngeneration of leaders.\nAnd I also would be remiss if I didn't\ndo something else. I may be in trouble\nfor this, but I'm going to do it anyway.\nWe would not be here today without the\npassion and commitment from my wife,\nDale.\n>> [applause]\n[applause]\n>> Dale\nhas inspired each of us to pursue a\npathway to success for every child\nacross this state. Thank you, Dale. Love\nyou very much.\n[applause]\n>> [applause]\n>> told you I was going to do it.\nWith that,\nI'm going to turn it over to a dear\nfriend and a great leader in the\neducation sector who has worked\ntirelessly,\ntraveled endless miles, and had\nconversations\nwith endless number of educators and\nprofessionals and parents\nthat matter most to this discussion. as\nchairman Irwin.\nAfter him will come my dear friend from\nStatesboro Bulock County, Chairman Billy\nHickman. And then we'll call on Chairman\nMatt Dubnick to close us out and we'll\ntake some questions at that point. Thank\nyou for your attention, Chairman Irwin.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. [applause]\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'll tell\nyou, I'm very energized. has been uh\nwhat I'll say years worth of work to get\nto this point with a a lot of friends, a\nlot of experts, um a lot of very\ndedicated groups. I'm energized by the\nfact that I'm looking around the room\nand I see so many educators that change\nlives every day. Let me thank y'all all\nin this room for what you do and and how\nyou assist these [applause]\nchildren.\nBy the way, educators, when I walked in\nmy office, the first song I heard was\nEye of the Tiger from Rocky. So, if that\ntells you I was energized coming in the\nbuilding for this uh event today. Um and\nagain, we could not be here as Mr.\nSpeaker said uh without his wife, but we\ncould not be here without his leadership\nand the things that he has done and the\ndirection he has pushed us. So, Mr.\nSpeaker, thank you for that leadership\nand the guidance that you are providing\nand the assistance you are giving us\nhere. So [applause]\nlet me begin by saying uh reading is\nfoundational to all learning.\nImagine for a moment if you were a\nstudent in college and you could not\nread. We happen to have a very famous\nathlete that has a very good program\nthat had that exact problem. Imagine\nthat and how difficult it would be to be\nin college if you could not read. We\nabsolutely have to tackle this effort.\nThis is the most meaningful and\nimpactful education legislation the\ngeneral assembly has championed since\nthe hope scholarship in 1992.\nstudents across the state will benefit\nfrom the policies included in what we're\ncalling the Georgia Early Literacy Act\nof 2026.\nAnd that will happen for generations to\ncome. And we will look forward to\nworking alongside all of our friends,\nthe the senators, in getting this\nlifechanging\nmeasure across the finish line.\nLet me let me state that to get to this\npoint today has take taken a tremendous\nteam effort.\nI want to start with the fact that we\npassed a bill championed by\nRepresentative Ballard a few years ago\nHB538\nand a big part of this team. I want to\nrecognize her for a minute and her\nefforts in literacy. Thank you,\nRepresentative Ballard,\n[applause]\nfor that great kickoff to get us to this\npoint. I also want to champion a a a\ngood friend of mine and a collaboration\nthat is going to change lives, and\nthat's my relationship and Senator\nHickman's relationship and the working\nof the House and the Senate together to\nhelp and make generational change. So,\nthank you, Senator [applause]\nAnd then lastly, the speaker pointed out\nhis wife, Dale Burns. Let's don't forget\na lifelong educator that has easily seen\nthe passion for education and for\nstudents in this state of Georgia and\nher efforts and guidance and working us\nto this point.\nThank you, Miss Dale Burns. Again, thank\nyou. [applause]\nI will tell you that I feel very\ncomfortable when I have experts like\nDale Burns sitting in the room next to\nme. And what the speaker talked about\nwith those coaches on literacy in the\nclassroom with the teachers right next\ndoor. Those coaches are going to give\nthe same confidence that I get when Miss\nBurns is working with me as those\nteachers are going to get when the\ncoaches standing next to them inside the\nclassroom. So remember, we're going to\nmake some generational change here. Get\nready. Get on board with us. And I would\nsay that if you can't read, we're coming\nto help. Thank you very much. [applause]\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,\nspeaker.\nThis is a great day. You know, this all\nstarted\nin roughly 2002, 2022, excuse me. You\nknow, we knew that our children could\nnot read, but we didn't know that our\nchildren in my bullet county couldn't\nread. We didn't know that my children in\nour Evans County couldn't read. And when\nwe started to tell people in the\nindividual counties what the percentage\nof third graders that were not able to\nread, that's when people started\nlistening to us. And that's when the\ntrain left the station. Thank goodness\nthat we have the vision, the House and\nthe Senate to care about our future and\ncare about the children in the\nclassroom. And obviously, as Mr.\nSpeaker, like you so eloquently said,\nthe teachers, it's not the teachers\nfault by no means. We got teachers get\nblamed, but it's it's just the system's\nfault that we've let this happen to us.\nSo, I want to tell y'all in 2023, as you\nwell know, we passed two major literacy\nbills. One literacy bill created the\nGeorgia Council on Literacy and other\nliteracy bill created the Georgia Early\nLearning Act. Those two bills are what\nspearheaded this whole movement that we\ngot going on today.\nYou, Mr. Speaker, you spoke about\nMississippi and you spoke about Alabama.\nI am so happy that they had the vision\nto do what was right before we did it. I\nam so embarrassed now that the greatest\nstate in the nation, number one in\nbusiness for 12 straight years, have got\nto look at other states as to how they\nhad literacy issues. But you know what?\nWe're doing it and we're happy to do it.\nand we're happy that our team has been\nto these states and reviewed it with\nthem.\nWhat a pleasure it has been to work with\nChairman Irwin and the House team on\nthis on this companion bill that was\ndropped in the House yesterday and\ndropped in the Senate. We are team\neffort on this thing. We're going to see\nit through the line. I look so forward\nto working with the House and Senate\neducation committees and as we further\nreview these and it's going to work\nthrough the legislative process. But as\nthe speaker Elwood said and chairman\nsaid, we going to do what's best for the\nchildren and the students of Georgia.\nThank you. God bless y'all.\n[applause]\nThe speaker used the word bold. Chairman\nIrwin used the phrase generational\nchange. Chairman Hickman talked about\nthe vision. Those are the words that are\ngoing to encompass what we're about to\ndo. This is a life-changing investment\nthat will occur in education. Again, the\nlikes of which we have not seen in\ndecades.\nThis is an absolutely necessary\ninvestment that has to be made. If we\nwait any longer, we will only fall\nfurther behind.\n>> I've heard from many of you, how much is\nthis going to cost? [laughter]\nWe're going to figure that out as the\nprocess continues along. But here's the\nquestion that that I always state.\nYou know, people talk about in business\nthis this idea of ROI.\nAnd we all know what that stands for.\nBut I would challenge you to leave today\nwith a different view of ROI. And that\nis the cost of the risk of ignoring.\n>> Amen.\n>> If we continue to ignore the problem in\nfront of us if we continue to ignore the\ngenerational change that's at our\nfingertips, we're only going to fall\nfurther behind the likes of other\nstates. This is our home. This is our\nresponsibility. We will not shun that.\nWe will not step away from that. We will\nmeet it head on, but it's going to take\nus all. It's going to take our partners\nin the Senate. And I can't tell you\nenough how much I'm thankful for\nChairman Irwin, Chairman Hickman, the\nspeaker, and Miss Dale for us partnering\ntogether to bring us here today. Mr.\nSpeaker, love to take some questions.\n>> Yes, sir.\n>> We have a question or two.\n>> You said it on [laughter]\nOkay.\n>> It's going to be the same pathway we had\nyesterday, right? A couple days ago.\n>> Uh Mr. Speaker, I think there is some\nlegislation so far to uh require uh\nkindergarten enrollment for 5-year-olds\ninstead of the current six-year-olds. Is\nthat part of this plan or is it just\nmore recommended for\n>> You want to address that?\n>> Five.\n>> Yeah.\n>> In the in the legislation, we are not\nchanging the age in which in which a\nchild has to come to school. stays\nSeptember 1st if they turn six by\nSeptember 1st. Uh come to school, but we\nare requiring children to go through the\nkindergarten and kindergarten process to\ngo to first grade.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, chairman.\n>> Can you speak a little bit about some of\nthe results you've had from past\nliteracy projects and how the needs of\nteachers and conversations you've had\nhave helped inform this legislation?\nI don't know if I could hear the\nquestion.\n>> Speak up a little bit louder.\n>> Closer to your mouth. Come on. Lift it.\n>> Little bit louder.\n>> A little louder. Okay.\n>> You've had several efforts for um\nliteracy legislation over the past few\nsessions. Can you talk a little bit\nabout how your conversations with\neducators have helped you helped inform\nwhat needs they might need addressed in\nthis legislation?\n>> If I you want me to, Mr. Speaker? uh if\nI understand your question right, it's\nkind of how we got to this stage and who\nwe involved. We have not only been\nstudying for the last couple years what\nother states around us are doing\nsuccessfully, but we also have visited\nother states um most recently Alabama\nright next door and what they have done\nto increase their efforts. Of course,\nwe're calling in experts in the field.\nWe're discussing with experts about what\nthey are seeing that have been\nsuccessful in changes and that's how we\ngot to this point with our own groups\nbehind us is to build our capacity to\nmake this change\n>> and we've invested literacy coaches in\nrecent course last year we also invested\nin lit literacy coaches and every resa\nin this state to help this process get\nkick started. So this is a continuation\nmore investment.\n>> Uh one question speaker too on the\nliteracy coaches in particular. I know\nyou know before session started you said\nthere was uh you're going to make\nefforts to bring more residencies to\nGeorgia for medical students. Are you\ngoing to do something similar for\nteachers and specifically these literacy\ncoaches to make sure that these needs\nare met uh with personnel? And could you\nalso talk about some of the requirements\nthat these coaches need to have in order\nto get these jobs?\n>> You take part of that. I have\n>> I'm again having a hard time hearing him\nfrom back there.\n>> One more time.\n>> One time.\n>> What are we doing specifically for\nliters coaching?\n>> Is that better?\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay. Awesome. I was just curious about\nhow you're going to make sure that\nyou're able to fill the personnel needs\nfor this increase in literacy coaching\npositions and also some of the\nrequirements that these folks will have\nto have to get these jobs.\n>> That that that's great. Read through the\nbill is what I'd tell you. We got very\nspecific on the qualifications for these\ncoaches that come in, what kind of\nexperience they have to have to be a\nliteracy coach. So we we're very aware\nof what it takes to make this successful\nin a classroom and help a teacher. We're\nrequiring those coaches to have that and\nthen transfer that knowledge they have\nto the teacher and and to work with the\nchild. So that that that part is very\nspecific. I will tell you the number of\ncoaches is going to be vast and we're\ngoing to have to phase that in in time.\nBut as Chairman Dubnik said, we're\ntrying to move as quickly as we possibly\ncan with what we have currently so that\nwe can get it all the way into the\nclassroom as quickly as possible. These\nare not positions we're talking about in\ncoaches that are sitting at a central\noffice somewhere. These are in the\nclassroom side by side to the teacher.\nWe're calling them coaches. That's\nexactly what they are.\nAnd I mentioned in remarks all hands on\ndeck\nwith without higher eds cooperation it\ncan't happen. So we've had conversations\nwith the chancellor with presidents\neveryone I talk to when I speak to them\npresidents of of universities around\nthis state and the deans of the colleges\nof education understand there's an issue\nand they're ready to step up and prepare\ntheir graduates to go to work and fill\nthese positions. So, I think we're going\nto be in a good place. Everyone\nunderstands it's another investment.\n>> Thank you. So, um I know you can't give\nus a budget figure yet. Can you hear me?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um but I'm wondering, you said this is\ngoing to be in QBE, so it'll be funded\nevery year. Part of the formula. Will\nlocal school districts will they have to\ncome up with any money to fund these\npositions?\n>> I'll let you answer that. I'll go I'll\nput my superintendent hat back on that\nthe QBE aotment sheet is given to the\nthe systems. They know that they'll see\nan item with this on it. Uh but you all\nknow that there are expenses when you\nhire employees that the system pays. I'm\ngoing to give you an example. Retirement\nthe system the employer has a retirement\ncontribution to every single um employee\nthey have. So yes, there will be uh cost\nbut it is a smaller\npart of the pie than salary is and\nthat's what QB is going to be picking up\nfor you.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Is it only QB or will there be lottery\nfunding related to this?\n>> You want to do that?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Come on, man. Billy, if you want to\nchime in. Billy, do you have something\nyou want to say? Okay.\n>> One of One of the things that we've\ntalked about is finding a way to make\nthis investment that again that we can't\nignore. And while we're certainly not\nopposed to looking at lottery funds\nright now, we're looking at this as\nbeing a part of our state funding as\nChairman Irwin just said, as part of our\nQBE formula. And so this will be there\nin the budget, baked into the budget,\nsomething that the state is investing\nin. But it would be my sincere hope that\neveryone involved, state and local,\nunderstands that this is an investment\nagain that we cannot ignore.",
