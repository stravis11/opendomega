And in her free\ntime, although I can't imagine how she\nhas any, um, Natasha enjoys cooking,\nhiking, traveling, and spending time\nwith her husband, Corey, and their three\nadult children, Kayla, Malachi, and\nCaleb.\nThank you so much, Pastor Reed. Rice.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Good morning.\n>> Thank you to the senator from the 44th\nand to Mr. president and to all of you\nall for extending this space for me to\njoin you this morning. I must say um in\na personal point of personal privilege\nas a daughter of Georgia from Atlanta\nnow living in Henry County with my roots\nin Snellville, Georgia. This is a great\nhonor. So, thank you all for having me\nwith you today. Um here is a topic and\nI'll be brief. I was told by Mr. Brown I\nhave a little window of time. Um, but\nI'd like us to think and consider this\ntopic. Don't run from the shadows. And\nif I had a subtitle, it would be have\nmore courage than the groundhog.\nAs you all know, yesterday was Groundhog\nDay. And in this frigid environment,\napparently the groundhog saw its shadow\nand ran back into its hole. So, winter\nfor six more weeks. based upon\nPennsylvania Dutch superstition that\nsays that if a groundhog known there as\nPixatani Phil comes out of hibernation\nand sees its shadow and runs back into\nthe hole, then winter will last for\nanother six weeks. And there appears to\nbe some historical connection between\nthe wintertime celebration of the\nGroundhog Day and the ancient Christian\nholiday called Candle Moss. Some of you\nmight be familiar with it. Candle Moss\nis a Christian holiday that commemorates\nthe Virgin Mary presenting Jesus to God.\nSt. stay with me. I'm not going to get\ntoo churchy because I know our audience\nand what it is I'm trying to press us\nforward into. And that's also a day when\npeople would bless candles in churches\nto bring blessings to their households.\nIn the story of Candle Moss, Mary is a\nwitness of what it looks like not to run\nfrom the shadows. Because in spite of\nthe scary environment in which she\nbirthed her son Jesus, the threats\nagainst Jesus's life as a firstborn son,\nshe made her way to the temple, a place\nthat was the central institution in the\nlives of the people to raise light, her\nbaby Jesus, in the midst of darkness,\nand to raise love in the midst of\ndivision. That took courage.\nSo, I've been reflecting quite a bit\nthese days on what courage means. What\ndoes it actually mean beyond concept and\nwhen put into practice?\nHere are a few of the great courageous\nfolks that we know of through history.\nAnd this is what they've said. Winston\nChurchill says, \"Courage is what it\ntakes to stand up and speak. And courage\nis also what it takes to sit down and\nlisten.\"\nMandela says, \"I learned that courage\nwas not the absence of fear, but the\ntriumph over it.\" And Dr. Maya Angelou\nsays that courage is the most important\nimportant of the virtues because without\nit no other virtue can be practiced\nconsistently. She says you can be kind\nand true and fair and generous and just\neven merciful occasionally.\nBut to be that thing time after time you\nhave to have courage. And courage is not\nalways loud but it is never silent.\nCourage can help us to confront evil and\nviolence rather than cower and run from\nthe shadows. And this is the type of\ncourage that calls out evil and demands\nthat it leave. This is the type of\ncourage that I believe that we need in\nthe world today. A courage that stands\non integrity, is imbued with kindness,\nrelies upon honed expertise, has a\ngroundedness and a flat-footedness that\ndeclares just reality in the face of\ninjustice. that declares unity and\ncommunity in the face of divisiveness\nthat declare declares truth in the face\nof lies and love in the face of hate. So\nhow do we those who are serving\ncommunities throughout the state of\nGeorgia embrace this call to courage?\nWell, the first I would put forth as a\nas a howto is to choose curiosity over\nfear. Irish poet James Stevens wrote\nthat curiosity will conquer fear even\nmore than bravery will. With the\ncuriosity that you all approach in your\nparticular representative capacities,\nyou're asking your folks, your\nconstituencies, what are the real\nproblems and then together thinking\nthrough what the real solutions could\nbe. That is the type of curiosity that\npushes us all to stand up in the face of\nthe mountains that we're all facing.\nCuriosity causes us to ask questions,\nhelps us to better understand others,\nthe solutions, the situations, and\ndevelop to develop more innovative\npolicies that can move mountains and\nimpact generations to come. I also think\nthat this call to courage is calling us\nto imagine.\nThe great author Tony Morrison says, \"As\nyou enter positions of trust and power,\nlike the seats you all hold, dream a\nlittle before you think.\" What does it\nlook like to dream? In the midst of all\nthe social media algorithms and all of\nthe to-do list, what would it look like\nif we paused for one moment to dream, to\nthink together, and to imagine? This\ncall to courage to not run from our\nshadows, I believe, calls us into spaces\nwhere we're willing to dream bravely,\nwhere we're willing to dream beyond\npartisan entrenchment, into a place\nwhere we create a reality for all\nGeorgians to thrive. This call to\ncourage is a call to choose the\nprophetic over the partisan. And before\nyou cancel out the prophetic and think\nthat you're not a prophet of old, let's\njust be reminded of what a prophet is. A\nprophet is like an artist who looks at a\nblank canvas and paints a masterpiece. A\nprophet is a homebuilder who looks at\ncommunities that have been neglected and\nsays, \"We can build community here and\nwalls get erected and windows get put in\nand roofs get put upon it.\"\nA prophet is like each one of you when\nyou come into this space and listen to\nall those bills that were read so\nmagnificently fast\nand think about how do we turn that into\npolicies that changed the generations to\ncome in the state of Georgia. That is\nthe work of the prophetic. Old Testament\ntheologian and scholar Walter Bugamman\nsays, \"I think a prophet is someone that\ntries to articulate the world as though\nGod were really active in the world.\" He\nsays that a prophet identifies with some\nclarity and boldness the kinds of\npolitical economic practices that\ncontradict the purposes of God and then\npivot and talk with confidence that God\nis working out an alternative world of\nwell-being and justice and peace and\nsecurity in spite of that contradiction.\nWe are being called to the prophetic\nwork over the partisan work. We are\nbeing called to think about things with\ncourage and cross over divisions and\ndivides because our children are\ndepending upon us to be courageous and\nnot run from our shadows. And when we\nimagine together, we ignite our\ncollective hope. Not a hope that sits on\na shelf, but a hope that is gritty, that\nhas bloodied knuckles, that has grit\nbetween its teeth, that says in spite of\nwhat it may look like, we together can\nbuild a Georgia, can build communities\nthat actually turn into hopeful\nsolutions for generations to come.\nCalled to curious, called to imagine,\nand finally, called to community. And\nhow do we build community in this\nmoment? We have to figure out how to\nlove out loud. Justice is what love look\nis what love looks like in public.\nJustice is what it looks like to love\nneighbor as self. Justice causes us to\nbuild bridges across difference, to have\ncourageous conversations, to push aside\nthe isms, and to figure out what unites\nus more than what divides us. I love\nthis quote from Barbara Brown Taylor who\nsays, \"The only clear line I draw these\ndays is this. When my religion tries to\ncome between me and my neighbor, I will\nalways choose my neighbor because my God\nnever told me to love my religion.\nThe call to community is a call to\nfiguring out the hard stuff, which is\nwhat we're elected, you are elected in\nthis place to do. Figuring out the hard\nstuff, to figure out how we create\nsolutions that benefit our state, our\ncities, and our towns. I'm the child of\na white woman who came to Spellelman\nCollege in 1968.\nShe met my father, a black man from\nSnellville, Georgia, and they fell in\nlove. And in spite of her father's hate\nletter writing campaign, they married.\nThey went on a date after they married.\nMy mother was carrying me in her belly\nat the old Rialto Theater before it\nbecame part of Georgia State. And they\nwere held at gunpoint by a man who did\nnot agree with their love or the fact\nthat she was carrying the fruit of her\nlove. And he held my mother at gunpoint.\nI often say I was held at gunpoint\nthat the love that was produced the the\nfruit that was produced by my parents\nlove was held at gunpoint because of\nracism.\nFortunately, they survived that moment\nand my parents two years later went up\nto see my grandfather who had written\nall of these hateful letters. And I\ntoddled out of the back of this orange\nvan again. I'm dating myself. And ran to\nmy grandmother and jumped and my\ngrandfather and jumped. And all he could\ndo was catch me. And when he did, he\nballed with tears. And from that day\nforward, never said another hateful\nword. Love always wins.\nWhen we love out loud,\nwe become the representatives of what\ncommunity looks like, of what courage\nlooks like, and we're able to dwell in\nthis world house that we've all been\ngiven. Dr. King's final book, Where Do\nWe Go From Here, Chaos or Community? He\nwrites a final chapter that talks about\nthis worldhouse vision. And in it, he\nsays, \"This is the great new problem of\nhumankind. We have inherited a large\nhouse,\na great world house in which we all have\nto live together. Black and white,\nEastern and Westerner, Gentile and Jew,\nCatholic and Protestant, Muslim and\nHindu, a family unduly separated in\nideas and culture and interest, who\nbecause we can never again live apart,\nmust learn somehow to live with each\nother in peace. Don't run from the\nshadows. Won't you join me in a word of\nprayer?\nTo the great one who created each and\nevery one of us in this amazing world to\nlive in and to figure out how to do so\ntogether and in peace. We give you\nthanks this morning. We don't take it\nfor granted that we're here, that we are\nin representative capacities to bring\nforth justice and well-being to our\nstate, our cities, our towns, ultimately\nour nation, and our world. Help us to be\nthe leaders who can lead with courage,\nwith curiosity.\nHelp us to dream and imagine\nwhat it could be if we loved out loud.\nHelp us to figure out how to move the\nmountains before us, the divisions\nbefore us, out of the way that we might\ncreate thriving communities.\nHelp us to listen\nso that in doing so, innovation is\nbirthed, strategies are birthed,\npolicies are birthed\nthat impact positively the generations\nto come. We give you thanks for this\ngreat mantle of responsibility and ask\nthat you might give us the strength and\nthe courage to shepherd them\naccordingly. In your name we pray.\nTogether we all said, \"Amen.\"\n>> Wonderful.\nIt is uh now time to introduce our\ndoctor of the day. It's always nice\nhaving our physicians come down here and\nvolunteer their time.\nAnd to do that, I recognize Senator, a\ngood doctor herself, Senator from uh\nCobb County to introduce our doctor of\nthe day, Cobb County.\nThank you, Mr. President. I'd like for\nyou all to meet Dr. Stephanie Stiglets.\nDr.\nDr. Stiglets is a family physician in my\ndistrict in Marietta with WellStar.\nBut the most exciting thing I think\nabout Dr. Stiglets is she went to\nnursing school first and worked as an\nICU nurse before going to medical school\nat MCG in Augusta. She's dedicated to\npatient center comprehensive care and as\na family physician, she's well equipped\nto take care of any of all y'all that\nhave problems today. So with that, I'll\nintroduce Dr. Stiglet.\n>> All right, come on up.\n>> Thank you, Senator.\nAs a primary care physician, a big part\nof my job is creating long-term\nrelationships with my patients and\nlistening to their concerns, validating\ntheir concerns. Um, I know that a lot of\nthe decisions that are made in this room\nand in this building have a direct\nimpact on my ability to deliver care to\nmy patients. Uh, so with that being\nsaid, I do want to thank you all for\nyour service. Thank you for all that you\ndo for Georgians and I appreciate and\nit's a huge honor to be able to serve as\nyour doctor of the day. So, thank you.\n>> All right. Good job.\nWe have some very special guests here\ntoday that we would like to recognize.\nSecretary will read the resolution.\nSenate resolution 611 by senators Walker\nthe 3rd of the 20th and others. A\nresolution recognizing and commending\nthe Georgia Association of Community\nCare Providers and for other purposes.\nWhereas the Georgia Association of\nCommunity Care Providers represents home\nand community based service providers\nacross the state of Georgia who deliver\ncompassionate highquality care to\nindividuals with disabilities, complex\ncare needs, and aging populations. And\nwhereas these providers serve\ncommunities throughout Georgia with a\nsignificant number operating in\nunderserved and rural areas where access\nto care is limited and community-based\nproviders are often the primary source\nof support for individuals and families.\nNow therefore, be it resolved by the\nSenate that the members of this body\nrecognize and commend the Georgia\nAssociation of Community Care Providers\nand extend best wishes for continued\ngrowth and success. Mr. President, that\ncompletes the order.\n>> Is there objection to the adoption\nresolution?

We're going to find out.\n>> They always say that they always tell me\ntheir worst sales is when they come down\nto the legislature. So, y'all need to\npick your game up a little bit.

A\nresolution recognizing February 3rd,\n2026 as Girl Scout Day at the SC state\ncapital and commending the Girl Scouts\nas a national leader in providing the\nbest leadership development experience\nin the world to American girls and for\nother purposes. Whereas more than a\ncentury ago, native Savanian Juliet\nGordon Lowe started the movement known\nas the Girl Scouts. Whereas the life\nmission of Juliet Gordon Lowe was to\nbuild girls of courage, confidence, and\ncharacter.\nAnd whereas today the Girl Scouts of\nHistoric Georgia and Greater Atlanta\nCouncils serve approximately 43,000 Girl\nScout members in the state of Georgia.\nNow therefore, be it resolved by the\nSenate that the members of this body\nrecognize February 3rd, 2026 as Girl\nScout Day at the state capital and\ncommend the Girl Scouts as a national\nleader in developing girls of courage,\nconfidence, and character. Mr.\nPresident, that completes the order.\nIs there objection to adoption of the\nresolution? Chair hears none and the\nresolution is adopted.\nI'd like to recognize the senator from\nthe 44th to recognize our very special\nguest and speak to the resolution.\nSenator.\n>> Terrific.\n>> Thank you so much, Mr. President. I am\nso excited to have the Girl Scouts. It\nis my favorite day in the state capital\nwhen we have all the Girl Scouts here.\nAnd this year there are a thousand of\nthem um all throughout our halls. And\nthat really warms my heart to see all of\nthese young women um who are going to\ngrow up to be such incredible leaders\nhere in Georgia and beyond. But I have\nto tell you, when I first walked in the\nchamber this morning, I almost had a\nheart attack because there weren't any\ncookies. And I always, you know, we\nalways make sure the Girl Scouts always\nmake sure that there are cookies on our\ndesks. And I walked in and instead of\ncookies, there were like toothbrushes.\nAnd I was like, you know what? We got to\nget rid of these toothbrushes. Please\nbring the sugar that we are all waiting\nfor. Where are the cookies? And I have\nto give credit to the staff because they\ndid that switch. Bye-bye toothbrushes.\nHello, dessert. Um, and there are some\nnew flavors this year. So, I do\nencourage you to, you know, peek around\nat what your neighbors have. Um,\ncolleagues, I've sp had the honor of\nsponsoring this resolution for many\nyears now. And and because in\nparticular, the Girl Scouts were founded\nby\nuh Juliet Gordon Low in Savannah,\nGeorgia, right here in our state in\n1912. We have a special relationship\nwith the Girl Scouts and all of you\nalready know that they are a national\nleader in providing leadership\ndevelopment experiences for girls here\nin the states but even around the world.\nThey run hands-on girl-led girl centered\nlearning focused on STEM, the outdoors\nand entrepreneurship.\nAnd the number of women leaders in our\ncountry, including many of uh myself and\nmany of my our colleagues here in the\nchamber, were Girl Scouts when we were\nyoung.\nThat's right. Center from the 43rd. Um,\nso it's uh it's just such an honor to\nrecognize the great work being done by\nthe Girl Scouts and to commend these\nyoung leaders for what they are doing in\ntheir communities today and what I know\nthey will do once they are adults. Um,\nbut the treat is always getting to hear\nfrom the Girl Scouts themselves. So,\nI'll just introduce our special guests.\nWe have CEO of Girl Scouts of Greater\nAtlanta, Jai Ferrell.\nYes. And we have um Girl Scouts Gloria\nCampbell. And her mother is here, too.\nAlthough Laura, she's in the back, I\nthink. Oh, there she is. There's um Miss\nLaura Campbell. And we also have Sydney\nGirtton Cosy joining us up here at the\npodium. So, I am going to turn it over\nto Miss Gloria Campbell.\n>> All right. Gloria.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hello. My name is Gloria Campbell and\nI'm a Girl Scout from Atlanta, Georgia.\nI've been in Girl Scouts for 7 years.\nAnd some of my favorite things about\nGirl Scouts are the traveling, camping,\nand fun activities I get to do with all\nof my friends in my Girl Scout troop. I\nreally recommend Girl Scouts to anyone\nwho can join because it has fun,\nfriends, adventure, and most\nimportantly, cookies.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Well, I guess I can't come behind\ncookies, but my name's Jai Frell and I'm\nCEO of Girl Scouts of Greater Atlanta.\nI'd be remiss if I don't acknowledge the\nCEO of Greater of Historic Georgia,\nwhich is in that Savannah corridor. Uh,\nwhere are they? They're up there in the\nfront. I mean, up there at the top, we\nhave about a thousand girls here today.\nBut I want to tell you guys, thank you.\nThank you for advocating for our girls.\nUh, the Greater Atlanta Council is over\n35,000 girls in 35 counties throughout\nGeorgia. So, wherever you turn and you\nsee you see a Girl Scout, but you also\nsee a a future leader of courage,\nconfidence, and character. So, again,\nthank you so much. Um, we have some\nthings that are coming up very soon,\nparticularly our license plate tag. So,\nwe look forward to your delicious\nsupport as is the boxes of the cookies\non your table. Thank you.\n>> All right. Good job. [applause]\nAll right, ladies.\nAre there any uh unanimous consents?\nDoes any senator wish to rise on point\nof personal privilege?\nRecognize a senator from the ninth for a\npoint of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. I know we have\nalready acknowledged the Girl Scouts\ntoday, but I want to acknowledge the\nones that are specifically from my\ndistrict in District 9. So, I rise today\nfor a personal point of privilege to\nrecognize Girl Scout Troop 22109,\nthe eighth grade Girl Scouts at Cruz\nMiddle School, and the Girl Scout\nfreshman at Brookwood High School. Are\nyou guys up there at all? Okay, I'm\ngoing to say they're probably out in the\nhall. Being part of the Girl Scouts, as\nwe know, is about more than earning\nbadges. It's about learning. It's about\ncourage. It's about leadership. It's\nabout com confidence. is everything that\nwe would want for any woman that would\nstand in this space as an elected or\notherwise. And it's about understanding\nwhat you will stand for and knowing that\nyour voice matters. Each of you is\nliving through one of the most important\ninfluential stages in your life. These\nare the years when you will discover who\nyou are, what excites you, what you\nbelieve in, and what is possible. But\nchoosing to be part of Girl Scouts, you\nare already doing something powerful.\nYou are showing up. You're trying new\nthings. And you're pushing beyond your\nlimits. As you grow and push beyond your\nlimits, one of the most meaningful\nlessons you will learn is that none of\nthis happens alone. None of what we are\ndoing here today happens alone. One of\nthe greatest strengths of the Gwynet\nCounty Girl Scouts is the community that\nyou build together. The friendships you\nform and the trust you create teach you\nhow to work with others, how to listen,\nand how to lead with empathy. What young\ngirls learn when young girls learn these\nskills early, our democracy becomes\nstronger. As you continue on the path of\nleadership and service, I will leave you\nwith a thought to carry you forward.\nThere are plenty of ways to enter the\npool. The stairs are not one of them.\nAnd with that, Mr. President, I yield a\nwell.\nRecognize Senator from the seventh for a\npoint of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nToday, many are recognizing mental\nhealth parody day here at the Capitol.\nAnd I want to start with something\nsimple.\nMental health is health. That's why in\n2022, this chamber voted for the Mental\nHealth Parody Act. It was understood\nwhat Georgians already knew. When you\nignore mental health, you don't save\nmoney. You just shift the cost. You\nshift it to emergency rooms. You shift\nit to jails. You shift it onto teachers\nand grandparents. And you shift it onto\nkids who can't focus in schools and\nparents who can't sleep at night. Par\nmeans equality. It means mental health\ncare must be treated the same as\nphysical care. It means insurance\ncompanies don't get to play games,\ndenying treatment, delaying care,\ncharging more, or throwing up extra\nbarriers for mental health. But here's\nthe hard truth. A right on paper is not\na right in practice if nobody enforces\nit. Parity without enforcement is just\nhopes and dreams. Because laws don't\nenforce themselves, regulators do. And\nin Georgia, that job belongs to the\ninsurance commissioner, John King. So\ntell So let me tell you about John\nKing's failures. When we passed this law\nto protect Georgia families, we passed\nit to make sure a mom seeking therapy\nafter postpartum depression isn't\ntreated like she's asking for a luxury.\nWe passed it so a teenager with panic\nattacks isn't met with a denial letter\ninstead of care. We passed it so a\nworking dad battling addiction can get\ntreatment before he loses his job, his\nhome, his life. And where was our\ninsurance commissioner? Nowhere.\nFor years, Georgians kept getting\ndenied. Families kept getting slammed\nwith extra requirements. People kept\ngetting told, \"Try again. File another\nform. Wait another month. We don't cover\nthat. We don't cover that provider. We\ndon't cover that level of care.\" And\nwhere was John King?\nHe was lombasted in the news for being\nidle. He said, quote, \"My job is to\nmaintain a stable marketplace for\ninsurance, so we ought to be respectful\nof that because nothing's free. I'm not\ninterested in throwing money or beating\nup on the insurance industry.\" End\nquote. He said his job was to protect\ninsurance companies, not people. Getting\nKing to understand the law has been a\nchallenge because he is not talking with\nmental health advocates or\nprofessionals. Advocates said even his\nown party, Republican legislators said\nKing wasn't enforcing the law. It should\nnot take a newspaper story to force the\ninsurance commissioner to do his job.\nAnd even when John King's hands were\nforced to even when John King's hands\nwere forced to enforce the mental health\nhealth parody law, he refused to to tell\nlast year's insurance study committee\nwho he was actually finding because he\nsaid, quote, \"The biggest offender might\nhave the biggest market share.\" End\nquote. He is protecting insurance\ncompanies, not people. The insurance\ncommissioner finally levied fines last\nmonth. Now, let me be clear. I support\npenalty penalties when companies break\nthe law. But if penalt but if the\npenalty is small compared to what these\ncompanies make off Georgians every year,\nwhat message does that send? Does that\nlower premiums? Does that get people to\ninto treatment faster? Does that stop\nthe next denial letter from landing in\nsomeone's mailbox tomorrow? If the cost\nof breaking the law is just a small fee,\na rounding error, then it's not a\ndeterrent, it's a price tag. I will\nrepeat that again. If the cost of\nbreaking the law is just a small fee, a\nrounding error, it is not a deterrent,\nit is a price tag. And that means\ninsurance companies didn't fail the\nsystem. They played the they played the\nsystem exactly as it was designed.\nBecause when the referee refuses to call\nthis the foul, the fouls keep coming.\nThat's not leadership. That's politics.\nI came to this chamber to fight for\nGeorgia families because I know what\nit's like when people when the system is\nbuilt to tell regular people no and\nbuilt to protect the people with money\nand influence. Mental Health Parity Day\nshould not be a ceremonial moment. It\nshould be a demand. A demand that the\npromise we made in 2022 becomes real in\n2026. Not just in theory. not just in\nheadlines, but in the lived reality of\nGeorgia families. Because par does not\nmean a loophole. It does not mean a\npaperwork maze. It does not mean we'll\nget to it when we feel like it. Par\nmeans equal. Par means now. Par means\nthe law applies to everyone, including\npowerful insurance companies. John King\nhad years to protect Georgians. He chose\ninsurance companies instead. He only\nacted when he was forced to. Georgia\ndeserves an insurance commissioner who\nworks for the people, not a puppet of\nthe insurance companies. Thank you. And\nI yield the well.\n>> Recognize the majority leader.\n>> Mr. President, point of order.\nState your order.\n>> Isn't it ironic or is it not true that\nnone of the Republicans running for\nstatewide office are coming down to this\nwell to give their campaign speeches\nwhile the Democrats want to keep coming\ndown here and wasting our time?\n>> Ah, well,\nthe senator is passionate about what he\nspeaks.\nGot a lot of folks running for statewide\noffices, I tell you.\nSenator from the 36. Are you running for\nstatewide office?\n>> You stay right there. [laughter]\n[gasps]\n>> All right. Recognize Senator from the\n32nd.\nHey colleagues. Um, I'm back again to\ntell you that today is Aerospace and\nDefense Day at the Capitol. As some of\nyou know, I serve on the Georgia Joint\nDefense Commission, and we've discovered\nthat there's more to our military\ninstallations than just the bases. The\nsurrounding communities and defense\nindustries are key players in our\neconomy.\nPlease take the opportunity to stop by\nthe rotunda to see the F-35 simulator\nprovided by Lheed Martin and talk with\none of the pilots.\nI think there are some people from the\naerospace industry in the gallery. If\nso, would you stand up?\nThey may not have made it here yet. In\nany case, Georgia is a leader in\naerospace and I'm proud to welcome this\nindustry to the capital. Please take\nadvantage of the opportunity. Thank you.\nDo I yield the wealth?\n>> All right. Good job. Good job.\n>> Thank you, Senator.\nAnd if you haven't seen that exhibit\ndownstairs, I would I would recommend\ngoing down there. It It is It is really\nneat. That simulator they have down\nthere is pretty neat to get in and\nattempt to fly if you can.\nI recognize the chairman of public\nsafety, Senator from 56, for a point of\npersonal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. It is\nfirefighter day here at your Georgia\ncapital. Always very excited and honored\nto represent my brothers and sisters in\nthe fire service. We have\nrepresentatives here from our fire\nchiefs association, from our\nfirefighters association, as well as\nnumerous other groups that are in the\nbuilding today. Uh you will notice uh on\na lot of the announcements that at 2:30\non the south steps we're going to have\nthe large gathering uh where we'll have\nuh numerous speakers uh and celebrate\nthe great work and the mission of what\nwe do each and every day uh in all your\ncommunities. And as a quick reminder,\nthere are over 900 fire departments in\nour great state of Georgia with over\n30,000 men and women who are serving\neither a full-time, a part-time, or a\nvolunteer capacity to respond in your\nmost critical time of need. Part of our\numbrella of first responders that are\nalways out there serving Georgians. So,\nI'd ask you today as you see\nfirefighters, not just from your\ndistrict, but from all over the state,\nyou take a moment and shake their hand.\nWe thank them for their service to our\ncommunity. And thank you for this Senate\nand the president of our body and\nlieutenant governor for passing so many\npro- firefighter and first responder\npieces of legislation because they know\nthat we have their back. Please give\nthem a round of applause.\nYes, sir.\nThank you, Governor. [applause]\nThank you, Senator. And we do greatly\nappreciate all our firefighters for\nbeing down here today and appreciate\neverything that you do, all the men and\nwomen across the state. So, thank\nyou'all very much.\nRecognize Senator from the 40th for a\npoint of personal privilege.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Mr. President, I rise\nthis morning to talk about health care\nand our young people because you see, I\nhad a constituent who came to me who has\na child who just turned 26 last fall. I\ntoo have a child that turned 26 last\nfall. This is um a critical age because\nat this point our our kids cannot be on\nour health insurance anymore. So\nhopefully by this time they've graduated\nfrom college and they've gotten a job\nand they're able to afford health care\non their own. But it turns out the life\nis pretty tough for our young people who\nare struggling to get along in the\nworld. What happened to my constituent's\nkid is they got they got him signed up\nfor an ACA plan. It was subsidized\nbecause this kid is at the beginning of\nhis career and isn't making a whole lot\nof money yet. All of us were in that\nsame um situation at one point and the\npolicy costs like $106 a month which was\ntotally affordable. But then in mid\nDecember he got a letter saying that the\nrate had gone from $106\nto over $500 a month which meant he\ndidn't have enough money to have the\npolicy. So he ended up becoming\nuninsured.\nThis is somebody's kid.\nAccording to what I've heard, 200,000\npeople who had health insurance last\nyear are now uninsured. So, this was one\nstory, but there are 200,000 other\nstories. When I heard this story, my my\nmy heart fell because I'm like, I wonder\nif my kid got one of those letters. So,\nI immediately got on the phone and my\nchild is is checking on it. Um, but I'm\nworried as a parent. I'm worried. What\ndoes this feel like to a young person\nwho has done all the right things, is\ntrying to still do the right things, and\ncan't afford health insurance, and has\nto just take the risk that nothing bad\nhappens? How do you think this makes\nparents feel who do all the right things\nwhen they raise their kids, teach their\nkids about um financial, how to how to\nhandle finances and and how to get along\nin the world and and then their kid is\nuninsured. And you know that\nyour kid can end up in the hospital and\nin debt for hundreds of thousands of\ndollars, which if the kid can't afford\nto pay that kind of debt, all of a\nsudden it's like all that money that the\nparent has saved for retirement or\nwhatever is at risk because you're going\nto help your kid if your kid's in the\nhospital, right? I mean, this is these\nare heartbreaking stories. Um, and very\nreal stories. And you know, a $250\ntax rebate that's going to buy about two\nweeks of health care,\na homestead exemption, a property tax\nbreak or elimination isn't going to help\nthese kids because they don't own homes.\nAn income tax break isn't going to help\nbecause\nthey're not making that much money. So,\ntheir their tax bill is already either\nzero or next to zero.\nAnd it's Republicans in Washington that\nchose made a decision to not do anything\nto help these young people. You probably\nhave young people in your lives. Maybe\nthey're not old enough to be affected by\nthis. or maybe they're older and they're\nestablished and they have their health\ncare,\nbut it's going to hit you at some point.\nYou're going to have a grandkid who's\nuninsured. It's hit 200,000 people\nalready here in Georgia.\nAnd so I ask you each and every\nindividual in this in your seat, is this\nreally what you want? Thank you, Mr.\nPresident. I yield the well.\nRecognize Senator from 33rd for a point\nof personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President, my fellow\nsenators, colleagues, friends, and\ny'all.\nToday is this month in February is Black\nHistory Month.\nAnd I'm going to start it out with a\nlittle story here, but I want to let\neverybody know in the chamber, all the\nsenators, that you should be receiving\nan email shortly where you can sign up\nto come up and say a few words on black\nhistory.\nToday, I'm going to talk about\nPaul Lawrence Dunbar, born in 1872, the\nson of former slaves. Paul Lawrence\nDunar overcame abject poverty to become\none of the first black poets to achieve\nnational acclaim. The only\nAfrican-American in his high school\nclass, Dunar excelled academically,\nserving as the editor of his high school\nnewspaper and class poet. After\ngraduating, Dunar struggled in his in\npursuit of his dream to become a writer,\npublishing his first book of poems,\nOak and Ivy, in n in 1893\nwith his own money and selling copies to\nthose who\nto those riding the elevator on which he\nworked as an operator.\nrefusing to abandon his passion for\nwriting Dunar Publix's lyrics of love\nlowly life in 1896\na work which pres re received\npositive reviews and served to launch\nDunar's career although most known for\nhis dialect poetry which conveyed the\ncharacter of the black community Dunar\npinned a large body of five literary\nworks including essay, short stories,\nand novels and plays which work to make\nhim the successful poet he is. I thank\nyou very much. That was your Black\nHistory moment brought to you by Senator\nRed. Don't forget Senator Red.\nRecognize Senator from the 22nd for a\npoint of personal privilege.\nThank you, Mr. President. Um, I don't\nknow if I can beat the cookies, but\nwe'll try with our masters hats that are\nhere because today is actually Augusta\nday. Members from Augusta here from our\nleadership Augusta, they'll be here and\nalso um members from Augusta business\ncommunity are also here. So, if you see\nthem in the hallway and they have\nAugusta badge on, please welcome them.\nBut they are responsible for giving you\nthese great hats that people have asked\nfor more, but we only have one per um\nlegislator, so that's all we get. But I\ndo want to recognize I think we have a\ncouple of folks in the gallery. Please\njoin me in recognizing our folks from\nAugusta. If you please stand real quick.\n[applause]\nThank you. And with that, Mr. President,\nI yield the well.\n>> Recognize center for the first.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. And I'll be\nbrief since I'm not running for any\noffice by any means. Uh but maybe I\nshould uh because so much misinformation\nout there and just I want to give the\nbig picture relating to uh health care\nand insurance. If you'll recall recall\neight sessions ago, Governor Kemp's\nfirst bills were the waiver to the ACA.\nAnd guess what? Georgia did a fabulous\njob of this.\nWe have done uh on the ACA a state-based\nexchange\nwhich ensures wow over 700,000 Georgians\nand on the federal poverty level the the\nbelow 100% on our waiver\nwe are used as an example for the rest\nof the nation who have done Medicaid\nexplosion I mean expansion\nyes\nwhat has been done recently on the\nexchange is drop back what was done\nunder the emergency health orders back\nto what President Obama did in\nObamacare.\nThe exact same maybe.1%\nor 2% difference much less than\ninflation.\nSo, let's get our facts straight when it\ncomes to that. Uh, when it comes to the\nexchange, when it comes to health care,\nwhen it comes for insurance, especially\nif you're running for office. Thank you.\nrecognize the senator from 54th.\nThank you, Mr. President. Uh my friends,\na few years back, we did a bill that I\ncarried in this chamber and was very\nproud um to get it passed because of\npassion is a personal passion of mine in\ncivic education and developing of young\npeople. And we passed Senate Bill 220 a\nfew years back that created the Georgia\nCommission on Civics's Education.\nand I was always been so extremely proud\nof that. Well, day in the same light\ntoday we have with us um engaged youth\nin government in Georgia here with us\nand we have or we have some in the\ngallery. If y'all will please stand.\nCould we give them a round of applause?\nMr. President, the this engage youth in\ngovernment. They literally are the\nresult and the purpose same as our\nSenate bill 220 pass we passed. They\nprovide opportunities for students to\nlearn about the positions that serve in\nfederal, state and local municipalities\nfor governor from government governor,\nmayor, council members to police, fire,\nnational security and military. And so\nthey literally are open up doors to\nthese young people. And we're so proud\nof them and we are so proud to have each\nand every one of you. And don't ever\never forget,\nwe're the present.\nYou are the future. God bless each and\nevery one of you. Thank you.\nRecognize Senator from the 36.\nSenator from the 36. Got to get your\nspeech. Don't leave it.\nyou wave.\n>> Senator, I called on you because I know\nyou won't landlast me like the some of\nyour colleagues did yesterday. You know,\nhad friends.\n>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I\nwill take that as an invitation to make\ndaily appearances here down at the well.\nThank you.\nUh I I I I I'd like to take issue with a\ncomment that was made uh earlier uh from\nthis well this morning uh about the\nappropriateness of of of commentary\nthat's shared by senators who take the\nwell for a point of personal privilege\nwhich I'm now doing. And let let's be\nclear about something. The Senate rules\nallow every senator, all 56 of us, time\nto do a point of personal privilege.\nIt doesn't matter if they're running for\nstatewide office or not. We seem to hear\na message from the majority leader that\nthat somehow if you're running for\nstatewide office, if you're running for\nhigher office, you somehow have lost the\nability to speak from the well freely\nabout subject matter that uh that uh\nconcerns you and that you would on with\nand you'd like to share your opinion\nabout it. So, I would just say here's a\ncautionary note. Don't pay any attention\nto when if someone is trying to tell you\nthat your time in the well is not your\ntime in the well, but that it's it's uh\ndictated by an imaginary\nuh caution that was just issued from\nthis very well. that if you're running\nfor higher office, somehow\nthere there's a guard rail that you\ncan't cross uh in talking about an\nissue,\nframing an issue, talking about your\nhistory on the issue, talking about the\nstate of the state uh of Georgia,\ntalking about how federal uh decisions\nimpact what we're seeing going on here\non the ground here around people losing\nuh health insurance and massive numbers.\nSo\nthey can comment, we can comment on any\nissue of interest to them and hope that\nit would be of interest to others within\nearshot.\nAnd uh my friend from the seventh will\nsurely remember\nuh since his first year in the Senate uh\nwhen uh she was a necessary presence in\na study committee chaired by the\nmajority leader and I'm sure the\nmajority leader remembers that well uh\nand the topic which was quite pertinent\nto the duties of the uh department of\ninsurance and the insurance\ncommissioner. So, I just want to stand\nand um loudly proclaim uh the right to\naccess the well to bring messages that\nwe deem as senators to be appropriate uh\nand uh in the interests of the public\nand of the Senate. Uh that is a\ntimehonored timehonored uh privilege\nwhich we have as a member of this body.\nAnd uh I would I would urge you don't\nlet anyone dissuade you from that fact.\nUh that's that's simply the truth of the\nmatter and I wanted to share uh my\nthoughts on that with you today and\nappreciate the privilege of uh points of\npersonal privilege and let us uphold\nthis tradition uh as we go forward.\nThank you so much. I yield the well.\nrecognize Senator from the 34th.\nGood morning, Mr. President, colleagues.\nToday I rise in recognition of Girl\nScout Day. I want to recognize troop\n2489\nfrom Huitt Elementary School in Clayton\nCounty. 36 young ladies consistently\nthink outside the box, especially when\nit comes to serving others. They host uh\nglobe parties, motivate students to\ndonate canned goods and they creativity\nturns giving back things fun and\nimpactive. If uh troop 24089 are in the\nwell, can can they raise their hand?\nNope, they're gone. Well, thank you, Mr.\nPresident. I'll yield the well.\n>> Thank you, Senator. All right. Recognize\nSenator from the 17th.\nHey, I got a topic for you. Come here.\n>> Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nSenators in 2024,\nRepublicans in this chamber voted\nagainst Medicaid expansion.\nYou can call it Affordable Care Act or\nyou could call it Obamacare. I say\nObamacare because he cares. Since that\nvote, over 200,000 Georgian have lost\ntheir health insurance.\nThose aren't statistics.\nThey're hardworking\nfamilies.\nseniors, veterans, and kids. Across\nGeorgia, people are struggling with\nrising costs, especially health care.\nCoverage is slipping away while\npremiums, deductibles, and hospitals\nbills keep climbing.\nToo many Georgians are delaying care,\nrationing medicine, or skipping doctors\naltogether.\nThere is a clear solution. Expand\nMedicaid.\nJust expand Medicaid now. Year after\nyear, we propose real tangible solutions\nto the health crisis. And year after\nyear, the Republicans in this chamber\nblock those bills. Expansion will cover\nhundreds of thousands of Georgians who\nare currently stuck in the coverage gap.\nIt would stabilize hospitals, especially\nin rural communities that are barely\nhanging on.\nInstead, the state relies on a limited\nprogram with strict requirements that\nreaches only a small share of those who\nneed help. That approach leave workers\nuninsured even when they are doing\neverything right.\nAt the same time, federal health\nsubsidies are at risk, which could drive\ncosts even higher for families who\nalready can't afford them. More people\nwill lose coverage unless this\nlegislature act, the Georgia\nlegislature. Medicaid expansion is\nfiscally responsible.\nThe federal government covers the vast\nmajority of the cost, bringing billions\nof dollars back to Georgia. So why\nwouldn't we not expand Medicaid?\nStates that expand Medicaid saw job\ngrowth, stronger local economies, and\nhealthier communities. This is not about\npolitics. It's about whether Georgia can\nsee a doctor when they get sick. No one\nshould die because they do not have\nhealth care when they get sick. And I'm\nnot just advocating for it because I\nhave health issues. It's the right thing\nto do. Democrats are offering solutions.\nIt's time for this body to do the same.\nExpand Medicaid, protect families,\nstrengthen hospitals, and stop forcing\nGeorgians to pay the price for in\naction. Colleagues, we need to expand\nMedicaid now. Just do the right thing\nand expand Medicaid. Thank you, Mr.\nPresident. I yield the well.\nrecognize senator from the 14th.\nThank you, Mr. President. I'm the\nsenator from the 14th and this is a\npoint of personal privilege for North\nFulton County in my district. Uh in\nhonor of Girl Scouts Day, we have\nvisitors here in the gallery from troop\n18224.\nThat's uh from Hannesbridge Middle\nSchool, Autry Mill Bridge, and Mount\nPisca Christian School. And we've got\ntroop leaders Jill Hardison, Melissa\nBllandon, Miranda Wiggleston. Uh, I\nunderstand that the cadets are working\non their democracy for cadetses badge.\nSo, if you could please stand, if you're\nstill here. There they are. Great.\nAwesome. We are so honored to have you\ntoday. And can everybody help me join uh\nthese cadetses from North Fulton County.\nThank you very much.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President.\nrecognized senator from the 55th.\nMy distinguished colleagues, I paused\njust a moment.\nThere are great uh beginnings and right\nnow we want to pause to for today is\nTucker Day. It is 10 years ago that a\nbaby was born and the baby is now. I\npresent the mayor and the people from\nTucker, which you all recognize the good\npeople from Tucker, the city of Tucker,\nGeorgia. This is Tucker Day. Thank you,\nTucker Day. Thank you very kindly.\nVery nice to have the city of Tucker and\ntheir leadership here today. Glad to\nhave each and every one of y'all down\nhere today. So, thank you. Does any\nother senator wish to rise on a point of\npersonal privilege?\nAll right. You have before you a consent\ncalendar of privilege resolutions. Does\nany senator wish to remove resolution\nfrom the consent calendar?\nIs there objection to the adoption of\nthe resolutions on the consent calendar?\nChair hears none. The resolutions on the\nconsent calendar are adopted.\nAre there any motions to withdraw or\ncommit?\nRecognize the majority leader for a\nmotion.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. I move that\nSenate Bill 382 be engrossed.\n>> The majority leaders move that Senate\nBill 382 be engrossed. Secretary, read\nthe caption.\nSenate Bill 382 by Senators Huff Settler\nof the 52nd and others. A bill to be\nentitled an act to amend chapter 5 of\ntitle 48 of the official code of Georgia\nannotated relating to ad valerum\ntaxation of property so as to make the\nstatewide base your homestead exemption\nmandatory for all political subdivisions\nto repeal a related tax bill requirement\nto make conforming changes to amend\narticle 2B of chapter 8 of title 48 the\nofficial code of Georgia annotated\nrelating to special district option\nsales and use tax so as to remove a\ncondition precedent to the call for\nreferendum for such tax to provide for\neffective dates and applicability to\nprovide for related matters to repeal\nconflicting laws and for other purposes\nMr. President, that completes the order.\n>> Majority leader has moved. I see an\nobjection\nfrom the minority leader back there in\nthe back. And a second objection right\nthere.\n[laughter]\nAll right, we'll take it to the boards.\nAll those in favor of the motion will\nvote yay. All oppose, nay. Secretary\nwill unlock the machine.\non the motion to engross the A's are 31\nand the nays are 22. So this motion has\nprevailed.\nMoved on to the rules calendar.\nSecretary Reed, Senate Bill 420.\n>> Senate Bill 420 by Senator Eckles of the\n49th and others.

The Senate Committee\non Economic Development and Tourism\nrecommends that this bill do pass.\n>> Mr. President, that completes the order.\n>> I recognize a senator from the 49th\ndistrict to speak to Senate Bill 420.\nThank you, Mr. President. Uh, good\nmorning, colleagues. I know some of\ny'all are here. When y'all saw SB 420,\nyou got here in a hurry. You thought\nthis was about something uh totally\ndifferent, but uh it's actually about\nfishing this morning. And I'm uh\nbringing this to you at the request of\nGeorgia's saltwater fishing industry.\nWith the support of the DNR, I bring\nbefore you Senate Bill 420. This bill\ncreates an annual reef migratory fish\nendorsement for the Georgia recreational\nfishing fishing license and with\nassociated fees of $10 for residents and\n$20 for non-residents. It also contains\nlanguage authorizing recent actions um\nof our board of natural resources to uh\nenforce their codify their uh rules and\nlaws that they pass their rules that\nthey passed last year. Using funding\ngenerated by this license endorsement,\nthe database of endorsement holders,\nGeorgia DNR can produce more accurate\ncatch estimates for popular species like\nred snapper and king mackerel than\nthey're currently produced by federal\nlaw. For the past several years, Georgia\nanglers have only been allowed to\nharvest red snapper for one maybe two\ndays a year when that species is way\nmore abundant than u than has been\ndocumented by um by the feds. Our\nanglers are consistently losing\nopportunities uh to fish um in our\nneighboring states to the southeast\naround the Gulf of America. They're\nthey're working um with the feds.\nThey've taken over um they've taken over\nthis um into into state hands. And what\nthis bill does is basically a user fee.\nIt's $10. If you want to uh catch red\nsnapper, it's a simple $10. The industry\nwants it. It's pretty rare that an\nindustry comes to you and they say,\n\"Hey, charge us for what we're doing.\"\nUm we they want reliable data. they want\nto uh the\nthat species in particular of red\nsnapper to be managed more appropriately\nthan what it is. Um so with that I ask\nfor your favorable consideration of\nSB420.\nMr. President, I yield for questions.\n>> Chair Rager is the senator from the 42nd\nfor a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Senator yield.\n>> Yes, I yield. Sorry, I was a little late\ngetting in on this one. Um, Senate Bill\n420, I see looks like we're allowing for\nrecreational reefing in this. Is that\ncorrect? Is that something you support?\n>> Rec. Excuse me. Would you repeat that?\n>> It's recreational reefing. Is that\nsomething that you support?\n>> Reef, not reef.\n>> Eer, that's R E F.\n>> Do you further yield,\n>> Senator? I further.\n>> So, what's the difference between\nreefing or reefer and reef?\n>> I don't know. I would yield to the\nsenator from the 42nd. I'm sure he can\nteach a lesson on that.\n>> No more questions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Any other\nquestions? Chair recognizes Senator from\nthe second for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. Mr. President. Senator,\ndo you yield?\n>> Uh, yes, sir.\n>> Uh, Senator, does this bill involve\nanything with moral turpitude? Um,\nunderstanding the previous questions\nthat were asked, could you enlighten us\non that?\nI'll let you and the senator from the\n42nd have a uh conversation about that\noffline.\n>> Thank you, sir.\n>> Any other questions?\n>> Are you a freshman?\n>> Uh yes, sir. Okay.\n>> A few more months.\n>> All right.\nNo more questions, Senator.\n>> Thank you.\n>> Does any other senator wish to speak for\nagainst the measure?\nChair hears none. Is there objection to\nthe previous question being ordered?\nChair hears none and the previous\nquestion is ordered.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which is\nfavorable to the passage of the bill?\nThe chair hears none. The report of the\ncommittee is agreed to. Is there\nobjection to the main question being\nordered? Chair hears none and the main\nquestion is ordered. The question is on\nthe passage of the bill. All those in\nfavor will vote yay. Oppose nay. The\nsecretary will unlock the machine.\nNo, it's not a touch screen. On the\nmotive,\n>> this bill having received the requisite\nconstitutional\nmajority is now passed.\nChair recognizes Senator from the 50th.\n>> Point of order, Mr. President.\n>> What's your point of order?\n>> Isn't it true that because of the\nsenator from the 49th, it's a bad day to\nbe a red snapper in the state of\nGeorgia?\n>> Going to wear them out.

Mr. President, that\ncompletes the order.\nI recognize a senator from the 52nd to\nspeak to Senate Bill 382.\nThank you, Mr. President. We have Senate\nBill 382 before you today. It will\nrestore what the Senate passed by a 427\nvote on February 15, 2024.\nThat was Senate Bill 349.\nTwo years ago, we had seen property\ntaxes being increased on homeowners by\ndoubledigit\nincreases year after year. We saw local\ngovernments increased property taxes by\n80, 90, some over 100% when you looked\nover several years. We had seen local\nschoolboard surpluses increase from 7\nbillion to over 14 billion in the bank\nin the same time frame. And we've heard\nfrom homeowners\nwho say they can't afford the massive\nincreases in their home taxes. They\ncan't afford it anymore.\nAffordability is a word you've heard a\nlot of this year. You've heard a lot of\nit from me for multiple years.\nAnd yet with a billion sitting in the\nbank, we have local governments, mostly\nschool districts, saying they will not\nbe able to pay their bills unless they\ncontinue these double-digit increases.\nAnd they forget that while homeowner\ntaxes can only go up the rate of\ninflation,\nthey can still increase the millage rate\nand that the majority of property which\nis not homeowner property can still go\nup unchecked. This in no way keeps any\ngovernment from getting the revenue they\nneed. I have a long history with caps.\nI helped put a cap on the Floyd County\ntaxpayers from the county commission in\n2002.\nI heard all the horror stories. I\nrefuted them in the press about\nbusinesses were going to leave and they\nwouldn't pay their bills. 24 years\nlater, it still exists. It hasn't slowed\ndown the government at all. As a matter\nof fact, right after that, we got a\ndouble A bond rating, our first ever for\nFloyd County. And many other districts,\nmany of you here have done similar\nmeasures in your communities,\nand\nthey somehow still pay their bills. Um,\nin one of my counties, Barto County,\nafter the school board had opted out, we\nput it on the ballot last November to\nmake it mandatory, as many others here\ndid.\nHaving dealt with 90% tax increases over\nthe past few years, the citizens came\nout for a second vote,\nthis one to make it mandatory, and it\npassed by 90%.\nIn that same election, there was a PSC\nelection. Some people voted one way and\nsome people voted another, but they all\ncame together and voted for this\nmeasure, this simple measure. So, we're\nhere because the original bill got\nchanged on the other side with an opt\nout. And I know many House members over\nthere didn't want that either, including\nthe two that helped us in Barto County,\nthe senator from 37th and me and the the\ntwo House members to put a local measure\non\nUm, so shockingly or not shockingly, 70%\nof the school districts opted out. About\n20% of the cities did. And so here we\nare with the majority of Georgians not\nhaving the protection that others have.\nAnd I looked around the country at other\nstates who have a cap in place. Some for\na while, some recently in Florida,\nTexas, Nebraska, Massachusetts, which\nhas a 2 and a half% cap. South Carolina,\nOklahoma, Arizona, California, Colorado,\nDelaware, Michigan, New York, New\nJersey, Oregon, New Mexico, and Iowa. I\ndidn't see an opt out in any of them.\nThat guts the protection for the\nhomeowner. That means affordability is\ncontinuing to be a major problem.\nNow, there's a second part of the bill,\nand that's the floss penny that came out\nof the House, but we agreed to that.\nthat would allow a penny to apply\ntowards property taxes.\nUm 39 counties put it on the ballot. 90%\nof them passed it this year.\nOne of them said the money doesn't get\nto us quick enough and they didn't like\nthat part of it. So this is going to\naddress that.\nAnd if this passes, it'll be available\nfor all 159 counties and 535 cities. In\nGordon County in my district where it\npassed, the city of Calhoun says they\nwill eliminate their property tax.\nIn fact, the data shows that twothirds\nof the cities in George will be able to\neliminate their property tax. The one\nchange in this bill is to address their\nconcerns, which was legitimate, which is\nto get the money to the citizens\nearlier. The original bill says the\nmoney collected this year will be taken\noff of property taxes next year. The\nchange says that the penny tax collected\nthrough June June 30th of this year and\nany subsequent years will be taken off\nthe taxes in this year. This November,\nthose 34 counties will see in many cases\nhundreds of dollars less on their\nproperty tax bill. So this will correct\nwhat we probably should have done the\noriginal bill and that's to get the\nmoney to the people as soon as possible.\nNow, I did hear one concern that I I did\nwant to address because many people have\nstricter restrictions in Floyd County.\nWe don't have a an inflation. It's it's\nfrozen what it is. Others have\nrestrictions in place very similar\naround the state. And that was like, we\ndon't want to operseed\nwhat we've got. And it doesn't. It\ndoesn't change the original language in\nHouse Bill 581.\nLine 316 says the homestead exemption\nthat is larger or more beneficial for\nthe taxpayer with respect to the\nparticular taxing jurisdiction\njurisdiction\nto which more than one baseear value\nhomestead applies that one will apply.\nSo if you have a better measure in\nplace, it already applies. My county\ndidn't opt out even though they got a\nfreeze because they said we don't have\nto opt out. The law says our freeze\noccurs. Some counties perhaps with\nmisunderstanding opted out thinking they\nneeded to. They didn't need to. Their\ntheir freeze would have stayed in place.\nSo I did want to address that. Um the um\nbill simply restores the original intent\nthat this Senate overwhelmingly passed\nout and gets the floss money to the\ntaxpayer sooner. Mr. Mr. President, I\nurge that we pass this affordability\nbill in a bipartisan matter and I'll\ncertainly yield for any questions. Thank\nyou, Mr. President.\n>> You do have questions, Senator.\nUh chair recognizes the senator from the\n32nd for a question.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chair,\nwould you yield?\n>> Certainly.\nUm, isn't it true that this bill does\nnot affect senior tax exemptions in the\ncounties?\n>> Correct. This has nothing to do with any\nsenior tax exemptions in place. I know\nuh you've got a pretty generous one in\nCobb County as one of your counties and\nI don't know which county you're you're\nreferring to, but it does not affect\nthat at all.\n>> And would you further yield for one\nmore?\n>> Certainly. And Senator, isn't it also\ntrue that this does not affect the sales\ntaxes in the various counties?\n>> It has no effect on the sales tax. I\nthink some people because the House has\na bill that they're looking at that does\naffect the sales tax maybe are getting\nthem confused, but this has no increase\nin sales tax. The only thing that's\nthere is that original penny of floss\nthat they can go before the voters and\nask for.\n>> Thank you, Senator.\nChair recognizes senator from the 37th\nfor a question.\n>> Does senator yield?\n>> Certainly from my good co-senator of\nBarto County.\n>> I appreciate that. Uh, as you know, I\nrepresent not only Barto County but\nparts of Cobb County as well. Um, a big\nissue I'm hearing from my constituents\nis housing affordability and\npredictability and stability. Um, we\nheard some discussion earlier about, you\nknow, cost of insurance going up. Um,\nlots of things are coming at our\nconstituents. Isn't it true this bill\ngives certainty and predictability in\nthe overall cost of your home that\nwouldn't exist without this bill?\n>> Correct. In your in your home, the\nmaximum they can increase it is the rate\nof inflation instead of the assessments\nthat have gone up sometimes $100,000 on\nhomes and people get massive tax\nincreases that they didn't budget for.\nAnd in many cases with some of the\nseniors um they um are on fixed incomes\nand it's certainly affecting their\nability to stay in their home. Does\ngentleman further you\n>> certainly um I represent a county that's\ngot a a large school district. Um you\nknow our school district's budgets\nround about a billion dollars in scale\nand scope in Cobb County. We've got more\nthan 100,000 students. Um I talked to my\nschool district. Um this is going to\nhave an impact on revenue on our school\ndistrict. um per year potentially $14\nmillion. Um\nbut isn't it true that relative to a\nbillion dollar budget, a 14 mill if you\nhave a billion dollar budget, you have a\n$14 million fiscal impact, isn't that a\nrelatively low fiscal impact for a\nschool district that scale when you\nbalance that against the impact it has\nof predictability and stability for\nhomeowners?\n>> It is. We we've seen that in in Floyd\nCounty where we've had the free zone\nsince 2002. It's not that big of an\nimpact. Um in addition, all the property\nother than home owners which still goes\nup the rate of inflation. It just\ndoesn't go up more than inflation. All\nthe other property is unchecked and\nthere is a millage rate though u I found\na lot of them would much rather have a\nbackdoor tax increase than raise the\nmillage rate.\n>> Does general yield for one further\nquestion?\n>> Certainly. Um, so as a as a lawmaker\nfrom a constituency such as ours, if\nwe've got a very strong commercial base,\nis as Cobb County does, there's a very\nstrong commercial tax base. Um, that's\ngoing to continue to grow in a very\nhealthy way. This really only limits the\ncosts on homeowners. So conceivably if\nour commercial digest continues to grow\nin a healthy way, there may be almost\na very very little fiscal impact, but\nit's really only businesses that are\ncovering that and commercial entities,\nbut homeowners are locked in kind of\nkept kept stable.\n>> I certainly think the senator from 37\nknows of which he speaks.\n>> Appreciate the bill. Thank you, sir.\n>> No further questions, Senator.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. And I urge\nyour yes vote on this bill.\nChair recognizes the senator from the\n44th to speak to the measure.\nThank you, Mr. President. Um, this\nlegislation has a lot of great things in\nit and um, certainly it's a\nwell-intentioned effort to help with the\naffordability crisis so many of our\nfamilies are feeling in feeling in many,\nmany different aspects of their lives.\nUm,\none concern I have that I know has been\nexpressed to me and maybe to some of the\nrest of you by my by my constituents\nis that a one-sizefits-all\nis potentially not a great policy for a\nstate with 159 counties that are so\ndesperate in their population, in their\nmedian income, whether they're even\nurban or rural.\nWe have school systems in widely\ndifferent states of fiscal solveny as\nwas made extremely clear this year with\nthe the uh situation some of our school\nsystem districts found themselves in.\nJust to point out that they're all not\nsimilarly situated and having sort of\nmore um\nincreased state control because that's\nwhat it is. It's increased state control\nsaying you must do this when we've got\n159 counties and almost uh well actually\neven potentially a few more than that on\nthe school systems don't have that\nnumber right at the uh tip of my tongue\num to sort of say\nwe are going to impose on you dually\nelected\nschool boards dually elected local\ngovernments a one-sizefits-all. I do\nthink that, you know, is something that\nwe should think about carefully because\nthe moment we're in now is not\nnecessarily the situation or the moment\nthat we will always be in. And when you\ntie hands, remove flexibility, things\nmay not work out as well as we would\nhope in the present moment.\nOur counties have widely variant\neconomic conditions. So, it really is\nnot, in addition to not being\nparticularly\nsmart policy-wise to demand a blanket\ncondition, it also isn't necessarily\neven practical or equitable.\nAnd it does tie our local officials\nhands\num in terms of how they can deal with\ntheir own budgets and provide the fiscal\naccountability that they are tasked with\nproviding for their constituents by\nvirtue of their own dyeleed positions.\nSo that is um my main concern about the\nnotion of a one-sizefits-all.\nAlso, I I think it bears um\nrepeating, you know, how we got here\nbecause this is sort of a this is a very\nspeedy uh retread of a subject that we\nonly dealt with two years ago.\nSo, we had a constitutional amendment on\nthis uh this exact topic.\nIt was a compromised piece of\nlegislation that went before the voters\num between uh legislators here in the\nbuilding, between Democrats, between\nRepublicans and by all the leaders um in\nthis in this building and across the\nstate across the state. And 65% of\nGeorgians cast that vote based on what\nwas being presented to them at the time\nwith the ballot language.\nAnd now,\nbut before anyone can catch a breath,\ntwo years later, we're coming back to do\na little bit of a bait and switch\nbecause this is quite different than the\nenabling legislation that was present at\nthe time that we presented this to the\nvoters.\nSo I think from the perspective of what\nwe have done from a constitutional\nstandpoint, we should be cautious in so\nswiftly undoing the bargain that was\npresented to the voters a mere two years\nago.\nAnd we all wish that\num dealing with\ndoing an inflationary cap restriction on\nproperty taxes would be a big step\ntowards solving our housing\naffordability crisis. But the reality is\nit just won't be. We have got to deal\nwith the housing affordability crisis by\nbuilding more homes. We do not have\nenough supply. We've got to stop\ninstitutional investors\nand and we need to have local\ngovernments\nbe a we need local governments to permit\nhousing more housing projects. And that\nis something that where there's\nlegislation pending\nI know in the house and I believe also\nover here legislation called the choice\nact that would go much farther towards\nactually leading to housing\naffordability\nin the supply and demand of economics in\nour state. This is much more of a\ntalking point. Oh, we did something. But\nbut the something being done can have a\nlot of effects that certainly just don't\naren't equitable and don't work for 159\ndifferent counties, 180, I remember the\nnumber, 180 school systems. Um, so\nmeanwhile, we should really be focusing\non like real solutions that are going to\ncut out a lot of the red tape that we\ncurrently have with the that leads to\nthe lack of building that we really need\nto see. we really need to see a lot more\nbuild baby build and this just isn't\ngoing to get the job done. So let's not\nkid ourselves that that this will result\num in anything that's going to make a\nmeaningful difference in housing\naffordability. So um with that, Mr.\nPresident, happy to answer any questions\nor I shall take my seat.\n>> You do have questions, Senator. Um\n>> thank you, Mr. President.\n>> Chair recognized Senator from the 36.\n>> Thank you. Does the senator yield? Yes.\nTo the Senator from\n>> Senator. Um we I believe represent uh\nthe families with children in Atlanta\nschools. You on the Dicab County side\nand I on the Fulton side. Um, and isn't\nit true that uh our school system in\nAtlanta, which is one of the uh two\nlargest school systems in the state, I\nwould I would argue, uh has had to uh\nconduct a a tremendous uh assessment of\nhow many schools can continue to be\nopened. Isn't that correct?\n>> That is correct. Yes. and and we've se\nand we've seen uh\nvery close to where you live, close to\nwhere I live, we've seen schools\nshuttered uh in the plan that that the\nschool board in its wisdom has had to\ndevise uh to uh make the make the uh\nfinances work. Isn't that true?\n>> That is true. And uh a further question\nisn't it true and you may not be aware\nof this given that we are in in\ndifferent counties but in the county of\nuh Fulton our commercial assessment\nrevenues that are produced uh are lower\n>> than a year ago. That's right. That's\nright.\n>> Yeah. The digest fell. So, how much uh\nhow much do we want to hobble uh public\neducation? Just uh how far should we go\nin in in that regard? Uh and doesn't\nthis don't this doesn't this set of\nfacts lend itself to a uh the wisdom of\na decision to vote no on this bill?\nYou make some great points, Senator, and\nthere are actually a number of other\nschool systems in my district and I'm\nsure many of our colleagues that are in\nthe same position with falling\nenrollment and they're having to make\ntough decisions. And um I think that it\nit just goes to show how not all\ncounties are similarly situated. And\nwith the falling digest,\nyou know, we've had a a digest that's\ngone way up. And part of that is because\nof the lack of supply, but there are\nmarket forces at work. And and you point\nthat out by saying Fulton's Digest has\nactually gone down now. And it won't be\nthe only one, and it won't be the only\ntime. And so when you're in a a period\nwhere where housing prices are falling,\nthat's the market correcting. And how\nmuch do we really want to interfere with\nsome of these free market forces that\nare important for funding services? So I\nagree with you, Senator. Thank you very\nmuch.\n>> No further questions.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the\nwell.\n>> Chair recognized the senator from the\n31st to speak to the measure.\n[clears throat]\nThank you, Mr. President. I rise today\nto address a fundamental disconnect\nbetween the rhetoric we hear from our\ncolleagues across the aisle and their\nactual voting record when it comes to\nthe financial well-being of Georgia\nfamilies.\nEvery day in this chamber, we hear about\npassionate speeches about affordability,\nabout the cost of living, about helping\nworking families and meet.\nWhen yet presented with the opportunity\nto return hardearned money to Georgia\ntaxpayers through meaningful property\ntax relief,\nthose same voices fall silent. Their\nvotes tell the real story. A story of a\npolitical philosophy that rather see\ngovernment grow than see Georgians\nfulfill the American dream.\nMy colleagues on the other side of the\naisle work every day and talk about\naffordability.\nThey express concern about rising costs.\nThey speak very eloquently about the\nstruggles of working families.\nThey vote to maintain a system where\nlocal governments fe no face no\nmeaningful constraints\non their ability to burden homeowners\nwith everinccreasing tax bills.\nThis is not mere hypocrisy. It\nrepresents the fundamental\nmisunderstanding of what affordability\nactually means to Georgia families.\nhigh property taxes that do not pay a\nfamily for the cost that they cannot\nbudget for at home. When the air\nconditioner breaks in July, when the car\nneeds unexpected repairs, when medical\nbills arrive, property taxes just don't\ndownward accommodate these realities.\nInstead, they represent an inflexible,\never growing obligation that families\nmust meet regardless of their\ncircumstances.\n[snorts]\nHome ownership has become been\nconsidered the cornerstone of the\nAmerican dream. Yet, property taxation\nrepresents something more insidious.\nIt's a tax on the dream itself.\nIndeed, it's the very essence of the\ncradle to grave government\nto require citizens to continue paying\nrent to the government for as long as\nthey own their home.\nYou purchase a home, you pay your\nmortgage, you maintain your property,\nyou invest in your community, and yet\nyou truly never own it because failure\nto pay your property taxes and the\ngovernment will come take it from you.\nThis is not ownership in any meaningful\nsense. It's a perpetual tendency with\nthe government as your landlord.\nRonald Reagan understood this principle\ndeeply as a governor of California and\nlater as president. In the late 1970s as\ngovernor, he witnessed firsthand the\nproperty tax crisis devastating\nCalifornia property owners. Property\nassessments were skyrocketing and in\nsome cases doubling and tripling within\njust a few years.\nSenior citizens who had paid off their\nmortgages decades earlier were being\nforced from their homes because they\ncould not afford tax bills.\nYoung families were locked out of home\nhome ownership entirely.\nThe crisis reached peak in 1978 with the\npatches of Proposition 13, the landmark\ninitiative that pro that cap property\ntaxes and limited assessment increases.\nGovernor Reagan was an enthusiastic\nsupporter and he declared that quote the\npeople had spoken the era of tax and tax\nand spend and spend is over. But\nReagan's support wasn't just a political\ncalculation. and it reflected his deep\npolitical and philosophical conviction\nabout the property relationship between\nthe citizens and their government. He\nunderstood that when the government\ncould seize your home for failure to pay\nfor every increase in taxes on your home\nyou already owned, you weren't truly\nfree. You were a tenant of the state.\nThis understanding only deepened went\ndeeper during Reagan's presidency. this\nrelationship between taxation, freedom,\nprosperity that Democrats today don't\nunderstand and they can't sell it.\nGeorgia Senate Democrats believe that\njust like Reagan said, quote, \"Gover's\nview of the economy could be summed up\nin just a few simple words. If it moves,\ntax it. If it moves, if it keeps moving,\nmove, regulate it. And if it stops\nmoving, subsidize it.\" This is a\ndevastating critique of the progressive\nphilosophy that sees government as the\nengine of prosperity rather than pe than\nthe people themselves that are in South\nGeorgia or inner city Atlanta or right\ndown the street from here. High taxation\nis not an economic problem. It's a moral\none. Every taxpayer is involuntarily\nworking on the part of of their\ngovernment. The question is how much can\nyour labor, your time in your life does\nthe government have a right to claim?\nTaxation represents a fundamental\ntransfer of decision-making power from\nindividuals to bureaucrats.\nWhen government can claim an unlimited\nshare of your income or your unlimited\nportion of your property's value through\ntaxation,\nyou are not free. You're a subject and\nnot a citizen.\nThis is the vision that we must apply to\nthe property taxation in Georgia today.\nLocal governments have grown beyond\nconsent of the governed. They have\nincreased their taxpayers not through\nexplicit voter approval but through the\npassive mechanisms of rising\nassessments. They have expanded expanded\nspending to match inflated revenues than\nproviding relief to the taxpayer.\nAnd now some resist limitation on their\npower to continue this pattern\nindefinitely.\nReagan once warned us about this\nrhetoric that we would hear from those\noppo that oppose tax relief. He said the\nmost terrifying words in the English\nlanguage. I'm from the government and\nI'm here to help. When local governments\ntell us you need unlimited access to\nproperty values to quote unquote help\nthe community. Remember what Ronald\nReagan warned when they claim that\nlimiting taxes will devastate essential\nservices. Ask yourself, did they provide\nproportionately better services when the\nrevenue was doubled?\nRepublicans focus on affordability and\nthat requires government committed to\ndoing more with less. We believe that\nGeorgia families, not the government\nbureaucrats, are best positioned to\ndecide how their money is spent. We\nbelieve that home ownership should\nachieve truly achieve sustainability and\nnot contingent on the government's\nrestraint and raising taxes.\nWe believe local governments like\nfamilies should live within their means\nand make hard choices about provide\npriorities rather than simply raising\ntaxes to to increase revenue. The\nproperty tax relief measure that is\nbefore this body represents these\nprinciples in action. It provides\nmeaningful constraints on automatic tax\nincreases while still allowing local\ngovernments to make their case to the\nvoters when additional revenue is truly\nnecessary. It respects the needs of\nlocal government and the rights of\ntaxpayers and homeowners. Mr. President,\nthe choice before this body is very\nclear. We can continue down the path of\nan everexpanding government funded by\neverinccreasing taxes on Georgia\nhomeowners. We can allow the American\ndream of home ownership to become the\nelusive province of Wall Street\ninvestors while working families are\npriced out in their own communities. Or\nwe could choose the path of fiscal\nresponsibility, limited government, and\nrespect for the homeowner and the\ntaxpayer. We can insist that government\nat every level can learn to do more with\nless, just as everyday Georgia families\nhave to do. My colleagues across the\naisle speak eloquently about\naffordability.\nIt's time for their votes to match their\nrhetoric. It's time to give\nGeorgiaorgians their hardearned money\nback. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield\nthe well.\n>> You do have a question, Senator.\nSenator's yielded the well.\nChair recognizes the senator from the\n47th to speak to the measure.\nWell, thank you, Mr. President. I think\nall my colleagues in here know how much\nI hate coming to the well talking about\nlegislation and what we're doing, but I\nwant to tell you I said the for me it's\na little bit different. Most of y'all in\nhere know that I I spent 20 years as as\na 10 as a city manager, 10 as a county\nmanager. I've also run two development\nauthorities for another decade.\nProbably more than than most people. The\nuh I understand a little bit about uh\ntaxes, what's going on. And you know,\nfor me, I agree with with uh the senator\nfrom the 52nd, you know, when we we talk\nabout what's going on with people\nneeding relief. They've got to have some\nhelp. You know, I always felt like, wait\na minute, do I own my home? I I paid off\nmy mortgage. Luckily, I'm I'm old enough\nto do that. The uh but I get to pay the\nuh government all the time. Now, I'm not\nagainst po uh paying the government.\nSaid the and in this case, you know, the\nbest part about when I pay my local tax\nbill, it's all local. It's people that I\nget to see in the grocery stores, people\nthat that uh are leaders in my community\nthat that are setting my tax rate. But,\nyou know, unfortunately, they've got a\njob to do, and they some of them have\nvery limited capacity to where they can\ncollect money. So, to me, the more that\nI look at it, the more I look at I said,\n\"Okay, there's got to be a way to make\nthis work.\" The uh I hate it that that\nuh I feel like I do pay rent on the\nproperty that I've paid for uh to my\nlocal government, but I'm glad it all\nstays local. You know, one of the things\nI've said and and believe me, I've I've\ndone about all the things you can do on\nthe local side of the the government,\nthe uh I've been lucky enough to be able\nto serve in the state senate and you\nknow, I understand a lot better about\nthe state budget and what's going on.\nOne of the things that I'm really proud\nof what's going on in Washington DC and\nwhat's going on in AC all across America\nbecause we have a relationship with not\nonly the local government, the state\ngovernment, and the federal government\nand we've got to do what's right the uh\nfor all our citizens. I guarantee you\nevery one of your constituents is paying\ntaxes to a city or a county or both and\nyou can't get away with that. Said\nthey're also my constituents. Uh and to\nme we live in a great country. It's one\nof those things. Taxes are a necessary\nevil. Now, I want to share with you and\nand it's one of those things that for\nme,\nI don't know, some of y'all read read\nall the emails that come to you. I I try\nto read every email that I get, and I\nhad a constituent send me an email\nSunday. I was reading it. The uh\nunfortunately, he he attached a a word\ndocument. Then I don't just open a word\ndocument from somebody I don't know. So\nI texted him back or emailed him back\nand said, \"Hey, would you send that to\nme so that I can read it without opening\nup on a thing just because we live in a\nvirus field world?\" Pretty sad state of\nthings. But this this uh email was from\ninvestigator Sean Allen Parton. They uh\nhe's a constituent of mine, lives over\noutside of Comr, Georgia. they uh you\nknow he goes on and and it's it's kind\nof a lengthy the uh four-page document.\nThey uh but he goes on and tells me a\nlittle bit about him and and what's\ngoing on in his world. He talked about\nin and uh uh he always wanted to be in\nlaw enforcement. He said the his first\nexperience there was he was a ranger at\nStone Mountain Park. They uh eventually\nhe went to work for Newton County\nactually as a ditch digger. Worked in\ntheir their water uh system. the uh from\nthere he got an opportunity in Okone\nCounty to to be a jailer the uh for the\nsheriff uh back in 2000. He went on to\nthe uh police academy, graduated and\nbecame a sheriff's deputy the uh there\nin in Okon County for several years.\nFast forward today, he's an investigator\nfor the Jackson County Solicitor\nGeneral's Office. Reason I bring you\nthis is but not because of him but\nbecause we all have our lives. And to\nme, one of the things that that he goes\non to talk about is his daughter Briana.\nHis his daughter he he he got a uh phone\ncall from\none of the medics in the fire department\nthat said they uh uh they they received\na call from his granddaughter. They uh\nshe was six. They uh\nmy mom's unresponsive. What? I don't\nknow what to do. My mom can't do\nanything. She's she had and and I'm\ngoing to share this cuz he told me I\ncould. They uh he said that that uh his\ndaughter was hypoglycemic. Any of y'all\nthat are that are diabetics and know\nwhat that means? They you go into shock\nin that case. They had all the right\nthings to try to address that, but\nunfortunately the technology failed. And\nso for me, his daughter suffered with\nthe fact that she's she's now uh fully\nbedridden. She has to be cared for 24\nhours a day. And and he has her his home\nwhich he built in Madison County a few\nyears ago. And I'm going to read this to\nyou because this is the important part\nof the letter.\nOur rainy day fund couldn't hold up to\nthe disastrous storm we are facing and\ndwindled overnight.\nany and available savings we had had\nbeen spent. The money set aside for our\nproperty taxes now have to make a\nchoice.\nUse the last bit of savings we have to\npay my property taxes\nwhich will save me from losing my home\nor keep the last bit of savings we have\nleft held back to pay for funeral\nexpenses for my daughter.\nThis is an impossible choice we have to\nmake. And this is the kind of choice\nthat our everyday citizens are looking\nat. They uh nobody has a crystal ball.\nOnly God can tell how long his daughter\nwill live. But he goes on in the letter\nto say, \"My tax bill was due 12205.\nI've already received letters from the\ncounty threatening action regarding my\n30-day delinquency.\nTaxes are real. I understand the need\nfor taxes. I think everybody in here\ndoes.\nTo me, we want to make them as as plain\nand simple as we can be. Doing something\nlike passing this measure that Senator\nfrom the 52nd has brought to us is going\nto do that. And this is where I'll ask\nyou to vote favorably on the measure to\nto let make sure that every one of our\nGeorgia citizens understands we feel\ntheir pain. We know what's going on and\nwe want to try to make it as open and\nhonest as we can. Thanks for your time.\nThe I'll yield the well.\nChair recognizes the senator from the\n54th to speak to the bill.\nThank you, Mr. President. Um, my\nfriends, I uh\nyou hear these kind of things go back\nand forth and you just think, who are we\nworking for?\nBecause, you know, all we're the the\npurpose of this is, you know, in the\n1980s\nwhen I graduated high school in 1982,\nthe average age of a firsttime homeowner\nwas in their 20s.\nBy the time we got to the year 2000, now\nit's in the early 30s.\nYou know what's the average age of\nfirsttime home home ownership is in\nGeorgia right now? It's 40 years old.\n40 years old. Because first time, my son\nis one of those\nfirst time young people just starting\nout, maybe as a new married couple. They\ncan't afford\nwhat's happening in the inflation of our\nhome market\nfor that first time starting out. Then\non the other end, you have the elderly.\nI mean, we are literally have been when\nthe times got tough a couple years ago.\nWe're literally watching elderly people\nwho get these. They might have bought\nthe house. An a couple bought a house in\n1979.\nThey didn't never move.\nThey grew old in that house. They grew\nhad their grandkids in that house. Now\nyou've got one of them has passed on.\nSo now there's a single widow\nwho still lives in that house that they\nbought with a modest means years ago,\nbut now they get a property tax\nassessment that says their home is worth\n$400 to $500,000.\nThat elderly person has but one option.\nI've got to sell my house.\nI've got to move out.\nForget the grandkids getting to keep the\nproperty.\nForget forget to keep the property that\nwas in our in our namesake. Forget all\nthat. It's got to go because I I got to\nhave somewhere to live. And the\ngovernment that says they're going to\ntake care of me is literally the one\nthat's putting me out of my home.\nThat's what this is about. We're not\ntrying to\nrailroad something through. We're just\ntrying to make sure we're taking care of\nthose on the front end and those on the\nback end with home ownership\nbecause I'm sorry, but you know, when\nyou can't take care of those who are in\nneed of care,\nthat says a whole lot about a society.\nSays a whole lot about society that\nwon't care for those who need care.\nAnd when we're not doing everything we\ncan to make sure that future generations\nhave access to home ownership because\nthat was the quintessential American\ndream. That was the cornerstone of the\nAmerican dream was home ownership.\nNow you have to wait till you're 40\nyears old in 2025\nto get access to that American dream.\nThat's all this is about.\nSo, let's just make sure that we're\ndoing everything we can to cap the ones\nthat are out of control. That's all this\nwas ever about is making sure that we're\nnot There are some entities that they\nliterally Let's Let's be honest, there\nare some communities they were going to\nput local ordinances in place for home\nnew home development.\nAnd by the time they put those new\nordinances in place for that new home\ndevelopment, we're talking about half\nmillion dollar homes.\nSo they're literally assessing these\nproperties so high that that\nthey're going to drive off the people in\nthe middle class.\nThey're going to drive off those people\nwho can't afford that first time home.\nAll we're doing is trying to make sure\nthat we're keeping the field the playing\nfield fair for both the young and the\nold and everybody in between. That's all\nthis bill does.\nSo I would encourage everyone to please\nvote for this. Let's help those on the\nyoung those young people that are first\ntry homeowners and let's he help the\nelderly keep the homestead that they've\nhad in their home for maybe 60 years\nand not have to have a widow woman have\nto give up her her family's home because\nshe can't afford the tax man's bill. Mr.\nPresident, I I yield well. Thank you.\nChair recognizes a senator from the\nsecond to speak to the bill.\nNice sports coat. I like it. Well, thank\nyou, Mr. President. and I\ndid not plan to take to the well today,\nbut since my colleagues have talked\nabout the issues with affordability and\nfolks owning a home, I want to talk\nabout the folks that can't even buy a\nhome. I want to talk about the state\nminimum wage in the state of Georgia\nthat's $5.15.\nI want to talk about the corporate\nwelfare that we hand out. I want to talk\nabout how we've cut the corporate income\ntax rate before we've cut the personal\nincome tax rate if we were serious about\nit. I want to talk about the cost of\nliving and how much groceries cost. I\nwant to talk about the senator from the\n28th had legislation to talk about how\ndo we address the ever growing\npopulation of corporations that go up on\nthe rent three to five times the amount\nand what folks may make. Uh we could\ntalk about payment source\ndiscrimination. We could talk about HOAs\nand POAS and how they have taken folks\nproperty. Uh but we want to address\nproperty taxes. It's easy to go after\nlocal government because we can't go\nafter uh the big corporate bailout that\nwe gave. The same way I came to this\nwell last year and I talked about to\nreform the bailout for insurance\ncompanies. We're good at doing one thing\nand saying another. If we truly wanted\nto help the lowest common denominator,\nMatthew 25 says, \"When I was hungry, you\nfed me. When I was naked, you clothed\nme. When I was in prison, you came and\nministered to me.\" And when asked when\nwhen did you do all these things to\nJesus? He said, \"When you've done it to\nthe least of these, you've also done it\nto me.\" Then we would absolutely fund\nand make sure the children had summer\nlunch programs and folks weren't hungry.\nWe would make sure that there weren't\nany homeless folks sitting on a $14\nbillion surplus. Because if we truly\nwanted to help the least of these among\nus, we have the power through a budget\nto appropriate it and do something about\nit if we were serious about it.\nNow, the question becomes, where does\nour moral compass actually lie? Because\nif we wanted to make sure the folks did\nnot lose their homes for property taxes,\nthen I would have saw a bill to make\nsure that family in spart of Georgia\nwanted to keep their property. So the\nrailroad didn't come through. We didn't\ntalk about them folks. We pick and\nchoose what we want to come and discuss\nin this. Well, now we want to talk about\naffordability. Well, the Georgia Senate\nDemocratic Caucus has been talking about\naffordability. We've been talking about\nraising a minimum wage. We've been\ntalking about an earned income tax\ncredit. We've been talking about fixing\nthis child care issue that we have in\nour state. You're talking about home\nownership. Well, some folks can't even\nown a home because they're paying child\ncare that cost just as much as a\nmortgage payment. If we're serious about\nit, we would address the things that\nfolks are actually uh dealing with\nbecause many of my folks aren't even\nhomeowners. They're renters.\nSo, they're paying double and triple the\ntaxes because they're renting the\nproperty. So, what are we going to do to\nhelp renters to stay in the homes that\nthey're renting?\nHow are we going to address those issues\nwith affordability? Because everybody is\nnot a homeowner. Are we going to end the\nloophole where you can depreciate an\nappreciating asset where if you own\nmultiple divisions of property, you\ndon't get all of these tax uh deductions\nand incentives? Are we going to do\nsomething about that? We're talking\nabout cutting property taxes. Well,\nlet's make sure we can end the deduction\nwhere if you got multiple properties,\nyou can't depreciate them. Let's do\nthat. Let's get serious about it.\nLet's not come and talk about we're\ngoing to cut taxes in the local\ncommunity because guess what? The trash\nman is in somebody's community. The\npolice officer is in somebody's\ncommunity. Their essential services that\ngovernment funds and they rely on\nproperty taxes to do it. And guess what?\nIf you cut PROPERTY TAXES, YOU MAY NOT\nHAVE THE BASE of sales tax to absorb all\nof this. And this is not a one-t take\nJake a one-sizefits-all because what\nworks in North Georgia doesn't work in\nSouth Georgia. And I keep saying that\nevery time I come to the well, just\nbecause it works for the folks in the\nmore metro areas, it does not work for\nthe folks in the more southern part of\nthe state because folks want to see the\nroad get paid. They want to see the\nsidewalk get fixed. They want to see\nthese things happen. Well, the only way\nthat that happen is somebody got to pay\nthe concrete man. Somebody got to pay\nthe street paving man. Somebody got to\npay the trash man, the firewoman, the\npolice woman, all of those things. And\nnobody uh ever thinks about, well, you\nknow what, I may need insurance until\nyou get sick or hurt. That's when you\nthink about insurance. You don't think I\nneed these services from government\nuntil you pick up the phone and say,\n\"Somebody should do something about\nthat.\" Oh, who's that going to be?\nThat's going to be government. So, if we\nreally want to address the issues with\naffordability, we wouldn't just be\ncoming out in this budget with\nneeds-based aid either. We would have\nbeen doing that. If we were serious\nabout it, we would address child care.\nIf we were serious about it, we'd\naddress the income inequality. We'd\naddress uh the healthc care inequality\nthat we face as a state. If we were\nserious about it, we would have expanded\nMedicaid by now to ensure that working\nfolks had healthcare. So, if we want to\nBE SERIOUS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, COME\nTALK TO ME. WE'VE GOT A slew of bills\nthat the Democratic caucus has put\ntogether, and I would h be more than\nhappy to have you co-sign on any of\nthese pieces of legislation so we can\nactually do something about\naffordability. Now, if we want to work\ntogether on this, colleagues, we can do\nthat in a bipartisan effort, but just\ndon't come and just say this is exactly\nwhat it is and expect me to vote yes. If\nyou want to work with us, we'll work\nwith you. Come talk to us and we'll find\na way to do it together. But if you want\nto have a top- down approach, then guess\nwhat? That's what this will be. But if\nwe're gonna talk about affordability,\ndon't come and give me a vain speech\nabout affordability when we've been\ntalking about it for a while. You just\ntalking about affordability because you\ndone lost a few elections. So with that,\nMr. President, I yield the whale.\n>> Hey, Senator, you have several\nquestions.\n>> Sadly, the senator has yielded the\nwhale.\n>> All right. [snorts]\nChair recognizes my neighbor, the\nsenator from the 13th to speak to the\nmeasure.\n>> Hey, Mr. President.\nOkay, guys. I think we all can agree we\ndon't like taxes.\nNobody in this room wants taxes higher.\nI doubt anybody in this room really\nwants to pay their taxes. But the\nreality of it is taxes are taxes. You\nknow, it's an ugly word. Here's the\nproblem, and I'm going to take blame for\nthis. I made a mistake. I voted for this\nbill last year when it had an opt- out\nclause in it. And I knew better.\nI knew dang well that bill we should\nhave never we should have stood our\nground here in the Senate, sent it back\nto the House and not have an opt- out\nclause in it because we knew darn well\nwhat was going to happen is open up\nPandora's box. Hello, she's here.\nWhere we at right now is can we make a\ndifference? Can we help communities?\nWell, I can tell you right now I can\necho this what several of the senators\nhave said about people in their\ncommunities. We got people this. I got a\nlady 80 years old in my community. 82\nactually. She inherited her house from\nher mother like 40 years ago, 45 years\nago. She's been in there just all this\nlong. It on the lake in our community,\nwhich has now become, you know, this\ndestination spot like all water\nproperties do. And her taxes used to be\nlike $800 a year. Now there's 7 to\n12,000 depending on what because all the\nhouses around her are selling for $500\nto $700,000.\nWe have to do something. We have to put\nthis bill in place. I'm for this bill to\nwhere there's not an opt out. I'm for\nthis bill because I know I have talked\nto my commissioners and my and my tax\npeople in my community and they're\ntelling me this bill will help people.\nThat's all I care about. This bill will\nhelp people. That's what we're here for,\nguys. We're arguing all the time about\nwho's going who's got the bigger pencil\nin this room here. Okay? I The reality\nof it is is I don't care.\nI'm here to help people.\nI'm here to help people. And that's what\nwe should be that's what we should be\nfocused on. And I do believe this bill\nis\nreally right. Now, is any bill 100%\nperfect? I doubt it. But this bill is\nreally getting close to being right and\nputting a bill in place that will help\npeople. And folks, that's what we need\nto be doing. I ask for your favorable\nconsent on this bill to help these 80s\nsomething year old people get their\ntaxes down where they can afford to live\nand not have to sell their home and move\ninto some other whatever because of the\ntaxes that's being created across this\nstate.\nMr. President, I yield well.\n>> Senators yield the well. Chair\nrecognized Senator from the 37th to\nspeak for the measure.\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the\nSenate, I'm going to reach out to\nregular Georgians and explain what this\nbill's doing in plain terms. And I sh I\nshare this in the spirit of of\nbipartisan outreach. Uh I believe\nmembers uh of the Democrat caucus would\nbe well advised to support this because\nI think it's good for your constituents.\nI think this is simply and plainly good\npolicy and I this this is what I would\nshare and I'd really share to Georgians\nwho are listening to this debate. What\nthis bill does is is with respect to\nproperty taxes.\nYou've got homestead properties where\npeople live in their own home and then\nyou have every other form of property.\nevery other form of property and the\nvalue and the taxes assessed on that can\nrise with the market without any\nlimitation under this bill. So if you\nlive in a community that's got\ncommercial buildings, you've got a\nmanufacturing plant, you've got a\nwarehouse, you got a data center,\nwhatever you have in your community\nthat's commercial, those values will\ncontinue to rise as the market\nassessment rises without any limitation\nand all those dollars pour into the\ngovernment coffers as they always have.\nAny property in your community that is\nnot owner occupied, even homes, if you\nhave have landlords, landlords, their\nproperties are going to continue to rise\nwith market values, and the governments\nthat are being talked about here will\nstill get their revenues.\nThis bill only deals with that subset of\nproperty, 25 to 30% of the property\nvalue in my counties, just a very small\nfraction.\nAnd that 25 to 30% of the properties can\nstill increase in value and the tax\nrevenue can still go up every year. But\nthat increase is limited to the rate of\ninflation.\nfriends, where else do you get that deal\nthat you get a guaranteed increase the\nrate of inflation\nfor yourself\num and for 25 to 30% of the properties\nand everything else is unlimited in the\nin the increase in and the revenue that\ncan come in from other properties.\nThat's a really really good deal because\nyou know what governments are not going\nto be significantly impacted by this\nrevenue-wise\nbecause at the end of the day you know\nwhat you know what governments always\nhave the power to do? They've got the\npower of taxation. They can set their\ntax rates however they want to. This\ndoesn't take any ability for governments\nto set tax rates. All this does is it\nsays the assessed value on 25 or 30% of\nall the land in your in your community\ncan still go up but go up the rate of\ninflation. Friends, that is a very very\nsmall impact on government's ability to\ntax.\nBut you know what that is? That is a\nsignificant impact for homeowner\npredictability and certainty to be able\nto stay in their homes.\nThere's a lot of words that are thrown\naround this well. a lot of distractions\nwe've heard today in this debate, but\nI'm talking to my friends in the\nDemocrat caucus. I want you to join your\nRepublican colleagues and support this\nproposition because the powers to tax in\nour governments are still very very\nsignificant across the entire commercial\nproperty base and they can still go up\nat the rate of inflation for the\nresidential homes 20 or five 20 25 30%\nof the land value your communities.\nGovernment can still see increases in\nthose values go up at that rate.\nGovernment still controls the keys.\nBut what's important is there's nothing\nthis Senate has voted on in my time in\nthis Senate that's had a bigger impact\non housing affordability for regular\npeople. Not concepts, not down the road,\nnot setting conditions, not a big broad\nbill, but specific impact for homeowners\nto give them affordability,\npredictability, and stability of the\noverall cost of their homes than this\nproposition.\nI say that with hopes that members of\nboth parties can support this. And\nwhether you're Republican or whether\nyou're a Democrat, if you understand\nthese issues and you think about the\ndetails and you're representing your\nconstituents, this is a very easy vote\nto make. and hope our Democrat\ncolleagues will join us in supporting\nthis proposition. Thank you, Mr.\nPresident.\n>> Chair recognizes the minority leader to\nspeak to the bill.\nThank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief.\nOne of the reasons why we're here, the\nreason why we're even here is because we\nactually did have a compromise between\nthe two parties, between the two parties\nhere late at night to actually be able\nto send this to the voters. actually\nbrought Democrats and Republicans to the\ntable to where we actually had to work\nthrough these particular issues and we\nactually had an opportunity to influence\nthat legislation and then we were able\nto take it to our voters and where after\nhearings our voters then made a\ndetermination\nthat was actually real working together.\nNow though, because we only need a\nmajority vote, we now today have decided\nwe're about to basically scuttle all of\nthat and determine what local\ncommunities may have decided is wrong.\nWhat we decided that night when we\nactually did have a compromise, we\nactually did work together was wrong\nonly because now it only takes majority.\nThat is very interesting. But we should\nnot be lectured to as good friend from\nthe senator from SEG was saying as far\nas who cares about whom. Very\ninteresting thing. Georgia just recently\napplied for the rural health\ntransformation program program coming\nout of the uh president's office. In\nthat application, rural health. In that\napplication, it stated that Georgia's\nrural community suffers from higher\npoverty rates. Had to say that to be\nable to get the money. That's an\napplication from the governor's office\nof governor of Georgia. How is anybody\ngoing to lecture us when many persons in\nthis room represents rural communities\nand you refuse to actually expand\nMedicaid? where you refuse to do ACA tax\ncredits, ACA credits as far as for the\nstate. How is you going to lecture us\nwhen your own communities by your\ngovernor as it applies for funds says\nthat rural communities is suffering from\npoverty? That's not a Democrat saying\nthat. That's the state of Georgia saying\nthat to get money. You know what your\ncommunities suffer, but you're going to\ncome in here and lecture us that we\ndon't care about our communities because\nwe won't pass something that as\nbasically is redinking on something that\nwe agreed on. But yet you have not done\nsomething as far as Medicaid is\nconcerned, as far as healthcare is\nconcerned, but yet the state\nacknowledges that those communities are\nsuffering from poverty. How is anyone\ngoing to lecture us when those same\ncommunities when many people realize\nthat you would destroy your public\nschools have actually said those things\nthat you destroy your own public\nschools, but yet you vote for vouchers\nand allow those schools to be destroyed,\nbut going to come in here and lecture us\nabout who cares and doesn't care about\ntheir communities. when you actually can\nadmit and say that these things are\nactually going to happen but actually\nstill vote against the interest of your\nparticular community. So we're not going\nto take any lecturing. We were at the\ntable before we came to this compromise\nand now because it only takes a majority\nthe compromise goes away and we're\nsupposed to go back to our communities\nand say even though you guys wanted this\nmany of your communities have actually\nopted out of this even though this is\nwhat you wanted after hearing after\nhearing hours after hours discussions we\nhad debates all over the place in\nAugusta we you were wrong and the\nRepublican majority is right now but\ndon't come in here and lecture us about\nwho cares about what I could go through\nthe same mechanics that senator from the\nsecond talked about as far as all the\nthings when you start talking about\nhigher cost as far as rent is concerned.\nWe have a bill that's been presented by\nthe senator from the 28th to talk about\ngiving the counties the option of even\nhaving local rent control that can't\neven come up for a hearing.\nSo there's going to be no lecturing\ntoday. We ought to vote this bill down\nbecause what the people decided just two\nyears ago as far as a real compromise\nand bringing us to the table as\nDemocrats was real. Now what's basically\nhappened is trying to give us a lecture\nand say you better do what we say at at\nthis particular point in time. And we're\nnot going to go for that. We're not\ngoing to take lectures from somebody\nwhen the own state of Georgia says that\nmany of your communities live in poverty\nand you won't even help them without a\nyield. The well\nsenators yield the well. Chair\nrecognizes senator from the 31st.\nHe waves. Chair recognizes the senator\nfrom the 27th to speak to the measure.\nThank you, Mr. President. I rise in\nsupport of this bill. I can think of a\nlot of forms of taxes. income taxes,\nsales taxes, capital gains taxes, death\ntaxes, emissions taxes, gasoline taxes,\nroad taxes, tolls.\nBut in my mind, none of them are nearly\nas unamerican\nas property taxes.\nAnd all that this bill is saying is that\nwe're going to do the exact same thing\nto government\nthat American families have to do. And\nthat is live within your means. We just\ncap the rate of their increases at the\nrate of inflation.\nThat's it.\nBecause what's been happening without\nthis bill and what will continue to\nhappen without this bill is there will\nbe no upside limit on how much a family\ncan be taxed to stay in their own home\nyear-over-year. Not because they made\nmoney, not because they sold a stock or\ngot a promotion or did anything else,\nbut because their neighbor sold their\nhouse for more money. and you wake up\none day and you get an envelope in the\nmail and all of a sudden you're looking\nat a 25% increase in your property taxes\nover last year and the politicians,\nthey get to sit back and say, \"Well, I\ndidn't raise your taxes. I didn't raise\nyour millage rate. Your neighbor sold\ntheir house for more money.\nCongratulations. Send us a couple\nthousand extra dollars and we will say\nthat we didn't raise your taxes.\" Well,\nthe charade is up. People have realized\nthat the tax digest doesn't magically\ncreate the exact amount of money every\nsingle year that cities, counties, or\nschool boards need to run their\ngovernment. And sadly, most of these\nlocal governments have not rolled back\ntheir millage rate in years of\ndouble-digit inflation. Now, the irony\nof the push back from the from the\nminority party on this, of course, is\nthat two years ago, all but seven\nDemocrats voted for this exact language.\nIt wasn't a compromise in this chamber.\nIt was a compromise across the hall. And\nthe opt- out language we have realized\nfrom our constituents who are continuing\nto get the double-digit increases is\nsomething they just can't handle\nanymore.\nAnd so there's been a lot of dialogue\nabout well increase housing supply,\nbring down regulation. We can do all of\nthat and we should look at doing a lot\nof those things. But not one of those\nthings will help my in-laws who are in\ntheir 70s are looking to retire and\ncan't retire because their property\ntaxes have gone up year after year after\nyear in the home that they've lived in\nfor 30 years. So this is not something\nthat just kind of we can think about in\nterms of well we can just push this\naside and increase housing supply and\nit'll solve the problem. It won't solve\nthe problem. Property taxes are the only\nplace that I can think of in the entire\nAmerican economy and certainly within\nthe Georgia tax code where we tax\nunrealized gain. It's unjust. It's\nunfair. This gets us into a posture\nwhere we don't solve the problem. The\nultimate solution here really is to get\nrid of property taxes altogether. All\nthat this does though is as a temporary\nstep to say that the d the days of\ndoubledigit property tax increases need\nto end. And Mr. President, I'm happy to\nstand with the party that is in that\nposture today. And with that, I'll yield\nthe well.\n>> Senators yielded the whale. Uh chair\nwill recognize the senator from the\nsecond\n>> parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Mr.\nPresident,\n>> state your inquiry.\n>> Mr. President, does the majority party\nhave a bill to end the development\nauthorities ability to give property tax\nabatements and its legislative\npriorities?\n>> That's a question each and every senator\nwill have to answer for themselves.\n>> Chair recognizes the senator from the\n27th.\n>> Parliamentary inquiry.\n>> State your inquiry. Mr. President, is it\nnot true that one can abolish a local\ndevelopment authority if they wish by\ndropping local legislation?\n>> I believe the senator knows which he\nspeaks.\nChair recognizes senator from the 14th\n>> parliamentary.\n>> State your inquiry.\n>> Mr. President, isn't true that I'm going\nto purchase for the majority leader a\nlittle bell that he can ding anytime a\ncandidate for statewide office speaks in\nthe chamber?\n>> That That's an excellent idea.\nkind of reminds me of the rules\nchairman's bill.\nMaybe we could get the same making\nmodel. Okay. Chair recognizes the\nsenator from the 35th\nto speak to the measure. And just so you\nknow, I think I will offer the senator\nfrom the 52nd an opportunity to close\ndebate after this. I hope.\n>> All right. Thank you, Mr. the president.\nI really appreciated the debate on the\nfloor um today. I wanted to just give\ny'all a few numbers. Uh during the c\nduring the campaign trail, as I'm newly\na state senator, uh I made a promise to\nmyself to make sure I'm still spending\nhours talking to everyday folks from\nDistrict 35. And this past Saturday,\nwhile we're all uh iced in and snowed\nin, I got a chance to take a couple\nhours and just call voters.\nAnd a familiar conversation came up. And\nI was talking to a woman who was not\nquite old enough to take the senior\nexemption, but not making quite enough\nto keep up with everything going on with\nher her property taxes. Uh we had a\nreally long conversation. Let me just\nshare some numbers with you. And I see\nmany of you are have your calculators\nout um on your calculator app. From 22\nto 23 u her property taxes rose\n$119.\nFrom uh 22, excuse me, from 2023 to 24,\nher property taxes went up $489.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, her property taxes\nhave increased by $1,013.\nThis woman was in tears,\nsaying, \"Do something.\"\nIt didn't feel appropriate at the time\nto say, \"Well, Republican strategy is\nthis and Democratic strategy is that.\"\nThere there has to be some kind of\nboiling point where it says the strategy\nof this state is to do\nsomething\nthat our solution the scale of our\nsolution needs to match the scale of the\nproblem.\nI don't think this solution is great.\nIt's okay. It's something.\nBut it's not enough.\nAnd just like you, I've been in plenty\nof presentations where somebody is\ntelling you what they're doing in their\norganization and they have a bullet\npoint saying we're doing this for\nliterary, this for this. But you know,\nwell, it sounds good, but the scale of\nthe solution is nowhere near to the\nscale of the problem.\nIf we're going to be honest about having\nthis unpredictable rates when it comes\nto property values, I am assuming that\nthis body is going to have that same\npassion with the unpredictable rates\nwhen it comes to car insurance,\nthe unpredictable rates when it comes to\nhealth insurance. I hope that we're not\ngoing to just bore down into our little\nrabbit holes and our silos when it comes\nto other areas of affordability.\nThis is one step,\nbut it's like medicine.\nIf you take an antibiotic for a day, for\na partial dose for one day, it's not\ngoing to do anything. That antibiotic\ngot to be at full strength for 10 days\nif you want that thing gone. And those\nof you who've been through some\nsituations, you know, you take the right\nmedicine for the right dose and for the\nright length of time. The scale of the\nsolution has to match the scale of the\nproblem.\nIt is my prayer.\nIt is my prayer that this body\nwill take seriously\nthe full scale of the solution.\nI am looking forward to just as a robust\ndebate when it comes to our other\nunpredictable\ncosts. I'm a small business owner. I\nneed to be able to predict what's coming\nthe best I can\nwith my few employees.\nThey're depending on me to make good\ndecisions to plan for the future.\nI'm looking forward to this body\ntaking affordability seriously and not\njust take, you know, putting a dollar in\nour front pocket while we\ntake $5 out your back pocket.\nI yield the will.\n>> Chair recognizes the senator from the\n52nd to close debate.\nThank you, Mr. President. Um, I hate\nthat we got off on a lot of other issues\nhere today. I do try to work as always\nin a bipartisan manner. Um,\nI've heard local control,\nbut I know I've got citizens totally\noutraged\nall over the place about this. We've got\nthe lady who got her social security\ncost increase of 2.8%.\nAnd this asks the local governments to\ndo the same 2.8% but not even that\nrestrictive just on the minority of the\nproperty that's homeowner. Stick to that\n2.8% for that lady and do it. Um\nthe capital gains brought up by the\nsenator from the 27th, you know,\nreminded me that a lot of people look at\nthis as they're being taxed on an\nunrealized gain and feel that's unfair.\nThey haven't got the money from the\ncapital gains, but they're being taxed\non it. Um, this was\nalso the senator from the second talking\nabout corporate welfare. I think nobody\nhas fought corporate welfare any more\nthan I have. I look for not spending\nunnecessary money that we should and\nI'll continue to do that. That's not in\nthis bill. That's a different issue, but\nI don't disagree with him on that.\num\nthe senators of the\nand and I do think this was a compromise\nlast year. I don't feel like it was any\ndifferent. The senators from the 36 that\ntalked, the 42nd and the second all\ntwo years ago on our Senate Bill 349\nthat had no opt out in it voted for that\nwith us. We worked on it together. I\ndidn't think I was springing anything\nnew on there. I didn't think it would\nwork. The opt out was between the House\nand the Senate. We disagreed with them.\nIt was the last day. It was a 30%\nsolution. It took care of the 30% of the\npeople who didn't have those governments\nopt out, the other 70%. So, some people\ngot the advantage. We've seen others not\nget it. And we've seen over a few years\nsome increases of different counties. I\nwon't call them out of 62% 95% 85%\n77% 73% people getting taxed out of\ntheir homes. We've got to take care of\nthese people. Um,\nI think this measure puts us back to\nwhat we all voted for two years ago. The\ncitizens approved it and too many local\ngovernments took advantage of the opt\nout and said we don't want any control\nand the citizens are crying for help all\nover the state. Does this solve all the\nproblems in the state? Absolutely not.\nbut it will help those homeowners\nperhaps stay in their home and not get\nthese outrageous increases.\nSo, I would urge everyone here to vote\nfor affordability\nfor our homeowners in Georgia. Mr.\nPresident, I yield to well.\nThe question is on the adoption of the\ncommittee substitute. Is there objection\nto the adoption of the committee\nsubstitute? Hearing none, the committee\nsubstitute is adopted.\nIs there objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which favorable\nto the passage of the bill? The chair\nhas none. The report of the committee is\nagreed to. Is there objection to the\nmain question being ordered? The chair\nhears none and the main question is\nordered. The question is on the passage\nof the bill by substitute. All those in\nfavor of the bill will vote yay.\nOpposed? Nay. The secretary will unlock\nthe machine. [bell]\nOn the passage of the bill, the yays are\n31, the nays are 19. This bill, having\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority, is therefore passed by\nsubstitute\nsenator from the 19th. What's what\npurpose do you rise?\n>> Mr. Mr. President, I ask unanimous\nconsent that we transmit that bill to\nthe House.\n>> The senators asked for unanimous consent\nthat Senate Bill 382 be immediately\ntransmitted to the House. Is there\n>> Okay.\n[clears throat]\nUh\nSenator from 19th, what purpose do you\nrise?\n>> Hold our objection.\n>> Okay, we do have an objection. Um y'all\nwant to put it on the board?\nAll right.\n>> All those in favor will vote yay. Those\nopposed, vote nay. The secretary will\nunlock the machine.\nAll right. On the motion to ad\nimmediately transmit Senate Bill 382 to\nthe House, the yays are 30, the nays are\n20. The motion fails.\nOh my gosh. This is um something we've\nbeen looking forward to. Uh chair\nrecognizes the sen senator from 31st.\nWhat purpose do you rise?\n>> Mr. President, after we just passed the\nbill that address affordability in\nGeorgia, I move that the Senate stand\nadjourned till 10:00 a.m. Wednesday,\nFebruary 4th, 2026.\n>> Secretary read the announcements.\n>> The rules committee will meet upon\nadjournment in room 450 of the capital.\nThe Children and Families Committee will\nmeet at 2 p.m. at in room 450 of the\ncapital. The Retirement Committee will\nmeet at 2 p.m. and 3:10 of CLB. The\nEducation and Youth Committee will meet\nat 3 p.m. in room 307 in the CL. The\ninsurance and labor committee has been\ncancelled at 3 p.m. in Mezzanine 1. The\nHigher Education Committee at 4M is will\nbe in room 307. The regulated industries\nand utilities committee will meet at\n5:00 pm in room 450 of the capital. Mr.\nPresident, that completes the order.\n>> Chair recognizes the senator from the\nETH for an announcement.\n>> Well, we've had a spirited debate today,\nbut I hope we'll never debate the fact\nthat we all support our state's farm\nfamilies and our number one industry. So\ntoday at 5:00 in the blue room at the\ndepot is the Georgia Aggra Business\nCouncil reception and in the morning at\n7:30 is the Aggra Business Council\nbreakfast. So I hope all of y'all can\njoin if you can. Thank you, Mr.\nPresident.\n>> The majority leader has moved that the\nSenate stand adjourned and\nstand by.\nI recognize Senator from 19th for an\nannouncement.\n>> Thank you, Mr. President. Subcommittee\nchairs of appropriations, if you could\nmeet me over here at the corner for just\none second after we adjourn. Thank you,\nMr. President. Yield.\n>> I recognize Senator from the 43rd for an\nannouncement.\n>> Senator,\n>> recognize the senator from the 43rd for\nan announcement.\n>> He waves.\nAll right. The majority leaders move\nthat the Senate stand adjourn until\n10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, February 4th,\n2026.\nAll those in favor of the motion will\nsay I.\n>> Those opposed, no.\n>> On the motion, the eyes clearly have it\nand the Senate is adjourned.",
