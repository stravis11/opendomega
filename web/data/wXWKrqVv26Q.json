And not only is Pastor Chester history maker as one of the youngest pastors in the history of Greater Bill Wood Baptist Church, which was founded in 1876. And not only is Pastor Chester an educated man who attended GW Carver High School in Columbus, Georgia, America Baptist College for his bachelor's and is currently pursuing a master's of divinity at Morehouse College. And not only is Pastor Chester engaged in many civic organizations like Omega Sci-Fi for Trinity Incorporated, Greater Columbus, Urban League, and the end of ACP just to name a few. But Pastor Chester is my friend of more than ten years. He officiated my wedding. He was there when my daughter was born. And he was in being there with me every time the going has been tough. So Mr. Speaker, it is my highest honor and the greatest delight to share my spiritual leader with my esteemed colleagues this morning. Please join me in welcoming to this great chamber, Mr. Adrian Chester. Good morning. For his representative Reese has said this is the day that the Lord has made and I will rejoice and be glad they're in. I'm grateful to share the devotional with you this morning. Several years ago a young man made the decision to leave his home to journey to North Florida to continue his education because at the time of his rearing his community school only went to the seventh grade. Now, as this young man had to make this trek by way of train, he loaded all of his goods into a storage bin and headed to the train station. As he arrived at the train station with great joy and expectation, he went up to the fair booth to pay his fare and he found out that he did not have enough money for his ticket and his luggage. Being a young man full of dreams and full of hopes, he felt that his dream of continuing to make a better future for himself was dashed because of his limited resources. And it was there on the dock of that train station in southern Florida that this young man sat there and he cried. He cried until another man saw his anguish and said, boy, what's wrong with you? This young man says, well, I've made it this far and I know that my grandmother and my mother don't have enough money for me to go back to their house and get more money for train fare. And I'll have to go back and live a life below my expectations because of my limited means. That man who saw this young man at this train dock went into his overall pocket and went up to the fair station to pay for the young man's fare and his luggage. It would be that young man who would go on to Boston College and in 1953 encounter one in whom we know as Martin Luther King Jr. But the young man who had to pay the fare, his name was Howard Thurman. And in his book his autobiography with head and heart, he dedicated that book to the unnamed man who restored my broken dream. So I stand here today, my brothers and sisters asking the question, what if Howard Thurman would have given up on his dream? What if that unknown and unnamed man would have not gone into his pocket and restored Howard Thurman's dream? What if Moses did not go back to Pharaoh? What if Esther did not speak up when it was her time to speak up? What if Joshua did not fight the battle at Jericho? That at every juncture of our living and our life we have what if moments? What if we don't take a stand for justice, wisdom and moderation? What if we do not use the gifts in which God has given unto us to restore somebody's broken dream? What if I failed to be a good steward over the power and influence in which God has entrusted me with what if I keep silent when I should speak? And God asked that question to each of us at every juncture of our lives, what if I don't do what God has called me to do as my grandmother would say to serve this president, my calling to fulfill, oh, made all my power engage to do my masters will. I share with you today my brothers and sisters on this seventh legislative day that God is asking each of us the question, what if and how we respond to that question will not be logged in any newspaper will not be logged in any legislative record but it will be logged on our life's record in which God will ask us the question what did you do to restore someone's broken dream? Let us pray. God of our weary years, God you have been one to hear all of our silent tears and we stand here in this moment knowing and thank you that we have since enough to know that it was you that brought us thus far along the way. So God lest our feet stray from the places our God where we met the less our hearts drunk with the wine of the world we forget the shadow beneath thy hand may we forever stand true to our God in this native land. God we ask now that you endow these your servants with the wisdom that they need in order to make the tough decisions to help bring about the dreams and ideals in which not only the state of Georgia stands for not only our nation stands for but what you as our creator stands for that you have shown us oh God what is right that is to love justice and to do mercy and to walk humbly with our God so God as we deliberate we ask now for a holy ghost power we ask for special anointing that these persons will be good stewards over the trust in which you have given unto them bless us this day and the rest of our days it's in the strong but sweet name of Jesus we do pray we said amen please join me in the pledge of allegiance Pastor we appreciate that devotion this morning thank you we certainly appreciate that doorkeepers will unlock the doors members may greet the chaplain in the south anti-rune\n\nyou you chair recognizes vice chair air heart to device chair of the committee on information and audits vice chair You're recognized.

Chairman Brooks Coleman sponsored him in the past, and this body recognized him as citizen of the day in the past. He's a gastroenterologist from Gwyneth County. He lives in Duluth, Georgia in Sugarloaf. He is an adjunct professor at Emory, as well as Peacom Medical School in Gwyneth County. He's a graduate of leadership Gwyneth, and the Physician Leadership Academy of the Medical Association of Georgia. He is a gubernatorial appointee on the state board of health care workforce, which helps recruit and retain rural doctors. He's the president of the Georgia gastroenterrod... Society, as well as Gappy, the Georgia Association of Indian Physicians. His passion is preventing colon cancer, and as you know, gastroenterologists attend to heartburn, as well as colonoscopies. So if you're having heartburn on anything that's getting done, or not getting done around here, go see him in room 232. I know he'd be glad to see you.

Brian P. Kemp, Governor of the Great State of Georgia and his committee be admitted to the chamber. Thank you, Governor, for being here. I'd like before we get started and hear from our governor. I'd like to recognize a few special guests. I've got my wonderful wife and first lady of the Senate, Jan Jones, there in the balcony right there. I'd like to recognize the speaker of this house, brand new speaker, Mr. John Burns here too. And his lovely wife, the first lady of the house here, Ms. Dale Burns. Please raise her hand. And at the long time, speaker pro-tam here in this chamber, a name I will never forget. Yes, speaker of pro-tam, Jan Jones. The president pro-tam, my good friend from the Senate, Senator John Kennedy. And someone who needs no introduction, our first lady, what a wonderful first lady she has been Ms. Marty Kemp. And also we're joined by Governor Kemp's three beautiful daughters here in the balcony with their mother, Ms. Marty, Ms. Amy Porter, Jared and Lucy Kemp. I told the speaker I would be brief right here and he was appreciative of that. But I do, I want to say it is a pleasure, it's an honor to be in this chamber besides speaker Burns and introducing our governor of the state of Georgia, Brian P. Kemp. And also in his second term, it's been a wonderful first four years and I look forward to the next four years as Governor serves this state with his steady hand at the helm and his fiscal conservative policies. This state has absolutely reaped the rewards of a $6 billion surplus and a state that is being envied by the entire country. And I'm so appreciative of the work that the governor has done as well as with the help of the General Assembly here in the state of Georgia because without you in this room, it would make his job impossible. So thank you, everyone should give themselves a round of applause on that one. He has kept his focus, legacy focus on business development, economic prosperity, childcare, health care and public safety. And I think those are things that he's going to champion in the next four years. I look forward to serving alongside you, Governor and in the next four years. I would like to congratulate the newly elected officials here in this room today. You have been entrusted with this position by your constituency and you should value that trust and hold it as sacredly. I will tell you that we had the pastor of the day this morning and he said that he tells his people in his church that you shouldn't think that you are appreciated by the church, you should appreciate the church for being there. And I think as elected officials, we need to be reminded that sometimes they shouldn't appreciate us being here. We should appreciate the state of Georgia allowing us to be here. And I think that we have a very great opportunity here in the next four years to take this state to leaps and bounds from an economic standpoint, from a health care standpoint.\n\nto an educational standpoint that we might not have thought a couple of decades ago we would be and we couldn't do it without the leadership of our governor and without further ado I'd like to welcome our governor of the great state of Georgia Brian Peakeham Thank you all very much thank y'all so much Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, President Pro Temp Kennedy, Speaker Pro Temp Jones, members of the General Assembly, my fellow constitutional officers, Mayor Dickens, members of the Judiciary, members of the Consular Corps and my fellow Georgians. When I delivered my first state of the state address in this chamber four years ago little did we know the unprecedented challenges that were before us now on the other side of my first term we have overcome each of those challenges and we did it together and we have risen to the occasion each time that change has come speaking of change each chamber has new leadership then when I first began my term and I want to congratulate Lieutenant Governor Jones and Speaker John Burns on their elections I also want to congratulate the newly elected leaders and appointed committee chairs in both the Senate and House I also want to congratulate again my fellow constitutional officers on their recent victories over the last four years our greatest achievements were accomplished when both chambers worked hand in hand with my office to put the people of our state first ahead of the status quo our future as a state relies on that partnership to do the right thing for our citizens even when it may not be easy each of you has my commitment to continue that work and do it together that's good for our entire state because I believe this session will be one of consequence I'm proud to report that

of our state has never been stronger or more resilient thank you all thank you and you all were a big part of that this session we will not only build on the monumental achievements of the past four years we will set George on a path of greatness for generations to come this past year in particular was unprecedented for economic success in the peach state in less than 365 days we announced four of the largest economic development projects in the history of our state those four projects alone will bring over 20,000 new jobs and over 17 billion dollars in investment to rural communities across Georgia those good paying jobs are in fields that would define the next generation of manufacturing and that future will be made right here in Georgia but we are not slowing down just last week we learned that in a first half of this fiscal year our top rank Department of Economic Development helped announce 17,500 new jobs and more than 13 billion dollars of investment come into Georgia and I am especially proud that once again 85% of those jobs are coming to areas outside Metro Atlanta and the good news is our metro areas continue to thrive in this environment as well with organic growth generated by good policies and a pro business approach that we have all worked on with our partners in the private sector to create I want to thank the hard work in men and women of the Georgia Department of Economic Development who helped us bring these unparalleled levels of opportunities to communities all across our state one member of that team is here with us today Unicom Unicom serves as a director of Korean investment and she's been instrumental in bringing literally billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to Georgia Uni would you please stand and let us thank you for all your good work you I also want to thank the members of the General Assembly for your contributions to this effort I cannot overstate how critical your support is when it comes to winning in these competitive environments while also providing a good return on investment that we were literally see for decades in this state thanks to the collective work of those in this chamber those who came before us in the local leadership across Georgia we have been named the number one state in the country for business for nine years in a row but despite all we have achieved there's a growing risk to that number one status the need for more workers and quality homes where they can raise a family in the same community where they work this year the budgets I presented to you make significant steps in addressing both issues we're putting precious state dollars where our priorities are including every level of education to grow a generation of highly skilled workers in fact between both budgets we will devote an additional 1.9 billion dollars to education and fully fund the QBE formula we are expanding we are expanding and reinforcing the workforce pipeline at every level including where it begins in our K through 12 classrooms hard work and teachers are the most impactful elements of the pipeline we're fortunate to have one of them here with us today she's a first grade teacher from Hayhauer Elementary School in Lowns County during the pandemic like so many others who served our classrooms she went above and beyond for her students Lauren Polair were you please stand and let us thank you and your colleagues for all your great work Lauren is now in her fifth year of teaching a milestone when educators often feel burnout and consider leaving their profession to keep our best and brightest in the classroom when I first ran for governor I promised to raise teacher pay by $5,000 with your help we fully delivered on that pledge to reward those who continue to serve after the hardships of the pandemic my FY 2024 budget proposes yet another $2,000 pay raise for teachers like Lauren while some politicians have continued to grumble about teacher pay in Georgia I would like to share the facts in total we would have given we will have given hard work in that drawer educators a $7,000 pay raise in just five years no other general assembly or governor will have raised teacher pay by so much so quickly in state history and I want to thank you all for your support of that with the passage of this budget the average teacher salary in Georgia will also now be over $7,000 higher than the southeast regional average but we know that teachers don't just need more pay and resources they also need reinforcements that's why I'm furthering the teacher workforce pipeline measures we put into place during my first term through the certification grants that will help paraprofessionals become teachers with this one investment we will add close to $5,000 new teachers to our education workforce but we also know the workforce pipeline extends into our world class universities and technical colleges that is why for the first time in over a decade and in the 30th year of this program in the Georgia lottery we are once again fulfilling governor zeal miller's vision and returning the hope scholarship and grants awards to 100% of tuition today we're joined by one of the students and future workers who has benefited from governor miller's legacy and the support of this general assembly oh bison mayu is a hope scholar-ship student at our national championship winning university of Georgia go dogs he is a first generation college student and the oldest of five children his father is retired navy veteran and pastor his mother is also currently in school working to become a doctor by covering 100% of tuition a policy long worked on by members of both sides of the aisle a student like obi will receive roughly $1,000 in additional financial assistance in the coming school year obi will you raise and let us wish you continued success thank you for being with us today we look forward to your continued success in your bright future and i feel certain that you will work here in our state after you graduate we will also continue to focus on apprentices dual enrollment pathways and degrees aligned with the needs of job creators to grow our talent pipeline but where will students like obi and those who learn teaches live when they get into the workforce because of our efforts there's greater opportunity in literally every zip code in Georgia but many of those community struggle to provide adequate workforce housing the transformational projects good paying jobs and new investments are worth little if there aren't options for hard work and Georgians to live where they work we're talking about the people who are teaching our children keeping our community safe who provide life saving support and times of trouble and those who make the goods and provide the services that make a community such a great place to call home that's why i'm creating the rural workforce housing fund enabling the state to partner directly with local governments to develop sites across the state for workforce housing i'm also eager to see solutions that will come from others over the next few months regarding this issue as hard work in Georgians find opportunity in the quality housing that comes with it they also deserve to live work and worship in safety this is something everyone in this chamber can agree on and no issue of public safety had received more bipartisan support than the legislation championed by the nation's best first lady marty kemp and our three daughters working alongside partners on the grace commission like speaker pro tem Jones attorney general chris car the gb i and others they have helped make george a hostile place hostile place for traffickers and a safe haven for victims marty and her partners have worked tirelessly to make georgians throughout the state aware of this evil industry thanks to that good work lives have been saved children but have been removed from dangerous situations and offenders have been put behind bars where they make where they can no longer make victims of the innocent i'd like to ask marty our girls and the others representing the grace commission to stand so we can thank you for your good work you this year we will build on their good work by increasing penalties for those organizations required to provide resources on how to spot human trafficking and what actions are needed to stop it but who unfortunately failed to do so like marty's prior legislation i'm sure it will receive overwhelming bipartisan support and also want to thank the general assembly again for your support of the receiving centers where victims are now finding help and hope this is certainly a resource that is and is still in critical need we will also continue to take violent offenders out of our communities for far too many georgians the safety of their families and homes has put it risk by the unset crimes of street gangs early in my first term we created the gb i's anti gang task force to take the fight to these criminals last year you gave the state a new tool to ensure justice the gang prosecution unit in the office of attorney general chris car i'm grateful that the attorney general and his team have already indicted over 50 gang members in just the first six months of standing up this unit and they have more on the way where local district attorneys are unwilling to confront these violent offenders the gang prosecution unit will today the attorney general is joined by the head of his prosecution to vision john foulard the head of the gang prosecution unit care convry in the head of the human trafficking prosecution unit hanna paul was i hope you all would stand and let us thank you again for your great work we have made great strides in curbing crime but now this fight is entering a new phase and law enforcement needs your help to continue to achieve success in communities across our state gangs are actively recruiting children as young as elementary school students into a life of crime they are targeting the most innocent among us pulling them down a dark path that often leads to a prison sale or cemetery that is why along with the attorney general i'm proposing legislation to increase penalties for those trying to recruit our children into a gang let me be clear you come after our children we will become an after you another lieutenant governor bart jones and his team are also actively working on the broader issue of gang violence and we look forward to partnering with them on these efforts my administration is thankful to the dedication to this urgent problem i also know they're strong bipartisan support for our state law enforcement including the brave men and women of the Georgia state patrol under the leadership of colonel chris right just last week we were reminded yet again of their steadfast courage and the dangers that they face on a daily basis while helping clear the side of the future land of public safety training facility of militant activists a trooper was shot without warning or dust calls he was rushed to the hospital endured multiple surgeries in days of severe severe pain which he is still in but like all troopers he is refused to quit just a few blocks from where we are sitting today he still continues his recovery he and his wife have both our thanks and our praise but also our prayers i had the chance to meet with them earlier this week and his resolve continues to be strong but he continues to need our prayers this is past weekend when out of state writers tried to bring violence to the streets of our capital city state patrol sheriff's deputies in the land of police quickly brought peace in order that's just the latest example while here in Georgia we will always back the blue you this morning we're joined by another trooper one who serves from the skies last year helicotter pilot sergeant Brad herring's Harrison along with the tactical flight officer in a spotter received a call to assist with a search and rescue operation in chatuga county in northwest Georgia a little boy no more than five years old was lost and like all of us would be his family was franning thanks to the skill and quick work of sergeant Harrison and his crew they were able to locate the boy in the field god troopers to his location while circling above and ensure that the child was safely returned to his parents sergeant Harrison would you please stand and let us thank you for your good work and those of all our Georgia state law enforcement these and other public safety officers on boat the state and local levels are unsung heroes we don't always hear about because their acts of service are given without expectation or reservation in light of this past weekends events when men and women in uniform are putting themselves in arms away and literally in the line of fire you can imagine their frustration when one of these criminals ends right back out on the street in a matter of hours just to terrorize those streets further i appreciate that a fulton county judge denied bond to four of the six riders arrested last saturday and gave the other two bonds of over three hundred and fifty five thousand dollars along with the twenty four hour curfew and ankle monitors unfortunately unfortunately this approach is not universal across the judicial system while some may not take this seriously this issue seriously i can assure you that i do we can and we must do something about the revolving door of criminal justice and i look forward to working with this legislature to get it done but in addition to our public safety officers we're also grateful for our health care heroes and simply put we need more of them right now there are sixty seven counties with less than ten physicians and Georgia's need for more nurses as well documented that's why i'm proposing over four point five million dollars in loan repayment programs to grow the number of health care workers in Georgia i'm also i'm also calling for an additional one hundred and two residency slots through an investment of one point seven million dollars with these additions we will exceed the initial goal number of this program and i'm proud to report that the innovative solutions we brought the Georgia's health care challenges continues to bring great results when i first sign the bipartisan patients first act in two thousand and nineteen no counties had more than two health insurance carriers today eighty six percent of Georgia counties have three or more and while others have called for expanding a one-size-fits-none massive government health care program thanks to our policies enrollment in the individual markets has more than doubled since 2019 to over seven hundred thousand Georgia's thanks to our reinsurance program we're also saving hard work in families more and more in their wallets in fact we've reduced premiums by an average of twelve point four percent across the state that represents an average annual premium reduction of almost a thousand dollars a year in rural communities where premium prices were the least affordable when i took office the reinsurance program has reduced premiums from twenty five to forty percent in addition to these innovations in with your help we expanded Medicaid coverage to a full year after a mother gives birth to support new mothers even more my team is proposing legislation that will allow pregnant women who qualify to receive ten if benefits previously they were unable to apply for such assistance until after a child was born i know that this measure is supported by many in this chamber and i'm grateful for your backing since 2018 our state has been over fifteen point three billion dollars on Medicaid with the nine percent increase in spending over that time but while the state spends more and more Georgians aren't seeing improvement in the care they receive here in Georgia we're talking about an innovative and sustainable approach the Georgia pathways to coverage program was negotiated in good faith with the federal government so that we could expand access to health insurance for those who need it the most while also sustaining the quality of coverage but it was the Biden administration that delayed its launch for over a year until thankfully a judge threw out their biased objections to this innovative approach those are the facts when it comes to health care for hard work in Jordan's the Biden administration will rather play partisan politics than get people insured and lowered cost folks we don't have time to wait on Washington and i don't have much patience for DC posturing we are moving forward and we're on target for a launch date of July 1st of this year to meet that goal i'm allocating fifty two million dollars to stand up this program and connect those in needs to its benefit here's another fact upwards of three hundred and forty five thousand Georgians could qualify for the pathways program and health care coverage for the first time with no changes to those who qualify it for regular Medicaid and unlike Medicaid expansion Georgia pathways will not kick two hundred thousand Georgians off their private sector insurance and our state we want more people to be covered at a lower cost with more options for patients and i'm proud to say that both Georgia pathways and access accomplished that goal during this legislative session i want to encourage the men and women throughout this chamber to consider not just the Georgia of today but the Georgia of generations from now you know speaking of generations i have to be careful by how i say this but also just wanted to recognize my mom and cabinet suits here today mom we love you\n\nShe's joined by my sister, Julie Reef, and her husband, Rocky. So we're glad to have y'all today. Love you guys. Three years ago at my state of the state just before the pandemic hit, I shared the words of Nehemiah who refused to slow down or stop his efforts to rebuild his hometown despite heavy pressure to do so. He always delivered the same message. I'm doing a great work and I can't come down. Throughout the pandemic and afterward, we have been reminded that our work continues. And during this session, we should all be too busy to come down into the mud of politics. We have much work to do and we need to get it done for the people who are counting on us. Here at the start of a new session, a new term, and a new era for our state, we have an opportunity to make decisions that will impact our children's grandchildren if we do it right and if we do it together. You know, the campaigns have all been run at least most of them. And the people have spoken. They have given us our marching orders and it's time for us to get back to work. So for the Jordans of today and tomorrow, let's get it done. Thank you all. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the great state of Georgia. Thank you very much. Thank you, Governor. Very well done. And thank you members of the General Assembly, Mr. Doorkeeper. Will you please escort the Governor and his distinguished guests from the Chamber at this time?
