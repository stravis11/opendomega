  "transcript": "Hello.\nYou want to see me laugh?\nCan we see?\nHello.\nHey.\nI know y'all are both on a tight deadline.\nAnd okay, you are on vacation and probably don't want to spend a whole lot of time.\nWas everybody able to look over the recommendations that we sent out?\nYes. Yes, sir. And I appreciate you all sending me your recommendations. I don't we haven't heard of NAMM is going to be on or not, but if you all have any questions about the recommendations, I'd be happy to entertain those.\nIf not, I think our goal here is just to vote on the report,\nand then get it signed and sent,\nbecause today is actually the deadline to get it in.\nSo, Mr. Chair, I had one question,\nand then one thing that I wanted to say,\nthe question is, I still don't know what a retention is.\nWere we able to shed any light on that?\nSo what I found is there are these nurse retentionists that are hired to help, I guess, retain nurses and they just, I think it may have something to do with HR or just, you know, helping hospitals keep nurses in house and to, you know, better the work environment.\nI know that was a recommendation during the from from testimony that we had one of the meetings and so I didn't I didn't see any harm including it.\nBut if there's anyone else that knows more about nurse retentionist than I do, I'd be happy to turn it over to them.\nYeah, I'm just not sure what the action item is, but you know, we, there are a lot of recommendations in this report and some of them are.\nBudgetary, some of them are maybe legislation, some of them are pretty broad, but I think they represent a good picture of all the things that we heard at the committee hearings.\nI personally have a problem, as you know, with number one,\nand I'd sent alternate language that I suggested.\nAnd that's a patient safety issue for me.\nSo if you don't mind, Mr. Chair,\nI'm just gonna read what I sent you if that's okay.\nYeah, that's fine.\nYeah, so I do recognize the excellent training\nthat our CNRA's receiving Georgia, however,\nAnesthesiologists and surgeons\ncomplete an additional four to six years\nof training after medical school\nso that they're ready to take on the entire\nperioperative experience\nand handle life-threatening complications when they arise.\nI believe that health care is best delivered by a team\nof professionals, especially in our rural areas,\nwith less backup when things go wrong,\nwhich thankfully is not very often,\nbut when it happens, it puts you, it's a real thing.\nAnd so I recommend rewarding number one,\nas follows, the committee recognizes\na shortage of medical personnel in rural areas,\nincluding anesthesia.\nAnd that this creates problems for surgical care.\nThe committee also acknowledges the excellent training\nthat's urination receiving Georgia\nand their ability to deliver anesthesia in a team setting.\nThe committee encourages continued conversation\nabout ways to optimize the delivery of anesthesia\nin rural areas.\nSo that was just the language that I suggested\nto replace what was in number one.\nI don't expect everyone in the committee to agree with me.\nAnd so with that, I support the report,\nexcept for number one.\nAnd so for that reason, I would have to vote against the report.\nSo that's the end of my little next story.\nThank you.\nWell, thank you, Kay.\nAnd thanks for your work on this committee.\nI know, I know your stance on number one\nand there are some disagreements there.\nHopefully, you know, during the century,\nwe can find some middle ground.\nMr. Chairman, I will point out if it's okay.\nThe governor had a task force to study\nhealthcare workforce in Georgia\nand number one was one of the recommendations\nthat came out of the governor's healthcare workforce task\nforce and the challenge is what I'm told is that it's an impediment to hiring surgeons\nin these small, small real hospitals, the language and the liability that the surgeon\nfeels like they're taking on when they're not trained on anesthesiology.\nSo we just have a difference of opinion on the policy.\nI do certainly respect Dr. Kirkpatrick's position,\nbut I just disagree.\nSo I fully support the report as written\nand the recommendations as written\nand I'll make a motion at the appropriate time\nto approve that.\nMr. Chairman, yeah, I'm happy the second that motion.\nmotion. Do we have enough people to vote this?\nOkay.\nThen yeah, I will second.\nI will second chairman Walker's motion.\nOkay. Well, then there's a motion in a second on the table.\nThe motion is to pass the report as is.\nAll those in favor.\nWe'll say aye.\nAnd those opposed like sign.\nNo.\nOkay.\nSo it's two to one in favor of passage.\nSo we will have this report submitted.\nI appreciate you all taking the time today and for your work over the last year on this.\nI think there are a lot of really good recommendations that we've gotten out of it.\nHopefully we'll be able to turn these into some good legislation in January.\nSo thank y'all.\nMerry Christmas.\nIf I don't see you and I appreciate you all taking the time today.\nMerry Christmas.\nMerry Christmas.\nMerry Christmas.\nMerry Christmas.\nMerry Christmas!\n",
