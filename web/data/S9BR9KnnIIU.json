  "transcript": "Good morning everybody. If you would please come in and have a seat and we'll we'll begin our meeting.\nI'm going to ask Dean Green to open us up with a word of prayer when I talk to him. It's more than asking to be sure and put a little emphasis on patience today. So Dean.\nHe did ask me to say that, and he also said for those members on the wall that the plate\nwill be passed directly after.\nLet us pray.\nDear Father in heaven, we thank you that we have you and the light of your spirit to guide\nus today.\nAnd we will find, oh Lord, that we have a great task before us, and we do pray for that\npatience and we pray that when we leave here that your will will have been done.\nWe thank you that we may live in the moment of your spirit that we will take each moment\nand know that it is important in the lives of individuals.\nAnd as we serve the people of this day, let us be mindful of our duties and responsibilities.\nFather, we just pray that you will be with us each step\nof the way today.\nBless us now, Father, guide us and direct us in all things.\nAnd we just pray this in the holy name, amen.\nThank you, Dean.\nBefore we get started this morning,\nI'd like to recognize the leader of frustration.\nHe wants to make an announcement.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nWell, in addition to this being a very exciting day\ndue to being Sonny Dye, we also have a special day\nbecause it is Leo Chanci's birthday, the incredible.\nOK.\nLeo, just want to thank you for your great work,\nmaking the Rules Committee run.\nSo effectively, assist in the chairman\nand hope you have a great birthday.\nThank you, Mr. Leo.\nI can't say enough about Leo and Ms. Lewis and Dan in our office up there.\nThey really have done a terrific job for us.\nThank you so much.\nOkay, I'm going to call the rules standing committee to order right now.\nAnd we're going to recognize Chairman Anderson to explain House Resolution 885.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nHouse Resolution 885 is a resolution calling for a House Study Committee to look\nthe elections procedures in the state of Georgia as I took over the\nresponsibility of chairing our governmental affairs committee which I've\nsat on for the previous four years and I know that we have we've done a lot of\nwork in elections to promote integrity we've had some seeing increased\nparticipation increased confidence in our elections but I do feel like it's\ntime for this body to study the procedures the policies and everything around\nour elections process in this state to determine how to proceed and go forward with\nlegislation in the future. And, Mr. Chairman, I would ask for the committee's\nfavorable consideration. Okay, we've got a couple of questions for you.\nWhip Barring. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Anderson, have we ever done study\ncommittees before filings or passing and acting some of these ominous election\nbills, whether it's SB 202 or others, and can you recall when is the last year in which\nwe did not pass legislation that impacts our elections? Because again, I think my understanding\nand concern to a certain extent is, you know, we are doing all these things without necessarily\nunderstanding the impact of some of these rules in which I think it may be, I recognize\nthe intent of this but it this also gives me concern quite frankly as to you\nknow what this may result in given all the past actions that for some\nmembers of my community you know they've been you know harmed to a certain\nextent. Okay and thank you for that question and the question basically gets to\nthe whole intent of this committee. This is my fifth year serving in this body\nand in the five years I've been here we have looked at and attempted many\nelections, law changes and considered many bills. In the time that I've been here, I'm\nnot aware of a study committee. I do know that Senate Bill 202 came from a special committee\non election integrity, which looked in depth at the concepts that were proposed in that\nbill and eventually passed into law. So I do think it's high time that we take a close\nlook at the entire procedure. Okay, we have a question of representative Evans.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, to the Chairman of the podium. It seems to me that if a study\ncommittee is just going to have members of the legislature, which this one proposes, then\nit would make more sense for the standing committee to just have a series of meetings.\nBut since there seems to be a desire to have a study committee, would you be opposed to\namendments to direct that there also be members of the committee that are not legislators\nand that we make sure, for example, some that I'm thinking of would be election board\nchairs or election board members from our counties and making sure that we spread those\nout between Metro, Middle, North, and South Georgia, also perhaps some lawyers who specialize\nin election law and there may be other stakeholders that we want to include, would you be amenable\nto such amendments?\nI, of course, am amenable to the will of the committee and the intent of this was to have\nthe speaker select amongst the House of Representatives, the members he would prefer\nto see in this, of course, with consultation.\nSo to your question directly, I'm standing here presenting this request and at the will\nof the committee.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nLady Hughley.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nwas getting to my question as to why the committee couldn't just study it on its own, but since\nI do have the mic, I would like to ask the chair to think about not imposing new rules\nin an election year because we don't want citizens to participate and not be confused\nabout what the election procedures and laws are.\nSo that would be the only thing that I request.\nAlso, I would request that possibly making an amendment\nsuch that there would be equal representation\non this committee of the minority\nso that we can have all perspective at the table\nwhen we do this deep dive.\nOkay, I'll put Jim Jones at a question.\nYes.\nDo you say, Mr. Chairman, that it is most common with how study committees that they are comprised of legislators, not non-legislators, and then you rely on the very persons that have been suggested from all walks of life that could give input but would not be officially on the committee so that you would have more flexibility?\nThank you for that question and I would agree with that the study committees I have served on and chaired in the past have been comprised of all House members however the intent of the study committee is not necessarily with a predetermined in game is to study the subject matter to accept testimony from the experts and my fear is if we invite outside experts or particular bodies we're going to leave people out and we're going to leave a perspective out.\nThe best option is to have the legislative body as the committee and then the testimony comes from those people so thank you\nChairman Martin\nMr\nChairman\nIsn't it true that there are many things that have involved in the election process that don't directly\nInterface with the public and isn't it true that I've received many calls\nAnd I think you and I have spoken about the logistics of the back office of how the ballots get from one place to be counted\nsecurity of the ballots before and after the counting isn't that what you're\ntalking about in lines five through eight that those things are not public\nfacing but very important to the public isn't that not what you're trying to do\nhere okay we've heard the explanation of the presentation on House\nresolution 885. Do I hear a motion do pass? Have a motion to pass and a second is\ntheir opposition. Excuse me. Okay what's your amendment? Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd\nlike to ask the committee to consider two amendments and I can put them in one\nmotion or two. Put them together. Okay. It's easier. On lines 20 between the\nrepresentatives and as determined, insert the words with equal numbers from\nmajority and minority parties but otherwise. So the tenants would read the\ncommittee shall be composed of a number of members of the House of\nRepresentatives with equal numbers from the majority and minority parties but\notherwise as determined and appointed by the speaker of the House of\nRepresentatives. And then the second part of the amendment would be to insert\nafter that period, the Senate's, the speaker shall also appoint citizen members representing\nat least the following. Three election board chairs representing Metro, North, South,\nand Middle Georgia counties. And the purpose of the first amendment, Mr. Chairman, and members\nis that unlike a lot of study committees, I think it's even more important that we have\nequal representation among the parties because we're dealing with elections and we want\nthere to be integrity in the process.\nWe want to ensure absolute fairness.\nWe want to ensure that the public accepts the results,\nnot as a partisan effort, but as a joint bipartisan effort.\nAnd then the reason for the county election board members\nis that we do so much that ultimately becomes the job\nof these individuals.\nAnd so while sometimes, and I expect this committee would hear\ntestimony from all sorts of stakeholders,\nwe would want these county election board chairs\nfrom these various types of counties to be represented.\nso they could be involved in the entirety of the discussion\nto make sure that they get all their questions answered\nand perspectives considered,\nso we don't put undue burden on them.\nAnd I know I have served on study committees\nwhere like for example, on higher education,\nwe had representatives from both TCSG and the region.\nSo this is certainly not unorthodox\nand I would say is just respectful\nthe fact that we'll be passing potentially\ntalking about changes that will impact them.\nAnd so I would move that as a motion for the consideration of the committee.\nOkay.\nYou've heard the motion.\nIs there a second?\nOkay.\nNow we'll have any other discussion on that.\nOkay.\nWe will vote on the motion.\nAll those in favor of adding the amendment to the resolution will say yes.\nAll those opposed will say no.\nNo.\nNoes have it.\nOkay.\nWe're back to the motion to do pass out of the committee on House Resolution 885 all those in favor say aye\nThose opposed. We know\nIt carries so it will come out of the committee with a do pass recommendation\nThanks, sir. Thank you. All right now. We're going to adjourn the rules standing committee and\nconvened the committee on rules\nthat will set the calendar for day 40.\nOne item of housekeeping.\nI would like to have a motion on Senate bill 260\nthat it be returned to committee.\nBe recommitted.\nHave a motion and a second.\nAny discussion?\nAll those in favor say aye.\nAny opposed?\nIt's back in the committee.\nOkay, now we're ready to take requests. Yes, ma'am, chairman.\nGood morning, Mr. Chairman. Happy signing day. We're here. We're finally here. I am here to represent Senate Bill 91. It's on the third page up at the top.\nAnd what this bill does is it melds two measures together.\nI bring before you the measure that was adopted March 6th through the house and it stalled\nover in the Senate.\nThis is a supplemental metagap bill for patients with Lou Gehrig's and end-stage renal disease\nhelps them to be qualified for Medicare under 65 and then that way they can buy Medigap\ninsurance for transplant, kidney transplant.\nThe other piece to this is a measure that helps men under 65 be able to have prostate\nexams and some education attached to that.\nOkay, you've got a question for you, President Williams.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author here.\nJust a question.\nDid you research and see whether or not this bill singled out\npharmacist or how it looks over the board?\nIt doesn't, it won't affect the pharmacist at all.\nThis is just Medicare for people under 65.\nand then the prostate piece is for under 65, too.\nBut it doesn't affect pharmacy\nor the drug piece to Medicare.\nOkay, don't see any other questions, thank you.\nIt is a substitute, yes.\nDid you have another one?\nPardon me?\nNo, sir, that was two pieces, thank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I've got SB 179. It's on page three toward\nthe bottom. This bill requires students to take a computer science class or a CTAE course\nembedded with computer science beginning in the 2031-32 school year. It changes the\nreimbursement cost of tuition for the Georgia virtual school because that has not been\nadjusted since 2012 and it requires private online virtual schools to report\nenrollment of students to the students home school district. This is so we can\nbetter track chronic absenteeism and this is LC 492411S. Okay, don't see any\nThank you so much.\nThank you very much.\nGood morning.\nI'm here to present HR 304, which proposes a house study committee to look at the health\ncare costs of smoking.\nI want to first in particular thank some of the co-sponsors who are here who have supported\nthis issue for at least the past five years including doctors, Newton and Hawkins,\nChair Cooper, Chair Stevens, Dean Green, and also across the whole way Senators Albers,\nHuff Settler, and Robertson.\nSo what this study committee would aim to do is look at the costs incurred by the significant\nburden of smoking in this state.\nThis could include looking at Medicaid costs, cost to Medicare and private insurance,\nalso looking at geographic distribution and variability in how these costs are incurred\nand borne.\nSo impacts on the workforce, impacts on children, asthma rates, school absenteeism, and if it\nis the will of the community to look at also the healthcare costs of vapes, which as we\nknow is more born in younger patients.\nIdeally, we would identify areas for intervention and for cost saving and also possible readily\ngeneration for the state.\nI'm happy to take any questions.\nOkay.\nAnd don't see any questions.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you, Jim Clark.\nThank you, Chairman.\nI've asked for a Senate bill of 101, page three, on a modified structure.\nAnd Senate bill of 101, it's the original and my original house bill, 87 language that\nwe passed, almost unanimously, minus two votes.\nIt allows those who need orthotics and prosthetics to be able to get additional ones so they can\ndo just simple things like go shower.\nSo it got kind of late and open the Senate and so the sponsor let me take out his original language and put mine in\nI'll be glad to answer any questions on that one\nOkay, don't see any questions. I have one more house resolution 817. It's a house study committee on drones another bill. We passed out\nThe bill number and this would just it got held up in the Senate and this would just dig more into drones\nNow security keeping our community safe and just ask for house resolution 817. Any questions?\nYou have a question for you. You're heugly.\nThank you, Mr. Chair. Oh, on your 101. What was your bill number that we're replacing here?\nHouse bill 87. That was the orthotics prosthetics. Thank you. Okay. No more questions. Thank you.\nYes ma'am.\nGood morning Mr. Chairman, members. This is for House Resolution 753. It's a house\nstudy putting together house study on improving access to internal medicine in\nrural areas with the challenges in those areas being getting health care into\nthe rural areas consistently getting doctors into the rural areas\nconsistently and perhaps being able to bring a mobile unit and see what that\nlooks like. Okay don't see any questions thank you. Yes sir we do Kelly. Thank\nyou Mr. Chairman, members of the committee I'll be asking for a committee sub\non Senate Bill 10 to the LC481626S. That simply does is codifies and\nclarifies the way that judicial officers are selected and appointed in judicial\nSo I have at least 15 superior court judges.\nPassed and you did share a committee unanimously.\nOkay, don't see any questions.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nThat's your favorite consideration.\nHere we go.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI'm asking for a committee sub for Senate Bill 218.\nI'm also going to sub 218.\nThis is cleaned up language for the prosecuting\nattorney's qualifications commission.\nWhat it does is it moves, I'll take the highlights.\nmoves the commission from the PAC prosecuting Attorney's Council to the AOC\nAdministrative Office of Courts to solve some conflict of interest issues. It\nclears up that a state employee, the D.A.R. judge who is on one of the panels may\nbe reimbursed by their office or by the P.A.Q.C. meetings but not by both. It\ncleans up that the rules, the rules were not approved and adopted until April\nthe first 2024, so the cases that they're hearing won't be before that process or that\ntime period. It fixes that they hired an executive director, where the law actually says\ndirector, clarifies the appeals process, says that it starts with a Ph.U.C. then is\nappealable to the Superior Court, the Appellate Court, then the Supreme Court. And then lastly,\nit modifies the confidentiality for the DAs and solicitor generals so that they can find\nout about complaints made against them but dismissed before reaching the public\nstage. It also specifically addresses their concern that if a complainant\npublicizes that they filed with the P.A.Q.C. that they can tell the DA or the\nsolicitor what's going on so that they can respond publicly. I'd have happy to\nanswer any questions.\nDo you have a question here in the\nI'd received a call from some of the sheriff's regarding when portion of this I\nI guess that last section are you familiar with their concern?\nYeah, so this is why the big reason why we're doing the amendment\nand committee it was amended and it was added to all lawyers\nand good standing carry a gun in the court.\nWe would just to the back to the latest Senate had originally.\nOK, thank you.\nOK, I don't see any more questions.\nThank you so much.\nYes, sir, Mr. Chairman, if you read that yesterday's report\nIt's pretty sick before we get it.\nIt was, my people are still going over it,\nbut yeah, it was a lengthy journal yesterday,\nso hope to have it done by 10 o'clock.\nMr. Chairman, members of the committee\nhonor to present a House Resolution 816 on page two\nof the blue sheet.\nThis creates a study committee with two focus areas.\nNumber one, creating a abuse registry\nfor our at-risk populations.\nAnd number two, how to improve service delivery\nof state resources to individuals with disabilities.\nOkay, I don't see any questions.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nOkay, any members of the committee?\nChair Lady Taylor.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, committee.\nI'd like to ask for House Resolution 847.\nAnd this is to do a House Study Committee on the Funding for Public Health.\nAnd it's just, we put a lot of stress on our public health and we want to make sure they're getting the funds they need.\nOkay.
