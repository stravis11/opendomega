and be\nglad in it and I'm surely glad in it\nbecause this is my 11th year in this\nchamber and this is my third time\nintroducing the chapter of the day and\nI'm proud to introduce my friend my\npastor Colby McKenzie but before I do\nthat I want to recognize his lovely\nmother Burnett and his aunt Darlene if\nyou would please welcome them to this\nchamber\ncolleagues I bring to you none other\nthan the Reverend Kobe McKenzie the\npastor of the Oak Grove Missionary\nBaptist Church in Milledgeville Georgia\nthe new Pilgrim Missionary Baptist\nChurch in Macon Georgia and the Magnolia\nBaptist Church in Montezuma Georgia the\nhome of the late great representative\nLynn Moore James so I am so proud to\nhave him here and now let us welcome\nReverend Kobe McKenzie\nwelcome sir good to have you much\nto God our Father Jesus Christ as our\nsavior who died for our sins on the\ncalvary\nto the Holy Spirit who's our comforter\nand our teacher well certainly to all of\nyou a speaker and to those of you who\nserve as elected officials\ncertainly to any clergy or present\nwhen you get to your own private praying\nground of your leisure time\nstand here not on my own efforts\nbut as a sinner saved by grace\nthrough faith our Lord Jesus Christ\nJeremiah's gospel chapter number three\nverse 15 says\nand I will give you Shepherds\nafter my own heart\nwho will feed you with knowledge\nand understanding\nJeremiah 3\nverse 15 and I will give you Shepherds\nafter my own heart\nwhich shall feed you with knowledge\nand understanding\nTheses are objective of our devotional\nmessage for this brief time\nsimply is this rising to the spiritual\nchallenge\nvery quickly to give you a history of\nthe background of our texts\nJeremiah is a young lad who was from a\ntown called anaphor\nwas raised around his father hilkaya\nhilkaya was a preacher Jeremiah in that\ntown called NFL was raised around\npriests\nhe never sought out\nnever had the intention to preach or\nprophesy but God called him\nthe Bible says that according to God\nthat he\npre-ordained Jeremiah\nfrom the womb\nbecause in Jeremiah chapter number one\nit says before I formed thee in the\nbelly I knew thee I Sanctified an\nordained thee as a prophet to the nation\nthat word Prophet is different ladies\nand gentlemen from the word priest\nbecause that word Prophet simply means\none who stands on behalf of God before\nthe people\nthe word priest means one who stands\nbefore God on behalf of the people\nat the time of our text the world was\nfilled with immorality\nbrutality and in Justice\nand God calls a little boy named\nJeremiah\nand he says unto Jeremiah\ngo and speak for me Jeremiah says I am\nYoung\nGod says don't say that you're young but\ngo wherever Cindy\nspeak whatever I tell thee Jeremiah like\nyou and I when God speaks we need\nconfirmation he says Jeremiah what do\nyou see very quickly Jeremiah says I see\na branch off an almond tree\nhe says in essence a Jeremiah that means\nI'm with you\nhe says what else do you see he says I\nsee a Boiling Pot of water\nGod says that's my angering that's\nthat's my wrath against the people\nbecause of their wickedness at the time\nof our text the people of God the people\nof this world had fallen away from God\nand falling away from worship which then\nsets us into sin of idolatry what is\nthis gist what is the objective of the\nmessage here it is when you look at the\nword in Morality and the word injustice\nand even brutality that's Jeremiah\nchapter number one the background of the\ntext but doesn't it seem like today\nimmorality brutality and Injustice and\ncan't you hear the people saying\nJeremiah can't speak to us he cannot\nprophesy to us he's too young he's too\ninexperienced let me help you by the aid\nof the Holy Spirit ladies and gentlemen\nmy brothers and sisters in Christ\nwhen God calls you\nhe sanctifies you the word sanctify\nmeans sanctification which means sacred\nmeans for Holy use for holy living\nGod says in essence that the people have\nbeen indulged in adultery but God says\nin the closing of our message in chapter\nnumber three that is just like a wife or\nin essence or a husband who goes out and\ncheat on their spouse\nladies and gentlemen does that seem like\ntoday\nour world we have\nindulge in first teachers acts with the\nany man\nladies and gentlemen\nand the God we serve he's a jealous God\nand whenever we seem to be at that point\nof idolatry God would give us grace and\nmercy but to a certain extent he will\npour out his Wrath\nJeremiah stands and speaks to the people\nof God\nand my challenge for you today is ladies\nand gentlemen that in this world that\nwe're living in no matter how unpopular\nthis message may seem\nwe have a spiritual wickedness in the\nland\nwhat is the spiritual what is the soul\nit is a seat and the character of our\nemotions\nladies and gentlemen I too am like\nJeremiah\nat the latter part of age of 15 in the\nninth grade year God called me\nand whenever God calls you\nit's not always about pleasing those or\nto be pimped and primed by the people\nbecause he tells Jeremiah be not afraid\nof their faces\nhe says whatever I say unto you you\nshall speak\nas you serve\nin this great state of Georgia\nGod is calling you\nto rise to the spiritual challenge\nbecause where there is no challenge\nthere is no growth\nand I'm afraid although I'm in this new\ncoming generation we always want to be\ncongratulated but never convicted\nbut isn't convicted it's in not all the\npeople who said Kobe you're a great\npreacher but it's in those individuals\nlike you who pulled me to the side and\ntold me you're wrong that helped me in\nthis life\nso the message devotional message to you\ntoday\nis rise to the spiritual challenge\nwhere's the spiritual challenge it is\nfine in the book\nGenesis through revelation\nbut there's another one\nhis name starts with Jay it's not\nJeremiah but I want to close by telling\nyou this thank God for Jesus\ntherefore we have all fallen short of\nthe glory of God\nbut the Christ that we serve no matter\nyour race no matter your ethnicity he\ndied for you when he died for me\nleave this session when session is over\nknowing that we must rise to the\nspiritual challenge\nJeremiah was very much aware he was very\nyoung but he was also politically alert\nit was also economically alert\nbut at the same time\nit is deceit\nand the characteristic of our emotions\nthat corrupts the land shall we stand\nfor prayer\nGod we honor you now as\nthe maker and creator of all things in\nall people\nLord we honor your son Jesus Christ\nLord we honor the Holy Spirit\nGod\nthanks to you for this opportunity\nthanks to these your people who have\nallowed me to come\nand who have accepted me\nGod I prayed I've searched and I assault\nyou for weeks now\nand I've given the people everything\nthat you have given me\nI pray Lord that these your people have\nbeen educated today\nthey have been enlightened\nand through the teaching of the Gospel\nthey have been equipped to go out and\nserve and in that word challenge help\nthem to know to not leave emotional\nriled up\nbut to know that there will be some\ndifficult days ahead there will be some\ntroubles God I pray for our government\nno matter which party it is\nbecause God you have the power\nto work on the hearts of Kings\nyou have the power to work on hearts of\nQueen\nhelp us to lay down our own Pride\nand as Jesus said deny ourselves\npick up our cross\nand follow you\nthe Lord we pray for our country we pray\nfor the people I pray Lord that you will\nbring a Revival in the land\nand in the midst of Revival bring\nrevitalization\nand God I'll give you the glory for what\nyou have done what you are doing right\nnow and what you're about to do\nin Jesus name amen\nlet us turn to the flag for the\npleasures of Legions in unison\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the\nUnited States of America\nfor which\none Nations\nstand right there\nright here by Patty I'm gonna do this\nnext part\ndoor Keepers will unlock the doors\nmembers we may join Pastor McKenzie

different hospitals\nclinical trial organizations whoever it\nmay be can reimburse the patient for for\nhotel stays and travel\nto me it's sort of amazing we have to do\nthis but such is the case so that's what\nthis bill speaks to it it allows\nespecially important it allows people to\ngo into clinical trials whether they\nhave the financial means to do so or not\nso this opens it up for everyone in any\npatient if there are no questions Mr\nSpeaker I will yield the well\nyou have no questions\nthe gentleman has yielded the well is\nthere any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair here\nhas done the previous question is\nordered is there any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill the chair he has done the\nreport of the committee is agreed to\nshall this bill now pass all in favor of\nthe passage of the bill will vote Yes\nall those opposed will vote no and the\nclerk will unlock the machine\nhave all members voted\nif so the clerk will lock the machine\non the passage of the bill the yeas were\n170 the Nay zero the bill haven't\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed\nMr Clark will you read the caption to SB\n5959\nSenate Bill 59 by Senator Hatchet to the\n50th and others to be entitled an act to\namend chapter 12 the title 45 the\nofficial code of George annotated\nrelating to the governor since\nestablished the office of the Inspector\nGeneral this bill ever referred the\ncommittee on Judiciary that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nchair recognizes a representative Hong\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I present to you SB\n59 this has to do with the officer of\nthe Inspector General what this bill\nwill do is codify that office as well as\ngrant them law enforcement Authority the\noffice of the Inspector General has been\nin place since 2003. their job is to\num they're essentially an oversight\ninvestigator for fraud waste any type of\nethical issues within the executive\nbranch they don't do any oversights over\nJudiciary uh or legislative branch\nbut just the executive branch and again\nwhat this bill will do is um\ncodify the the office as well as give\nthem law enforcement Authority in order\nfor them to subpoena and have arrest\nPowers I'll take any questions Mr\nSpeaker\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark to your\nleft has a question\nthank you Mr Speaker this is General\nlady yield I do um so you said that this\noffice specifically focuses on fraud at\nthe executive level is that did I hear\nthat correct so any employees officers\num within the executive branch so\ndifferent departments and agencies\nwithin the executive branch there's a\ngeneral idea for the yield yes so\num by creating this law enforcement arm\nof the inspector General's office will\nthey uh will they carry firearms and be\narresting members of or staff or\nwhatever from the executive branch or by\nwhat will be their jurisdiction as far\nas who they can carry off in handcuffs\ncorrect and they will have arrest power\nso they have to be certified peace\nofficers that will have arrest Powers\nwithin currently the office of Inspector\nGeneral they have about nine or ten\nemployees currently and about four of\nthem are posted fight officers so it\nwill allow them to be able to arrest and\nin addition to investigate and then to\nGeneral lady yield for one more yes I'm\njust curious\nusually when we do things like this\nthere's a reason is there a reason why\nwe need to is there did something happen\nthat initiated this bill needing to come\nto our desk today yes\num so again this has this office has\nbeen and this agency has been in place\nsince 2003\num\nbut because they haven't been able to\nhave certain powers like subpoena powers\nand arrest Powers it has delayed their\ninvestigation it has put certain\nofficers in a dangerous position where\nthey are\nfaced with faced with criminals that\nthey are unable to arrest right away\nbased on their investigation so and they\nhad to rely on different agencies for\nthese law enforcement powers and so\nthis has been brought up and it has been\nit has been an issue so this will allow\nthem to do their job more efficiently\nthank you thank you\nthe lady has no further questions thank\nyou and I um asked for a favorable\nconsideration of this Bill thank you and\nI yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well is there\nany objection to the previous question\nbeing ordered chair hits none

181-181\nSenate Bill 181 by Senator Payne to the\n54th and others to be entitled an Act 2\namend chapter 25 the title 50 the fish\nDakota George annotated relating the\nGeorgia technology Authority

the\ncommittee on Judiciary non-civil that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass\nchairman Tyler Paul Smith is recognized\nto present the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I'll be brief since\nI'm holding up in lunch and I'm Baptist\nso house members I bring to you today\nSenate Bill 181 and just to let you know\nthis does three things it allows the GTA\nwhich the Georgia technology authority\nto fingerprint employees with access to\nor proximity to federal tax information\nit allows GTA to fingerprint contractors\nand subcontractors it also would allow\nGTA to fingerprint all current and\nfuture employees beginning on January\nthe 1st of 2025. just so you know recent\naudit conducted by the Internal Revenue\nService determined that certain\nemployees of the GTA have access to\nfederal tax information but have not\nundergone the fingerprint criminal\nbackground check required in the IRS\npublication 1075.\nthe IRS had actually established a\nJanuary 31st 2023 deadline for GTA to\ncomply with these requirements and\nthey're having to give weekly updates on\nthis matter until we can get this done\nhere in the legislature so with that Mr\nSpeaker uh year yield for any questions\nif there are any you have no questions I\ndid have one are you a tax attorney no\nsir I specifically made sure not to take\nthat same Professor that I had in tort\nlaw well so you do have one question if\nyou'll yield yes sir\nrepresentative Ramon is recognized for a\nquestion does the gentleman yield yes\nfor Coalition thank you\num just really quickly is the agency\nitself doing the fingerprinting in-house\nare they going to have someone else do\nit for them and then it gets sent to the\ngbi I understand what it would be uh\ncurrently I want to say that it would\nprobably be down at the sheriff's office\nhere in Fulton Canada that's usually how\nthat works okay so that's my\nunderstanding one more question yeah\nwould would this bill allow for them to\nbe able to use other vendors to get\nfingerprinting in case for whatever\nreason someone can't access the\nsheriff's office they could potentially\nis my understanding so I'll follow up\nand get an answer for you on that\nspecifically though thank you thank you\ngentleman year for one more just one\nmore miss one more representative\nJasmine Clark is recognized to your left\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield for my friends\num this is a very easy question I'm just\ncurious why wait until January of 2025\nif you said this is something that is\nactually\nurgent\num and it specifically says January 2025\nnot why why not until the signing by the\ngovernor so my understanding is that\nthis is giving them time to make sure\nthat all the folks that they bring in\nthe subcontract workout for GTA that\nthey could actually have them\nfingerprinted and complied with my\nunderstanding is that the actual GTA\nemploys those would be the first to be\nfingerprinted under this legislation\nonce we pass it\ndoes the gentleman further yield one\nmore is it possible that\num this can be done much sooner than\nthat it seems pretty urgent and 225 is\npretty far away that's what we're hoping\nis they'll get it done as soon as they\ncan and would be done hopefully even a\nyear before that\nthank you thank you Mr Speaker with that\nI yield well\ngentleman has shielded the well is there\nan

it's a a consumer bill\nconsumer protection Bill one of the best\nones I've seen is for large unsus\nsolicited door-to-door transactions uh\nit's modeled after the Federal Trade\ncommission's uh National door to door\ncooling off here that we've had since\n1992 and that's just a three-day cooling\noff period but when we have these large\nunsolicited door-to-door\nuh salesman\num where this bill takes it to a 30-day\ncooling off period uh with three\nelements that might happen it's\nunsolicited it's ten thousand dollars or\nmore in cost uh it includes a leasing or\na financing of 10 years or more\nand uh eligible for federal tax credits\nand so this bill just really simply\ngives our Georgia consumers more time to\ncheck the information that they're\npresented to them\nunsolicited some of these large\ntransactions are very complex very large\nties our consumers up for many years\nuh on these and um\nand so I think the bill is is uh\ntailored to not to include some other uh\ntransactions but but these uh large ones\nuh a lot of these uh cons these uh solar\ntransactions of what this build is\nreally targeted toward and um I'll just\num I want to also thank our house\ncommittee uh chairman Parsons and\nrepresentative Gallup for working on\nthis for several years is two this is\nnot their bill but but they have really\nuh targeted some some other legislation\nthat would would help in this area for\nour consumers so with that\nMr Speaker I would happy to take any\nquestions\nyou have no questions thank you I'll ask\nyou a favorable

the\n50th and others are being titled act to\namend title 16 in the official go to\nGeorgiana relating to crimes and\noffenses so survived for the mandatory\nminimum penalties for violation of the\nstreet gang terrorism and prevention act\nthis bill that refer to the committee on\nJudiciary non-civil that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass by\ncommittee substitute\nbefore we begin debate on this bill I'll\nlet all the members know we do have\nmembers that will speak in fact the the\nauthor will present the bill we have\nmembers in favor those opposed and we\nhave a Minority Report and we do have\nsome time limits so we would adhere to\nthose time limits\nchair recognizes\nGovernor flow leader Hong to present the\nbill\nthank you Mr Speaker I am here to\npresent Senate Bill 44 on behalf of the\ngovernor\nthis bill revises the punishment for\nviolations of the Georgia street gang\nand terrorism prevention Act\nit provides for enhanced sentencing for\nrecruiting when such violation involves\na person under 17 or a person with a\ndisability and additionally codifies the\ncurrent practice for issuing or bonds so\nspecifically this bill\nwill establish a mandatory minimum\nsentence of five years if you are in\nviolation of the criminal street gang\nstatute\nin addition it's going to enhance\npenalties on those adult gang members\nwho are recruiting our children that are\nunder 17. gangs must recruit in order to\nsurvive and we are sending a strong\nmessage with this bill that if you come\ninto our state and you are recruiting\nour children then we will have severe\npunishment for you\nthrough this spell\num you we are helping our victims we are\nhelping victims of gang activity as well\nas our children from being recruited\ninto gangs\nin addition we are we are codifying what\ncurrent judges are doing as far as or\nbonds or unsecure judicial release\nso it will have the judges look to\nwhether or not a accused has been\nconvicted of any bail jumping in the\nlast five years it will also have the\njudge look to whether or not there's\nbeen a bench warrant that's been issued\nin the last five years and it does not\naffect any traffic offense failure to\nappear\nin addition it will have the judge look\nto any criminal history of the accused\nwhen considering or bonds and with that\nMr Speaker I will yield for any\nquestions\nyou have no questions\nyou do have thank you a couple now okay\nalmost\ntwo-year left representing more to your\nleft has a question representative Moore\nis recognized for a question\ngood morning this is the gentlelady\nyield well I do\nnot the well but you yes\num when you said the mandatory is that\nfive years or ten years because the\nmandatory minimum in Georgia is 10 is\nthat correct no it's not currently\num this is enhancing it to five years\ncurrently it's three years\nis the minimum now would the judge have\nleeway to go to the maximum of 10.\nso\nthis bill is going to increase the\nsentencing from 5 to 15 years and just\nlike any sentencing as far as judges go\njudges can look to and and sentence up\nto the maximum if if needed correct I\nsee so 5 to 15 years five to fifteen\nyears for gang activity now if you are\nrecruiting\nsomeone that is under 17 then the\num the sentence goes from 5 to 20 years\nand do you further I'm sorry 10 to 20\nyears you further yield yes now when we\ntalk about mandatory minimums that is\nwithout any chance for parole is that\ncorrect\nah\nso it depends it depends on the crime it\ndepends on the sentencing so if as far\nas the gang activity portion goes and\nthis is gang activity if you're a leader\nif you're recruiting so there are\ndifferent things that the judge is going\nto look at in order to factor in the\nsentencing portion and so if the if the\njudge decides to minimize that they will\nhave to go through certain requirements\nto see whether or not the accused fits\ninto that category or not in order to go\noff of the mandatory minimum sentencing\nand the judge has to put on record why\nthe judge did not follow the minimum\nsentencing if you are recruiting on\nthose that are under 17 there is no uh\nthere is no going off of the mandatory\nminimum no no chance at all for parole\nduring the mandatory management and if\nin fact the judge did decide to go to\nthe maximum of 10 to 20 they would in\nthat would not be any that's correct any\nchance for parole as well that's correct\nall right thank you thank you\nI do the lady yield representative\nRoberts right out in front of you is\nrecognized for our question thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the gentle lady I do\num in this bill you talk about\nrecruiting is 17 and under is that\ncorrect does it distinguish a recruiter\nwho is actually under 17 themselves no\nit doesn't and we\num and I think that it's good that we\ndon't distinguish that because then you\nare opening the gate for gang members to\nactually use those that are under 17 in\norder to recruit in order to continue\ngetting activity so this bill will focus\non those adults that are recruiting\nthose that are under 17. if you are\nunder 17 and recruiting those that are\nunder 17 they will be prosecuted under\nthe juvenile code as a juvenile\nokay thank you thank you\nlady further yield I will yield for one\nmore question Mr Speaker\nthe gentleman from\nthe 15th representative gamble has a\nquestion straight out in front of you\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentlelady\nyield I do\nis it not true that this bill is\ncodifying best practices of Judges\nacross the state in regard to issuing or\nbonds that is correct and somebody that\ndoes practice regularly in front of\nCourts I know that the judges do you\nlook at criminal history as well as any\ntype of bench warrants or failure to\nappears in the past\nis generally further yield I do is it\nnot further true that this bill does not\npreclude a judge from issuing an or Bond\nand insures to the public that at the\nvery least a judge has reviewed the most\nrelevant information applicable to an\nindividual's Bond determination that is\ncorrect and it does state that the judge\nMay so correct thank you\nthank you Mr Speaker I um respectfully\nasked for a yes vote on this bill and I\nyield the well\nthe lady has yielded well\nwe have some folks in favor and some\nopposed representative Tonya Miller is\nrecognized for up to 30 minutes\nrepresenting Miller\nthank you\nthank you Mr Speaker good afternoon\ncolleagues\nI stand before you today to speak\nagainst the passage of Senate bill 44.\nas a former federal and state prosecutor\nand current defense and civil rights\nattorney I have spent more than 20 years\nbelieve it or not\non the front lines of our Criminal\nJustice System working to make\nneighborhoods safer\nby ensuring that both criminals and our\njudicial system are held accountable now\nbefore I get started on my rationale for\nasking you to oppose Senate bill 44. I\nwant to give you a hypothetical just so\nthat it's really clear what the\napplicability of these mandatory\nminimums will do\nlet's say for example there are three\nyoung men 17 years old who get together\nfor the purposes of committing crimes\nthat's essentially all it takes to be\nconsidered a criminal street gang in\nGeorgia three or more people who\nassociate or organize for the purpose of\ncommitting crimes now those crimes do\nnot have to be violent\nthose crimes can be misdemeanors\nthere is a possibility that people will\norganize or associate to commit crimes\nthat are not violent so just put a pin\nin that as I share this hypothetical\nthree boys let's say they're from my\nneighborhood Grant Park right I'll use\nmy neighborhood so it's not putting one\nelse's neighborhood on blast\nthese three boys call themselves The\nGrant Park Boys\nthere are three seniors at Jackson high\nschool and they like to get together to\ntag or do graffiti on buildings they\nthey do smiley faces and they do it on\nlockers they also like to get together\nand pull their money after school\nto buy marijuana now let me stop there\nbecause I want you to know that nothing\nin my comments is meant to endorse any\nof this Behavior criminal Street gang\nbehavior is bad it is wrong and it is\nsomething that we ought to actually come\nup with policies that combat against\nbut let's just stick with this\nhypothetical for a second\nthese three 17 year old boys have just\nviolated Georgia's gang act which by the\nway is the most robust\nthe most comprehensive and the most\npowerful in all of the United States\nthere is no dispute about that\nmy Grant Park Boys get arrested my Grant\nPark Boys get charged with participating\nin criminal Street gang activity\nthose boys will each face a mandatory\nminimum sentence of five years in prison\nto serve in the Department of\nCorrections\nfive years to serve\nnow let's say one of those 17 year old\nboys\npulls his 16 year old cousin to come\nalong with them when they pull their\nmoney together to buy some marijuana to\nsmoke at one of their houses\nnow that 17 year old boy who has\nrecruited someone under the age of 17 to\nparticipate in criminal street gang\nactivity that's 17 year old boy excuse\nme that 17 year old boy is facing a\nmandatory minimum 10 years to serve in\nthe Georgia Department of Corrections\nthis bill\nis too inflexible it is too broad and it\ndoes not do what we actually need to be\ndoing to keep our communities safer and\nby the way that 10-year mandatory\nminimum sentence\nnobody has the discretion to reduce not\nthe prosecutor and not the judge\nso that 17 year old boy\nno matter what his previous condition is\nbefore getting arrested\nwe'll be going to the Department of\nCorrections under this bill that will be\nlegal in the state of Georgia\nunder SB 440s penalties\nwe are not doing the best that we can to\nget at what it is that we all really\nwant to get at and that is the most\nviolent offenders in our community\nviolent criminals must be held\naccountable nothing in what I'm saying\nto you today is meant to undermine this\nprinciple\nI say this as having been a person who\nprosecuted violent felonies for more\nthan a decade murders\nrapists child molesters I can tell you\nthat I have seen in my career on the\nfront lines of our Criminal Justice\nSystem the worst of the worst\nI have made sure that people have gone\nto prison for the rest of their lives\nwhen the facts and the law require it\nso understand this position is not one\nthat comes out of a place of softness or\nnaivety\nnaivete however we say that about what\nis happening\nin our Criminal Justice System Senate\nBill 44 is wrong\nbecause it won't make us safer\nthis bill will move our state backwards\nsolely for the the the purpose of\nappearing\nfor appearing to be tough on crime\nso when it comes to Public Safety I give\nthis bill an f and let me tell you why\none this bill strips flexibility away\nfrom our Superior Court judges\nthis bill is not supported by facts\nand what is actually happening in our\ncommunities as it relates to the\nrecruitment of young people into gangs\nhere is a news flash\nthere's not some big homie from La\nthat's taking a plane to Georgia\ncreeping around playgrounds\nand recruiting teenagers to become\nmembers of the Gangster Disciples\nit is far more likely that the people\nwho are recruiting children into\ncriminal street gangs are themselves\nchildren\nso if we really care about saving our\nkids if we really care about doing what\nis best for the most vulnerable among us\nwe ought to vote no against this bill\nand we ought to get down to the business\nof doing the things that stop kids from\njoining gangs in the first place\nthis bill fails to implement\nevidence-based strategies actually\nproven to prevent children from being\nrecruited into gangs and making us safer\nnow I know this is not a popular\nposition to take\nit is not difficult to stand up here as\na former prosecutor\nas a person who ran on\ncommunity-centered public safety and\ntell you to vote no against this bill so\nI'm going to spend some time explaining\nto you and to the public why I think\nit's so important that we do\nfirst of all this bill lacks flexibility\nwhat does Senate Bill 44 say to our\nSuperior Court judges\nThe Gatekeepers of Justice in our state\nthe people who actually see defendants\nand victims and hear all the facts in\nany given case\nSenate Bill 44 suggests that those\ncurrently holding the political power\nbelieve that they know better than any\njudge how to best affect Justice in any\nparticular case\nit is sometimes worth reminding\nourselves that the separation of powers\nis enshrined in our state's Constitution\nfor good reason\nthe separation of powers is crucial to\nour democratic form of government\nit works to prevent the concentration of\npower in any one branch and it provides\nfor those checks and balances that we\nlearned about in eighth grade social\nstudies\nin one way this bill would strip\nsentencing power away from our judges\nand give it to prosecutors so there are\ntwo sentencing Provisions in this case\none makes any criminal street gang\nactivity offense whether the people are\ncommitting violent crimes or not a\nmandatory minimum five years to serve\nthat's the first part\nthe second enhanced enhanced enhancement\nwould make the recruitment of a 17 year\nold by any person including a minor\na mandatory minimum 10 years to serve\nfor which there is no deviation\nand so I want to correct something and\nmake it clear before I go any further\nbecause there will be circumstances\nunder which\npeople who are 16 and who are 15 and who\nare 14 if they are charged as adults in\nour criminal justice system\nthey will be subject to the same\nmandatory minimum sentences as adults\nlet me say that again to be clear\nthere are mechanisms in our law\nto charge people as young as 14.\nas adults\nthere are mechanisms in our law\nto move to remove children from juvenile\ncourt and have their cases adjudicated\nin Superior Court as young as 14.\nthose kids\nif they are also accused of recruiting\nsomeone under the age of 17 will be\nsubject to these mandatory minimums in\nour current judicial system as this bill\nis written\nbe clear on what you're saying today if\nyou vote Yes to this bill\nnow while the first part of the sentence\nthe mandatory five for any criminal\nstreet gang activity can be reduced by a\nprosecutor if they choose to do so it's\nin their sole discretion\nokay\ncan be reduced by a judge but only under\nvery limited circumstances\nthe judge can depart from the five years\nafter seven I think it's six or seven\nfactors are met and they all have to be\nmet and the judge does not have the\nability to say well six of the seven are\nmet so I want to I want to depart or\nfour of the seven are met I want to\ndepart that is why this statute as\nwritten is so inflexible and I've\nalready told you that on the recruiting\nelement of it there is no deviation from\nanybody\nour laws need to be flexible enough they\nneed to be nimble enough to allow us to\ndeal appropriately with the most violent\nAmong Us\nand to restore and rehabilitate the ones\nthat we can\nthis bill robs our criminal justice\nsystem of this carefully crafted balance\nand my friends this balance is important\nit is critical to making us safer\nthis bill is not based on facts\nit wasn't so long ago that Governor deal\nestablished the Georgia Council on\nCriminal Justice Reform with the\nblessing and support of this body\nGovernor deal realized that the way our\nstate was handling Crime and Punishment\nneeded to be rethought both from a human\nand an economic perspective over a\nfive-year period the Council on Criminal\nJustice Reform conducted a comprehensive\nreview of every aspect of our state's\ncriminal justice system\nthat comprehensive review led to a\nseries of reforms to our Criminal\nJustice System including this is some\nnot all\nreducing some non-violent felonies to\nmisdemeanors which of course decreased\nthe population in our prison\nincrease the number of accountability\ncourts from 3 to 150 which take in\nveterans the mentally ill and those\nsuffering from addiction\nwho have committed non-violent crimes\nand connects them with the appropriate\nwrap-around services that they need all\nunder the supervision of a court all for\nthe purpose of diverting them from our\nprisons\nthese reforms reduce the rate of\nrecidivism and the number of\nincarcerations dramatically now this is\npre-covered because I think once you\ntalk about covid the numbers start to\nskew a little bit as they have all\nacross the country\nbut from 2009 to 2018 the number of\noffenders sent to sent to Georgia\nprisons dropped by almost 20 percent\nbased on just these reforms\nand the number of black Georgians who\nwere imprisoned dropped by 30 percent\nall of this was done in good faith by\nGovernor deal by the Supreme Court\nJustice chief justice Boggs and all of\nthe members who participated with with a\nfocus on public safety\nwhich led to an overall drop in our\ncrime rate because the reforms focused\non Redemption Rehabilitation Fair\nsentencing and appropriately saving our\nresources for the worst offenders Among\nUs\nwhat we are witnessing here today\nsome might argue\nis an attempt to assert to usurp the\nauthority of our judicial branch\nfor the purpose of what appears to many\nto be political grandstanding\nthere are some who believe that signing\nthis bill into law would send a quote\nstrong leader strong message to gang\nleaders\nto paraphrase a message we have heard at\nthe highest levels of our state\ngovernment\nyou come after our children and endanger\nour communities we will come after you\nthat certainly sounds tough\nbut what actually does this bill propose\nto do\nto do in reality affirmatively to\nprotect our children\nSenate Bill 44 is too clunky it's too\ninflexible it provides no safeguards for\njuvenile offenders who often become\ninvolved with gang activity as a result\nof other juveniles\ninstead of adopting evidence-based\nstrategies seeking to prevent violent\ncrimes including strengthening\neducational wraparounds for poor\nstudents at home interventions that have\nbeen proven to help poor kids who lack\nParental Guidance and support at home\nhousing support for children who are\nexperiencing homelessness I cannot tell\nyou how many folks out here join gangs\nbecause they don't have anywhere else to\ngo\nthey are literally hungry\nthey are literally stealing Vienna\nsausages from gas stations\nemployment programs for our young people\nincreased access to programs proven to\nreduce gang involvement by strengthening\nmentorship programs\nthis bill\nprescribes a one-size-fits-all approach\nthat is heavy on prison and light on\nHope\nnow gangs and gangs gang violence are a\nserious problem and that absolutely must\nbe addressed it must be addressed and\nthere are ways to do it we must focus\nour deterrent efforts on the few the few\nwho are causing the most problems we\nmust be smart about how we utilize our\nresources to focus on the most dangerous\namong us we cannot continue to keep\npainting with a broad brush because the\nsound bites\nmake hay for us back home\nany serious attempt to address the\nproblem of children being recruited into\ngangs must begin with tackling the root\ncauses\nwe know which children are most at risk\nat becoming involved with the gang let's\nsave those children\nLet's help those children let's\ninterrupt the process of gang recruiting\nin a meaningful way it's not a mystery\nthe primary factors\nare child abuse and neglect\nacademic problems disciplinary problems\nat school\na lack of Parental involvement\npoverty hunger and homelessness\nalcohol and drug abuse\nand of course mental health problems\nwhen children are acting out it is not\nbecause something is inherently wrong\nwith them it's more often because\nsomething has happened to them\nwe are most often seeing the impact of\nquote adverse childhood experiences\nliving in a state of poverty in and of\nitself is deemed\nin adverse childhood experience\nchildren and young people join gangs for\nmany reasons their brains are still\ndeveloping remember this conversation\nfrom last week\nabout how 17 year olds just don't have\nthe mental capacity to know what's best\nit's not certain 17 year olds it's all\nof them\nit's the nature of being a 17 year old\nor a 16 year old or a 14 year old or a\n15 year old\nthey cannot and often do not make wise\nchoices anybody ever raised a teenager\nespecially in the absence of positive\nrole models and Alternatives in their\nlives\naccording to the most recent data from\nkids count twenty percent of all\nchildren in Georgia 20 percent of our\nprecious children in this state\nthey're still precious right\n20 percent of our children in Georgia\nare living below the poverty level of\nthose 20 percent half are living in what\nis defined as extreme poverty\nif we truly truly want to address\nviolent crime and gangs and interrupt\nthe lifeblood which is in fact the\nrecruitment of young children we cannot\nand should not ignore this connection\nmany young people many ask any\nprosecutor or defense lawyer or social\nworker or judge many young people join\ngangs because an older sibling or a\nneighbor is involved in the Gang\nthis bill is disproportionately more\nlikely to harm teenagers and minors with\nslightly older siblings or family\nmembers who might be associated with\nthese gangs\nare we as legislators really prepared to\ntake the responsibility for these\nunintended consequences for 14 and 15\nand 16 and 17 year old kids being sent\nto prison for mandatory minimum terms of\n10 years\nwithout regard to whether or not they\nactually did anything violent\nthis bill will eradicate the backstop of\njudicial discretion and in some cases\nprosecutorial discretion\nplease read it closely\nas I stated in my hypothetical the 17\nyear old who recruits the 16 year old\nto tag buildings and smoke marijuana\nwould not have the ability to have a\nprosecutor or a judge reduce that\nsentence\nour judges should be trusted to do their\njobs\nto hear all case facts and to provide\nsentences appropriately\nif they don't we should trust the voters\nto remove them\nor the judicial qualifications\ncommission to discipline them\nwe as legislators should not substitute\nour judgment for theirs in these very\nfact-specific important determinations\neach individual case is different\nand is made up of different facts people\ncircumstances it's the duty of our\njudges they get a lot of practice at it\nbelieve it or not\nto weigh all of these factors and to\nconsider them in the sentencing process\nit is a fact that this bill should it\nbecome law will disproportionately\naffect people of color\nit will disproportionately affect people\nof color\nif we are sincere about protecting all\nof our children\nfrom being recruited into gang\nmembership then I emphatically ask you\nwhy or not we why are we not willing to\ndo more to invest in proven gang\nprevention programs that would benefit\nthese very children\nlet's invest time and resources in\naddressing the factors that make these\nchildren vulnerable in the first place\nthat make them Prime targets to be\nrecruited or enticed into gang\nmembership\ninstead we are about to spend Untold\nsums of money locking the door\nindiscriminately on their Futures we\ncould do so much more in this state to\nensure that the children in Georgia\ndon't feel the need to join a criminal\ngang we know that 95 percent of a\nchild's brain development happens within\nthe first five years of life let's talk\nabout some of the things we can do\nbefore the child reaches the age of\nkindergarten why are we not providing\npre-kindergarten for all Georgia's\nchildren\nwe know that the number of quality rated\npreschool providers in our state is\nwoefully inadequate for our population\nin over half of the 159 counties in\nGeorgia there are fewer than 50 percent\nof the daycare providers that meet\nquality rated standards\nhow many of you are aware that only\nabout five to seven percent of all\neligible families in our state receive\nsubsidies for child care\nfrom the Georgia Department of early\ncare and learning due to a lack of\nfunding and resources what does this say\nabout how much we truly care about our\nquote most vulnerable\nchildren\nwe know the quality after we know that\nquality after school programs keep our\nyoung people out of trouble\nand out of the reach of potential Bad\nactors in our community yet there are a\nquarter of a million Georgia children\nwho are at home unsupervised during\nafter school hours every day due to a\nlack of funding for programs in their\ncommunities that would provide for\nafter-school care\nanother primary purpose of sb-44 I keep\nwanting to call it 440 that was another\ns Bill SB bill\num\nas expressed by the supporters is that\nit will be an effective deterrent to\ncriminal gang activity we've talked\nabout this debate about whether or not\nmandatory minimums are actually an\neffective determine deterrent to\ncriminal gang activity or to crime in\ngeneral\nI'm going to let you in on a little\nsecret it's probably not one that a lot\nof you don't know especially if you\nworked in our criminal justice system\npeople who commit crimes\nespecially children who commit crimes\nhave no clue about what we do down here\nthey don't know penalties\nhow can they be deterred by something\nthat they don't even know\nmany of them don't even understand the\ndifference between a public defender and\na prosecutor\nwhen they get into the courtroom\nI've actually had to explain that to\nchildren that I've represented\nGeorgia already has as I stated before\none of the most robust anti-gang\nstatutes in the entire country\nand it has been in place for many many\nmany years\nwe're probably number one in terms of\nlegislation combating ganks\nyet our anti-gang laws have not deterred\ngangs from taking root in our community\nwhy because it takes more than just\npassing laws\nas a Fulton County prosecutor as I told\ny'all I served in both the crimes\nagainst women and children in the\nhomicide unit\nagain this is not me being naive\nbut we just have got to understand and\nrealize\nthat there has to be an ability for the\nfolks who are working on the front lines\nto have flexibility when we lock the\ndoor and throw away the key\nwe must always remember that that is not\nthe end\nthe offender is still connected to the\ncommunity that offender will most often\none day return to the community and the\nlonger they've been incarcerated the\nharder it is to re-enter them into\nsociety the more difficult it is for\nthem to become productive members of\nsociety to get housing to get jobs to\nnot recidivate\nthis does not make us safer\nwith one out of every 18 adults under\nsome form of Correctional control\nGeorgia has the highest rate of\nCorrectional Supervision in the country\nto put this in perspective\nGeorge's rate of Correctional control is\n73 percent higher than that of\nPennsylvania the state with the second\nhighest\nbeing tough on crime requires more than\nstanding behind a microphone and saying\nif you come for our children will come\nafter you\nwe have a systemic problem in our\ncommunities where gang violence has\ntaken hold it is rooted in poverty it is\nrooted in fear and it is rooted in\nhopelessness local communities should be\nincentivized to come together bring all\nstakeholders to the table and create\nplans that will work to prevent violent\ncrime these plans must be both law\nenforcement LED and Community centered\nand led by the folks in our community\nmy distinguished house colleagues I\nimplore you\nto question why we are departing from\nthe path Governor deal placed us on in\n2011.\na national model for successful Criminal\nJustice Reform initiatives a path that\nled to lower rates of incarceration and\nthus saving tax dollar money\ntaxpayer money\na path that led to\n1729 people graduating from Georgia\naccountability courts in 2017 alone with\neach graduate producing over 22 000 in\neconomic benefits and savings to the\nstate in all more than 38 million\nbecause we were able to divert\nwhen it's appropriate\nwhen we are flexible\nwhen we operate based on facts and this\ninformation came from the Georgia\nUniversity of Georgia Carl Vinson\nInstitute\nin summary\nthis is what we should be focused upon\nin this body continuing down the path of\nproven Criminal Justice Reform work\ninvesting in solutions that are based\nupon evidence and facts I implore you to\nreconsider your support of how of Senate\nBill 44 especially if your true intent\nis to solve the problem of young\nchildren being recruited into gangs let\nus take on the hard work of really and\ntruly supporting our most vulnerable\nour children one of five of whom are\nliving in poverty in our state let's\ntackle the root issues of poverty and\nhopelessness by investing in Resources\nby investing our resources in the\nprograms we know that make a difference\nin terms of preventing our children from\neven being enticed by a gang in the\nfirst place\nand let us get back on the path that we\nhave deviated from\nthe one that is proven to be effective\nand to save taxpayer dollars thank you I\nyield Mr Speaker\nthe lady has yielded the well\nwe will now have up to 30 minutes for\nthose who want to speak in favor of the\nbill\nrepresenting Barry Fleming is recognized\nto speak\nSenate Bill 44 representative Fleming\nthank you Mr Speaker and members of the\nhouse I rise today in support of Senate\nbill 44. and arise to tell you some real\nlife examples of why this package of\ngang anti-street game legislation that\nwe've been working on now with Governor\nKemp's leadership really does work and\ntell you some stories about that the\ngovernor's floor leader asked me to come\nand share the information with the whole\nhouse that I did with the house\nJudiciary Committee when we debated the\nvery bill that's right before you now to\nunderstand what I'm about to tell you\nyou need to understand the geography of\nthe part of the state that I come from\nif you look at the map of Georgia over\nnear the greater Augusta area you will\nsee that the area we call the CSRA the\ncentral Savannah River area is really\ntwo metropolitan areas that act together\nas one you've got the Augusta side with\nColumbia County and the surrounding\ncounties of close to half a million\npeople and then right across the\nSavannah River you've got the South\nCarolina portion of our metropolitan\narea close maybe to a quarter of a\nmillion people Aitkin County North\nAugusta that area the two communities as\nI said usually work at one socially\nbusiness-wise if you're an attorney you\nquite often practice in both States\nbecause your client doesn't care where\nyou practice he wants you to handle this\nbusiness for him well unfortunately the\ncriminal gang system that we're fighting\nover that works the same way too\nfor the longest time they didn't care if\ntheir business was on the South Carolina\nside or the Georgia side until recently\nand something changed and that's what\nI'm here to tell you about with Governor\nKemp's leadership over these past few\nyears as we have focused on cracking\ndown on street gang crime in Georgia it\nreally has made a difference and let me\ngive you the example\nin Georgia over in the guest area for a\nwhile we had a local prosecutor and a\nfederal prosecutor that worked well\ntogether and they took these tools that\nwe have given them through these\nanti-street game and they started going\nafter these street gangs it got so bad\nthey said that when you would arrest the\ngang members and bring them to be booked\nthey would say man don't gang me man\ndon't gang me now what does that mean\nand they're slaying that means they\nunderstand that when they get arrested\non the Georgia side the ability to put\nthem behind bars for what they've done\nand keep them there away from our kids\nand our other family members that are\nbeing harmed was much more significant\nthan they had been arrested on the South\nCarolina side also South Carolina\nofficials were talking about the rise in\nthe gang activity on the South Carolina\nside and directly relating it to fact\nthat the gangs got smart and they were\nmoving out of the Augusta area across\nthe Savannah River to South Carolina\nbecause it was a easier for them to do\nbusiness there and it was easier for\nthem to get away and not get punished as\nseverely for some of the horrendous\nthings that they were doing in our\ncommunity ladies and gentlemen of this\nhouse that is a real life example of how\nour focus on anti-streak gang laws and\nwhy Senate Bill 44 fits in there is\nexactly the right way forward to us to\ngo anybody that stands here from this\nwell and tries to tell you that this\ndoesn't work all you need is a couple of\nprosecutors who will do it the good news\non that is that we have passed laws to\nallow now our attorney general to step\ninto areas of this state where we have\nweak on crime prosecutors that won't use\nthese gang laws that we've passed and\nladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell\nyou from my own Community this stuff\nwill and does work when you use it I\nurge you to once again vote Yes for\nSenate Bill 44 another part a great part\nof the governor's package of cracking\ndown on gang crime in this state Mr\nSpeaker I yield the well\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nMajority Leader illustration is\nrecognized\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker ladies and\ngentlemen of the house I just felt\ncompelled to come up here and and talk\nwith you about this bill here today I\nrecall the old saying\nyou're entitled to your own opinion but\nyou're not entitled to your own facts\nand I unfortunately think that the what\nwe've heard from the well\nearlier today is just inconsistent with\nthe facts\nand I like to really focus on the\nlanguage that's in the bill and really\ntalk to you as a former prosecutor\nmyself and the experience that I've had\nobserving the criminal justice system\nearlier today we heard in this bill we\nheard debated that it's too inflexible\nrepeated too inflexible the judge has no\ndiscretion\nif you actually look at the bill it does\nprovide discretion line 93 in the\nCourt's discretion a judge May depart\nfrom the mandatory minimum sentence\nand I really hope is this legislation is\ncovered\nthat it's covered according what to\nwhat's actually in the bill\nnot what folks say remember say here in\nthe well\na judge is authorized to depart from the\nsentencing guidelines if the judge makes\nhis determination that it's appropriate\nand then if the judge\nline 105 to 106 the judge shall specify\non the record the circumstances for the\nreduction and the interest served by\nsuch departure so the judge and his or\nher discretion in the courtroom can take\na look at the facts that are involved in\nthe case and do what's best to serve\nJustice\nso any assertion that a judge's hands\nare tied here by legislators is just\ninaccurate\nnow another issue was raised that\nthe criminal Georgia Council on Criminal\nJustice Reform\nwas not supportive of mandatory minimums\nor work to remove those from the statute\nI served on that Council for several\nyears\nand I'll just tell you you can look at\nthe state of our law\nmandatory minimums were not repealed\nunder the Council on Criminal Justice\nReform now in fact the primary objective\nof the Criminal Justice Reform Council\nwas to make sure that Public Safety was\npreserved as we really went at some of\nthe underlying causes such as addiction\nand Drug crimes\nwe didn't repeal mandatory minimum\nsentences no what's happened is that\nterm has now been used as a buzzword to\ntry to attack legislation\nand what we have put into the law is\nProvisions such as the one in this bill\nto allow judges the discretion to do\nwhat's right under the circumstance the\njudge is closest to the facts\nnow additionally As I understood what\nwas said earlier from the well there was\nan assertion that\ntime could not be paroled\nI even checked when I heard that when I\nunderstood that to have been said to to\nverify if Senate Bill 44 is enacted\nGeorgia Board on Pardons and paroles\nwill still make determinations as to how\nto grid these offenses\nwe're not doing anything as far as\ntaking away the power to consider\nthose convicted of being eligible for\nparole that is still retained even if\nthis bill passes here today\nso you're entitled to your to your own\nopinion but you're not entitled to your\nown facts and if you look at the\nlegislation that's presented here today\nthis goes after a very serious criminal\nEnterprise issue in our state criminal\nstreet gangs it's been estimated\nestimated or connected to\nover 50 percent of all violent crime in\nour state and a way to address it is by\ngetting aggressive doing it in an\nappropriate manner having sentences\nreflect the severity of the crimes\nbut this also does so while preserving\nflexibility for judges within the\ncourtroom\nand maintaining the Board of Pardons and\nparoles Independence to consider whether\nparole should be eligible in certain\ncases I'd encourage your support of\nSenate Bill 44 and Mr Speaker I yield\nthe well\nthe gentleman has yielded the well we\nhave another speaker\nchairman Knight is recognized and speak\nto the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI don't come often to the well\nbut when things affect our communities\nlike gang violence\nand you know it is it's affecting\nGeorgia\nevery day we get up\nand we watch the news and we watch\nanother shooting another drive-by\ne and we hear people killed\nwe hear of even our fellow\nRepresentatives get up and they they\ncome to the well and we've recognized\nthe death\nof innocent people\nbecause of drug I mean gain violence\nwell it is home\nit hits home even in Griffin\nand I heard the initial speaker who got\nup here and and gave eloquent\num\ntestimony of why we shouldn't vote for\nthis bill and it was about protecting\nthe most vulnerable our children\nwell let me tell you what happened in\nGriffin a couple years ago and it just\nwrapped up in a trial\nback in July of 2020\nsome gang members\nplanned an armed robbery to be able to\njoin\na local game\nand they drove up to the apartments\nand the victim opened the door\nthey attacked the victim\nand they shot him in the back of the\nhead\nand they robbed him\nbut his fiancee and his two small\nchildren\nwere also in an apartment\nand again this was a recruitment and\nthis was a gang initiation\nRDA\nwho prosecuted this and thank God that\nshe's standing up for the innocent\nfamilies and for these children who now\ndon't have a father\nshe said I'm going into schools\nand she's seeing the first-hand impacts\nof gangs and what they're having on the\nyoung people\nacross the state it's not only the\nthere's two children who lost a father\nbut it's the very innocent people that\nyou want to protect\nand she said\nthat she's seeing children 10 11 and 12\nyears old being recruited\nin the gangs\nand she said that the cooler case was a\nclear example of the type of recruitment\nexplaining that the one or the other\ndefendants who got convicted was\nrecruited at the age of 12 years old\nand that the shooter\nwas 19. during this reported initiation\nand it was overseen by an older 26 year\nold leader\nif we want to protect the most\nvulnerable\nlet's first of all think about the folks\nwho are either getting killed or they're\nlosing loved ones children parents\nbut if you really want to look at the\nmost vulnerable let's look at those\nchildren who are being\nput into gangs and let's get rid of the\npeople who are out there recruiting them\nI urge you to support this let's think\nabout the so think about the two\nchildren that don't have a dad anymore\nbecause they were recruitment into games\nand the gang violence that is plaguing\nthe state thank you Mr Speaker\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair has\nknown that previous question is ordered\nthere is a Minority Report\non Senate bill 44.\nwhip Park\nyou ready\nis recognized as the first Speaker I\nthink and he will allocate time and he\nsaid as he sees fit for up to 20 minutes\nwe'll park\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI rise in opposition to Senate bill 44.\nI appreciate the intent of this bill\nall of us all of us want to protect\nchildren\nall of us want safer communities\nwe all want to take actions to prevent\ngang violence\nhowever just like the bill we debated\nthe prior legislative day where the\nintent was to protect the children even\nthough the actual effect would be to\nharm children which is why the Georgia\nchapter of the American Foundation For\nSuicide Prevention testified in\nopposition to that bill\nI agree with my learned colleague\nrepresentative Tanya Miller that this\nbill will do more harm than good\nsb44 would not make us safer rather it\ntakes us backwards because it is not\nbased on the facts and it fails to\nimplement evidence-based strategies\nactually proven to prevent violent\ncrimes\nrather than protecting children and\nbuilding safer communities for all\nGeorgians that requires long-term\ninvestment in people\nthis bill will directly harm children\nunder this bill youth pressure to commit\ngang crimes will be incarcerated for a\nmandatory five to twenty years for line\n61-66.\nyouth who recruit other youth will be\nincarcerated for up to 25 years\nincarcerated for up to 25 years for line\n67 to 85.\naccording to the U.S department of\njustice Office of Juvenile Justice and\ndelinquency prevention Children and\nYouth often report joining a gang for\nprotection and they are most likely to\nbe recruited by their friends once a\nyouth is in a gang however they face a\nhigher risk of becoming a victim of\nviolence those threats of violence\nincrease the likelihood a youth will\ncommit a crime\nduring periods of active gang membership\nagain we're talking about minors here\nwe're talking about children\nthe average age at which a child joins a\ngang is 15 years old\ncurrent Georgia law ensures that youth\nare subject\nto sb44's punitive sentencing scheme\nso not only will children be harmed by\nsb44 this bill will not protect children\nfrom Criminal gang activity which\nrequires a comprehensive multifaceted\ncollaborative approach that involves\nprevention intervention and suppression\nstrategies\ncolleagues what matters more than your\nintent for a piece of legislation is its\neffect\nthe impact it will have on the problem\nwe are trying to address\ny'all we live in the information age not\nthe Stone Age\nwe have the capability of researching\nstudying and understanding what policies\nwork best to address the shared problems\nwe face\neven though we have that intellectual\ncapacity it remains a matter of choice\nand character as to whether or not we as\nlegislators demonstrate the wisdom and\nhumility necessary to find and Implement\nthose policies that serve the best\ninterest interests of Georgians rather\nthan doubling down on failed policies\nthat are politically expedient\ncolleagues mandatory minimum sentences\nare failed policies they are failed\npolicies and that is not my opinion and\nthis is also why so many of my\nDemocratic colleagues are so strongly\nopposed to mandatory minimums in this\nbill and in other pieces of legislation\nas it was heard just a few moments ago\nwe are not we are all entitled to our\nopinion but not\nthe facts\nI urge y'all\nto look at lines\n75 to 77 80 to 82 and 83 to 84.\nit makes clear that there are multiple\nmandatory minimum sentences in this\npiece of legislation that shall not be\nreduced suspended or otherwise departed\nas my colleague representative Tanya\nMiller accurately described this bill\nthere is limited limited discretion in\nwhich a judge would have to clearly\ndemonstrate five to seven conditions\nthat can then be appealed\nby the state court\nthis bill is\npossibly going to lock up children in\nthis state for up to 25 years that's\nwhat you're voting on\nmandatory minimum sentences are again\nfailed policies they fail to deter crime\nthey disproportionately harm people of\ncolor and they fail to promote Public\nSafety\nGovernor Nathan Deal understood this\nunder his leadership Georgia became a\nleader in Criminal Justice Reform and so\nit is unfortunate to see his hard work\nand his legacy undermined by pieces of\nlegislation like this and so many others\nthat seem more focused on sending a\npolitical message rather than doing the\nhard work to keep all of us safe\nnow again it's not a mere opinion\nthat mandatory minimums are failed\npolicy one of the best studies on the\nineffectiveness of mandatory minimums is\na report by the United States sentencing\ncommission\nthe report found that mandatory minimum\nsentences did not have a significant\ndeterrent effect on crime and did not\nreduce recidivism rates\nthe report also found that mandatory\nminimums resulted in disproportionate\nsentences for people of color and\nlow-level offenders that's a report from\nalmost a decade ago\nanother study published in the Journal\nof criminal law and criminology in 2016\nanalyzed the impact of mandatory\nminimums on drug offenses in the United\nStates again\nno significant effect\nlet's continue again these are all\npublicly available studies a national\nresearch Council found that mandatory\nminimums had no clear impact on reducing\ncrime or improving Public Safety that\nreport again almost from a decade ago\nrecommended that lawmakers consider\nalternatives to mandatory minimums such\nas evidence-based sentencing practices\nthat take into account the individual\ncircumstances of each case\nnow there have been several studies\nspecifically conducted on the impact of\nmandatory minimums on gang violence and\nparticipation\none study by the University of\nCalifornia Los Angeles found that\nmandatory minimums did not reduce gang\nparticipation or violent crime\nthe study looked at the impact of\nmandatory minimums on gang-related\ncrimes in California and found that\nthere was no significant difference in\nthe number of gang-related crimes before\nand after the implementation\nof mandatory minimums\nare clear my colleagues\nmandatory minimums are ineffective\nthis bill will lock up more kids\nmandatory minimums are not not an\neffective way to reduce gang violence or\nparticipation\nas my colleague again further noted\nthere are clear unintended consequences\nassociated with mandatory minimums\nmultiple studies again done on policies\nenacted throughout multiple States over\nthe past few decades\nthese unintended consequences range from\nincreased violence to prison\novercrowding that will only continue to\nsupport\nthe private prison industrial complex to\nthe detriment of Georgia taxpayer\ndollars\nwe have to take steps to address these\nproblems at its root\nrather than putting a bandage trying to\nmerely address the symptoms\nGeorgians deserve more than tough on\ncrime messaging and mere intentions\nwe need real evidence-based policy\nsolutions to reduce gang participation\nand violent crime\nsb44 is not it\nsb44 will do more harm than good\naccordingly I urge my colleagues to vote\nno to sb44 thank you Mr Speaker I yield\nthe well\ngentlemen has yielded the well the chair\nrecognizes representative Willis to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you madam speaker\ngreetings honorable colleagues\narise today in opposition to Senate bill\n44.\nthere's intent\nand there's impact\nlet us not pretend that we do not see\nthe connectivity in all things\nit is blatantly obvious that access\nbegets progress and sustainable success\ngang violence is a fruit issue\na lack of opportunity\ninequality and systemic prison pipelines\nare in fact the root\ngang violence is the fruit of resource\ndeserts\npoverty\nand although I absolutely appreciate\nproposals that fully fund QBE\nmore concretely gang violence is a\nresult of underfunding public education\nby 10.2 billion dollars since 2003.\nputting Georgia 38th in the nation in\nper student funding\nas we tout being the number one place to\ndo business\nas written these enhancements in sb44 do\nnot prevent crime\none in five Georgia children are living\nbelow the federal poverty level\nwith half of those living in extreme\npoverty\nfor years my colleagues and I have\nproposed a state-earned income tax\ncredit to help lift Children and\nFamilies out of poverty\nwhat evidence-based anti-poverty\nmeasures has this body enacted\nwith the billions in Surplus thanks in\npart to austerity Cuts before the\npandemic and federal stimulus dollars we\ncan and we must do more to be good\nfiscal stewards of taxpayer dollars to\nin fact build safer communities\naddressing gang violence at its root\nrequires comprehensive and sustained\napproaches that involve multiple\nstakeholders and effective strategies\nSolutions\ninvesting in education\nstrengthening community-based programs\nproviding Mental Health Services\nsupporting Law Enforcement Training\nefforts addressing poverty and\ninequality and providing job training\nand employment opportunities\nwe must attack the root\nto impact the fruit\nthese strategies are interconnected and\ncannot be implemented in isolation\nwe must work together to address these\ncauses of gang violence and build safer\nand healthier communities for each of us\nand all of our districts\nimposing more mandatory minimum\nsentences is not the answer\nGeorgians deserve more than rhetoric\nthey deserve more than pageantry\nwe need real\nevidence-based policy solutions that are\nproven\nto reduce crime\nchildren make mistakes\nthe issue is that many people don't view\nthese children as children at all\nSB 44\ncauses irreversible harm to a generation\naccordingly I urge my colleagues each of\nyou to contemplate that fact and vote no\nto SB 44. thank you madam speaker are\nyou at the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nrepresentative Roberts is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI'm going to start with a quote\nAmericans from across the political\nSpectrum can unite around prison reform\nlegislation that will reduce crime while\ngiving our fellow citizens a chance at\nRedemption any idea who said that\nlet me tell you it was former president\nDonald Trump when he signed the first\nstep to act into law this quote was\nfeatured in an article published by the\nNolan Center for Justice Just last month\nthe Nolan Center was established by the\nAmerican conservative Union Foundation\nto provide leadership for the growing\nconservative consensus that our criminal\njustice system is badly broken and that\nthere are proven conservative reforms\nthat will keep the public safe while\nrestraining costs and for those who\ndon't know what the acuf is it's one of\nthe nation's oldest organizations\nrepresenting Grassroots conservatives\nthroughout the United States found in\nmore than five decades ago and it works\nto advance conservatives core values of\nLiberty personal responsibility and\nfiscal responsibility all of which are\nimpacted by Criminal Justice Reform I\ndon't think any of us here disagree that\nincarceration is often required for\naccountability General deterrence or\nkeeping dangerous people off the street\nbut the Nolan Center clearly points out\nthat incarceration for incarceration's\nsake makes no sense it burdens taxpayers\nharms families Hollows out our\ncommunities and impacts the economy\nso\nthis article also went on to mention our\nvery own Governor deal in a list of\nconservative leaders who supported a\nsmaller and more effective Criminal\nJustice System their successes show that\nwe can lower crime and incarceration\nrates at the same time if done properly\nso just five months ago in October 2022\nleading National pollsters venison\nstrategy group and public opinion\nstrategies conducted a poll to\nunderstand voters views on Criminal\nJustice Reform and how they feel about\ncandidates that support policies that\nwill safely reduce the number of people\nincarcerated in jails and prisons\nconsistent with past polling new public\nopinion research shows that Republican\nvoters continue to support Criminal\nJustice Reform and are more likely to\nvote for candidates that do as well\nso for efficiency I'm only going to read\nthey broke it down between total GOP\nvoters and very conservative gops\n62 percent of very conservative voter\nsupport Justice Criminal Justice Reform\nsixty percent of very conservative\nvoters believe it is important to reduce\nthe jail and prison population\nas far as impactful policy changes to\nsafely reduce the jail and prison\npopulation 78 percent of very\nconservative voters support allowing\npeople\nin prison to earn additional time off\ntheir sentences for following prison\nrules and participating Rehabilitation\nprograms\nokay\num the biggest one is 62 percent support\neliminating mandatory minimums and other\nsentencing laws that require a long\nprincess rather than allowing judges to\ndetermine the appropriate punishment\nbased on the facts of this case so\nthe this last election in 2022\nthis week on crime Theory worked but it\ndidn't actually work for your base so\nI'm trying to understand we're about to\nincrease our budget from 2022 to 2023\nthe Georgia Department of Corrections\nincreased the budget\n154 million and from amended FY 23 to\nthe proposed 2024 there's an additional\n81 million in proposed budget taxpayers\nare going to bear this cost of rising\nprison populations dozens of Decades of\nresearch show these policies will not\nmake us safer think about what we could\ndo with those hundreds of millions of\ndollars to actually put it in the\ncommunities and help these kids rather\nthan sweeping them up in unnecessary\nlegislation that will not work so listen\nto your own voters and vote your\nconscience\nrepresentative Kennard is recognized to\nspeak to the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker I rise in\nopposition to sb-44 this isn't a matter\nof uh smart on crime or soft on crime or\nhard-on crime not soft don't cry my\nheart on crime but being smart on crime\nand I mean that in the most literal way\nI checked our most recent Department of\nCorrections uh statistics and the\nmajority of folks locked up in our state\nprisons dropped out of school their\nschool dropouts another 38 percent went\nto 12th grade or have a GED\nnine percent or less have some college\nand a microscopic 1.8 percent of those\nwho have a four-year degree represent\nour prison population\nless than two percent of our prison\npopulation is a four-year degree uh\nholders\nso what I'm trying to communicate is\nthat the greatest tool in our Public\nSafety toolbox is higher education we\nget our more Georgians through college\nwith a four-year degree we almost\neliminate them from the possibility of\nbeing incarcerated\nuh also we understand the connection\nbetween literacy rates and potential\nincarceration we know that kids not\nreading on a third grade level are\nhighly more likely to have an\ninteraction with uh Corrections did you\nknow that we spend fifty four hundred\ndollars to put a Pre-K student through a\nyear of state-funded pre-K do you know\nhow much we spend to incarcerate an\nindividual per year that number is 27\n000.\nthe average Senate served is five years\nyou do the math 27 times five that's 135\n000 we're spending on the average person\nto incarcerate them we can take one year\nof that twenty seven thousand dollars\nand put someone through a four-year\ndegree in one of our college and\nuniversity systems so what I'm saying to\nyou is that a smarter Georgia is a safer\nGeorgia and for that reason I'm opposing\nthis bill we should be thinking about\nhow we can get more folks in our Pre-K\nright now 60 of our four-year-olds are\nin pre-k let's move that up to uh 100 I\ngot a fiscal note on that it would cost\nabout 250 million dollars and that would\nto put every four-year-old in our Pre-K\nsystem that would uh be the cost of\ntuition teachers and the capital outlay\nto build more to build more classrooms\nand Early Child Learning Centers so\nlet's reinvest let's rethink what we're\ndoing a smarter Georgia is a safer\nGeorgia thank you\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat concludes our Minority Report we'll\nmove on now to the chairs time up to 20\nminutes\nchair of the committee chairman Tyler\nPaul Smith is recognized to speak to the\nbill\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield part of the\nChairman's time to Chairman Rob Liberty\nrepresentative Rob liver has recognized\nto speak to the bill\nthank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr\nSpeaker\nuh my father practiced law with judge\nRobert M Hurd for many many years a\nformer member of this body\nand he used to tell me Robert whenever\nyou're given a legal opinion\nit's usually a good idea to look at the\nlaw once in a while\nI would say the same is true when we\nconsider legislation a lot of a lot of\nopinions have been expressed and I\nrespect the opinions of the folks who\nhave spoken from this well\num I I I I truly do\num\nI would just suggest when we look at the\nat the bill it doesn't seem to me to\nhave quite the wide ranging effect that\nhas been described\nthe bill makes limited amendments to the\nto the gang statute\nspecifically it increases the penalties\nfor recruiting a young person or a\nperson with a disability\nand it does admittedly do that it it it\nmakes them a good bit stiffer and it\ndoes limit the discretion of the judge\nin some cases to depart from that of\ncourse it doesn't do anything to the\nBoard of Pardons and parole's ability to\nparole or probate some of that sentence\nthat cannot be done uh constitutionally\nit also does provide avenues for a judge\nto depart from these these penalties in\nsome circumstances\num but I I want to address an issue that\nhas been raised today about the notion\nthat we can do more I I agree\ncriminal gangs have become a scourge of\nour society they have multiplied lately\nthey're not just in urban areas they're\neverywhere they're in my district a\nrural District I share a part of\nRepresentative Flemings County and we've\nheard from law enforcement down there\nhow pervasive they are and how\naggressive they are in committing crimes\nand recruiting young people\nas it has been said that's that's sort\nof their life's blood\nand so this this statute tries to\naddress that through an enhanced penalty\nand if you don't believe enhancing\npenalties has any effect then then I\nprobably have lost you but I do believe\nthat is part of a sound strategy for\naddressing this issue I agree we can do\nother things and we should nothing in\nthis bill prohibits us from taking other\naction I I agree we need a more holistic\napproach and this doesn't preclude that\nbut I do believe part of the approach is\nstiffening penalties for people who\nrecruit children into gangs we need to\nget tougher with them we we're tough\nalready but we need to get tougher there\nneeds to be a a proportional response to\ntheir action and and as representative\nFleming said it\nthe evidence to me is that when you take\nthat stance when you get tough with them\nconsistently when you go after them you\nbegin to beat them back and this this\nstatute will give prosecutors a tool to\ndo that\nnow\na bit has been said also about\nthe impact this will have on children\nwho are recruited in The Gangs because\nit has been said and I believe it to be\ntrue that sometimes the recruiters are\nthe children who just got recruited\nthey're recruited for the purpose of\nrecruiting\nand I think that does happen I wouldn't\nquestion that\nbut keep in mind nothing in this statute\nchanges the rules on transfer of cases\nfrom juvenile court to Superior Court\npeople under 17 are still likely to be\ntried in juvenile court there is a\nprocess where cases can be transferred\none way the other there's also a process\nwhere DA's can transfer cases down to\njuvenile court if they think that's\nappropriate but nothing changes what I\nview to be the strong policy and\npresumption in our law that favors\ntrying those under 17 in juvenile court\nnot in Superior Court and if they're in\njuvenile court\noh the minimums and the mandatory\nsentences in here are not going to apply\nanyway they're going to be sentence\npursuant to the statutory framework for\nsentencing juveniles\nso I would keep that in mind when you\nreview\nthis this bill I I don't believe it's\ngoing to have quite the severe of the\neffect that has been characterized\nagain it just changes the penalty for\nrecruitment it generally leaves\nuntouched the 5 to 20 penalty that\ncurrently exists for most violations of\nthe gang statute\nit also does allow for the departures\nand that's to be done on an in-camera\nhearing to protect the person who's\ngetting the departure from any any kind\nof Revelation to the members of the gang\nand of course it does address bonding\ntoo but I believe all of this is a\nconsistent cohesive package that is part\nof a measured approach to attacking the\nevil of gangs in our society I urge you\nto vote for this bill I don't believe\nit's going to have a lot of the\nill-intended effects that have been\ndescribed and I believe it's a\nconsistent and smart part of any\ncomprehensive approach to combating gang\nactivity it simply does not prohibit all\nof the other approaches which I agree we\nneed to to employ but I think this is a\na vital part of that strategy and I\nencourage you to vote this so\nprosecutors can have this tool to combat\nthis great evil\nthank you Mr Speaker\nthe gentlemen has yielded the well\nthere is a little time left on the\nChairman's time\nchairman Smith has recognized\nto speak to us further on the bill\nchairman Smith\nthank you Mr Speaker\ntoday I rise in favor of Senate bill 44.\nyou know I was reminded Mr Speaker and I\ncould hear it just going over in my head\nthe Waylon Jennings song Don't You Think\nThis Outlaw business has done got out of\nhand\nand uh just for y'all's information we\nreferenced Waylon Jennings in our\nCommittee hearing\nyou may think I'm crazy but Waylon\nJennings\nhad Hells Angels that would fall around\nhim as he did a tour as his personal\nbodyguards\nnow\njust so you know being a member of a\ngang\nunder current law and under this law\nis not a crime\nit takes a Nexus\nbetween breaking another statute and\nfurthering the purposes of a gang\nactivity\nI've heard a lot of Criminal Justice\nmeasures that have been brought before\nboth of these bodies at this point\nand you know I'm always\nmindful\nof Genesis chapter 3 the fall\nthe fall of humans and the banishment\nfrom the Garden of Eden\nI see it all the time but not just\nGenesis 3 with the fall of humankind I\nsee Genesis 9.\nthe noahic Covenant\nand we talk about the morality\nand how we can\nhow we can or we cannot legislate\nmorality\nwhat do you think we got our murder\nstatues\nnow\nin particular you look at this\nlegislation\nthis legislation\ndeals with those that are recruiting\nthose that are 17 years of age or\nyounger we've all got laws on the books\nto deal with juveniles who have decided\nthey want to cross that threshold of\nadulthood and start acting like an adult\nwe already have those statutes on the\nbooks but what we're talking about\nis the corruption of our youth\nnow look I agree with you there's a lot\nof folks in jail right now\non certain offenses\nthat I think should have been released\nor bonded out by now there's some\noffenses\nthat they're just being held there\nbecause maybe the prosecutor's got a\npersonal Vendetta against that person I\ndeal with it all the time\nI'm probably one of the only members\nhere\nthat has ever defended gang members\nthere's few\nrepresent pan it shows I know there's\nseveral others of you here\nand I can tell you\nthey have always always been just so\nnice to their counsel\nbut you read about what they do and in\ncounseling these people it's tough let\nme tell you you're dealing with human\nbeings\na lot of times remorseful\nagain I'm dealing with Genesis chapter 3\nhere in the fall\nI'm dealing with fallen and broken\nhumankind\nas we all are right here today\nand you look at this and so many times\nthey say Only God can judge me\nI was like well yes he is the final\njudge when this all winds up for us\nbut let me tell you read over in Peter\nand you talk about having abide by a\nman's law\nwhat this bill in particular will do\nis take those that are recruiting our\nyouth 17 years of age or younger\nyou are going to have them off of the\nstreets for 10 or 15 years\nlike I said a while ago I agree with you\nthat's folks sitting in jail right now\nthat need to be bonded out they\nshouldn't be there\nI'll be the first to lead the charge on\ngetting those folks out so we can put\nthe worst of society these gang members\nthat are recruiting our youth into those\nspots I'm all for it\nwe as a society\nhave to legislate\nwhat is right and what is wrong we have\nto determine what is right and what is\nwrong\nthis bill right here\nmore than any other that has come to my\ncommittee is one of personal\nresponsibility\nI've seen a lot of stuff that just\nmake an offense lawyer and want to go\njust pull his hair out\nbut you know I was reminded of this\nquote from the judge starring Robert\nDuvall and Robert Downey Jr\nand this phrase has stood out in my mind\nfor a long long time now\nin my practice\nand then having to discuss things with\nclients so you'll see that there's a\nbail provision in this bill nobody\ntalked about it hardly\nand you know I looked at it\nand I cannot tell you how many\nconversations I've had with clients\ntelling them\nthis is not a dentist appointment\nthis is not going to the doctor you can\njust reschedule it\nwhich\ndoc Newton I always make sure I go to my\ndoctor's appointments because I respect\nthe time\nit's like no this is the institution to\nwhere you don't show up you get bench\nwarrant you get to go spend some time in\nthe county hotel but this quote I want\nto leave with you here today\nit goes as far as you're standing in one\nof the last great cathedrals in this\ncountry built on the premise that you\nand you alone\nare responsible for the consequences\nof your actions\nthere has to be personal responsibility\nthis bill brings that personal\nresponsibility back Mr Speaker\nwith that I'm going to yield the well\nand ask this body's favorable\nconsideration\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nthat completes\nall the time we had allocated\nis there any objection to adopting the\ncommittee's substitute the chair here\nhas none The committee's Substitute is\nadopted is there any objection to\nagreeing to the report of the committee\nwhich was favorable to the passage of\nthe bill the Jerry has done if the port\nof the committee is agreed to shall this\nbill now pass all in favor of the\npassage of the bill we'll vote Yes all\nthose opposed will vote no and the clerk\nwill unlock the machine\nfor what purpose does leader Beverly\nrise moved Lee uh Senate Bill 44 on the\ntable\nthe gentleman's moved to\nlive\nMr leader I'm\nunderstanding that per the rules of this\nhouse after the vote is open that is not\na prop appropriate motion\nfor what purposes representative Roberts\nrise parliamentary inquiry State inquiry\nthank you Mr Speaker uh isn't it true\nthat if\nwhat representative Miller told us that\nGeorgia has one of the most robust gang\nlaws in the country and\nif representative Fleming who I know\ntold the truth said that gangs are\nfleeing to South Carolina isn't it true\nthat that means the existing laws on the\nbooks are working and this is overkill\nthank you\nI'm sure the lady believes in what she\nstates\nfor what purposes represented Miller\nrise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nMr Speaker isn't it true that under SB\n44 a mandatory minimum sentence imposed\npursuant to the paragraph relating to\nthe recruitment of minors quote shall\nnot be reduced suspended or otherwise\ndeparted from pursuant to paragraph four\nor five of this subsection those are\nlines 83 through 85 and paragraph five\nreferences the Court's discretion so to\nbe clear Mr Speaker is it not true that\na judge cannot depart when the\naccusation is that an individual has\nrecruited a minor\nif the gentlelady so States\nfor what purposes represented\nrepresented Petrie rise\nparliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker stay\ntuned Mr Speaker it's not true that just\nless than a year ago the Fulton County\nD.A stated that gangs were responsible\nfor nearly 75 to 80 percent of violent\ncrimes in Atlanta\nI'm sure the gentleman believes what he\nso States\nwhat purpose does representative Chas\ncan unrise\nhe waves\nfor what purposes represent Lisa\nCampbell rise\nparliamentary inquiry State inquiry\nisn't it true Mr Speaker that the\nBrookings Institute recently researched\nand found that in states that

more\nfor what purposes represent the\nappendage rise\nparliamentary inquiry State your inquiry\nisn't it not true that as representative\nTyler Paul Smith said I'm a criminal\ndefense attorney and that many of us\ncharge more depending on the length of\nsentence that could be imposed if\nconviction if there's a conviction\nI'm not sure how y'all charge\nmy brother's choir it's usually a lot\nbut yes\nmay I further inquire\nState your inquiry and is it not further\ntrue that even though I would have a\nfinancial incentive to vote Yes on this\nbill because I could charge more for\nmore

of this\nbill street gang terrorism and\nprevention act sounds like a great idea\nand something that our communities need\nbecause unfortunately many of them have\nbeen negatively impacted by this\nviolence however as we heard today the\nconversation is not that gang violence\nis not a bad thing or not a problem it\nis that the solution we are pursuing is\ngoing to harm a lot of

true that\nI spoke in Noel the other day regarding\nmy nephew that was shot in Savannah in\nthe head\nbut as I look at this this bill today is\nit not true that we as members of this\nhouse should listen to what is being\nsaid as it not true as I look at this\nthere is no Democratic side that is\nquotes put on here as voting for this\nbill is it not true that this should be\nsent back\nto the house or to the Senate to ask for\nsome changes as they better affect what\nis happening in our community\nwe had a reduction in Savannah in gang\nrelated by getting working together\nshouldn't this if we are going to vote\non this today shouldn't we have\nsome things up there that said that this\nwas a decision that was made by both the\nDemocratic and the Republicans in this\nhouse and that we do not have to follow\nwhat is happening on the other side of\nthe hall thank you\nif the gentlelady so States\nhave all members voted\nhave all members voted if so the clerk\nwill lock the machine\non the passage of the bill the yeas were\n99 the Nays 74 the bill having received\nthe requisite constitutional majority is\ntherefore passed\nMr clerk will you read the caption to\nSenate bill 61.\nwe're moving on to supplemental calendar\nthat was set this morning Mr clerk\nSenate bills 61 Senate Bill 61 with\nSenator Strickland to the 17th to be a\ntalent act to amend code section 34 110\nfor the official quoted George annotated\nrelaying the use of sick leave for care\nof immediate the family members so as to\nrepeal the sunset provision relating to\nsuch sick leave requirements this bill\never referred to the committee on\nindustry and labor that committee\nrecommends that this bill do pass\nrepresentative Daniel is recognized to\npresent the bill\nthank you Mr Speaker\nI'm so excited to bring something I hope\nwe can all agree on after our couple of\nhours of debating that important\nlegislation today I Rise to bring Senate\nBill 61 which was carried by my\ncounterpart on the other side\num Senator Strickland this bill is a\nwonderful piece of legislation that will\nend at the sunset clause and the Family\nCare Act which was passed with\nbipartisan support and the legislature\nback in 2017.\num the bill before you doesn't tell you\nwhat that is so I did come prepared to\ntell you what the Family Care Act does\nit simply allows employees who already\nearn paid sick days to use up to five of\nthose days per year to care for a sick\nloved one it does not require employees\nto offer any additional paid sick days\nbeyond what they already provide their\nemployers\nuh let's see\nthis law has been in effect for the last\nsix years and it has shown that it is\nsomething that's good for employers and\nfamilies in our state and so we believe\nat this time it would be a good move to\nremove that sunset provision and\num\nseed\nwhen it was originally introduced it had\na three-year provision so this would be\nthe second time that we would be\nextending it and so they have actually\nchosen to just remove it all together\nand I think this is a good move for us\nas we continue the efforts to make\nGeorgia the best place to live work and\nraise our families so I asked for your\nfavorable support and will yield the\nwell if there are no questions\nyou have no questions\nthe lady has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered chair here's none\nthe previous question is ordered is\nthere an objection to agreeing to the\nreport of the committee which was\nfavorable to the passage of the bill\nchair here's none the report the\ncommittee is agreed to shall this bill\nnow pass all in favor of the passage of\nthe bill we'll vote Yes all those\nopposed will vote no and the clerk will\nunlock the machine\n[Music]\nfor what purposes represent these Samson\nrise\nhe weighs\nhave all members voted\nif so\nthe clerk will lock the machine on the\npassage of the bill the yeas were\n172 the Nays were one the bill having\nreceived the requisite constitutional\nmajority is therefore passed Mr clerk\nwill you read the caption to Senate bill\n990.\nthe Senate Bill Noni by Senator Dixon\nthe 45th and others to be entitled back\nto amend chapter one of title 10 of the\nofficial go to George annotated relating\nselling and other practices so as to\nprovide for commercial financing\ndisclosures this beloved referred to the\ncommittee on Banks and banking that\ncommittee recommends that this bill do\npass\nby committee substitute\nthe gentleman from the 118th is\nrecognized representative Crowe to\npresent the bill\n[Music]\nthank you Mr Speaker colleagues this is\nSenate Bill 90 as I stated it is a\nrevenue-based uh\nfinancing provision that uh allows for a\ncurrent form of finance and that many\nsmaller medium-sized businesses use when\nTraditional Bank Loan is not the best\noption this may sound familiar to you uh\nrepresentative Rhodes earlier in this\nsession had House Bill 84 which\nessentially did the same thing that\npassed out of this house and was sent\nover to the Senate this is a senate\nversion uh companion bill that they had\ncoming back\nuh in addition to that portion though we\nhave a portion added to it in the\nsubstitute that was a bill that I had\nHouse Bill 471\nand House Bill 471 dealt with some\npredatory real estate practices\num\nMidway through 2020 Georgia began seeing\na new real estate predatory practice\ntypically a scenario would go something\nlike this homeowners offered cash as\npart of a homeowner program in reality\nthe homeowners coerced in an area\n40-year listing agreement uh for their\nhome the listing agreement Then followed\nthe clerk's office and a covenant\nrunning with the land for those 40 years\nso when them or particularly their heirs\nwould inherit it trying to sell the\nproperty there'd be a cloud on the title\nand they wouldn't be able to sell the\nproperty unless they paid that company\nuh percentage typically three percent of\nwhatever they decided the value of that\nproperty was in order to sell the\nproperty so it's\nit's currently estimated that there are\nas many as 7 000 of those currently\nrecorded in the state of Georgia what\nthis portion of the legislation seeks to\ndo is to cut off the at creating\nmore of those it would establish it as a\nas an action listed uh in the fair\nbusiness Practices Act of 1975 it would\nstop them from being able to record\nthose or be used as a cloud against the\ntitle and then sections one or uh sorry\nsections three\nuh four and six would deal with\num wholesalers these are the folks that\nsend out a notice saying they want to\nbuy your home and actually they want to\nget a listing or a\noption to buy your home and then go out\nand Market that and what they're trying\nto do is avoid real estate license your\nlaws and prohibitions against net\nlistings so they want to get it under\ncontract so they can Market it and then\nsell it for an increased amount and keep\nthe difference between those so\nthat's what these this bill is seeking\nto do on both those accounts Mr Speaker\nand I will answer any questions if folks\nhave those\ngentlemen yields for a question I do\nrepresentative Jasmine Clark to your\nleft has a question representative Clark\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield yes all right so we did discuss\nthis but I wanted to know if you got an\nanswer to the question line 103 the bill\nstates that a commercial financing\ntransaction that's more than half a\nmillion dollars\ndoes not this this bill would not apply\nto them do you ever find out why\nyes ma'am um and and much like the other\nquestion you had which is why it was uh\nmore than five transactions that's the\ncutoff that they decided to put in here\nmost of these transactions are going to\nbe between fifty and a hundred thousand\ndollars very rarely are they even going\nto go over two hundred thousand dollars\nso uh it's very unlikely that there\nwould be any that would go over 500\nbecause it is a risky proposition to to\nlend that amount of money so that was\nthe the cut off when they tried to\nnarrow down this portion of the law does\nthe gentleman throw the yield yes ma'am\nand then further down on lines 118\nthrough 120 it talks about they're only\nneeding to be one disclosure even if you\nwere to change or basically modify or go\nthrough a forbearance or change the\nfinancing commercial financing\ntransaction are there any concerns about\num the people who are being financed you\nknow if there was a change there's no\nrequirement that they have to do a new\ndisclosure for that right and it does\nsay that it's uh a disclosure is not\nrequired as a result of modification\nprevails or change to a consummated\ncommercial transaction so that would be\none that had already been consummated so\nI guess I didn't see a need to need to\nredisclose that it's already been\nconsummated\nthank you thank you gentlemen further\nyield yes sir representative Roberts to\nyour left in front of you thank you Mr\nSpeaker does the gentleman yield I do uh\nisn't it true that the latter part of\nthe bill uh that I was a co-sponsor and\nthat this\num predatory practice among these\ncompanies uh being a licensed realtor\nmyself and a real estate lawyer it is\npraying on our most vulnerable our\nelderly Community they are looking\nthey're in Desperate situations they\ntake 700 cash and don't realize that\nthey are locked into a covenant running\nwith their land for 40 years that's\nexactly right and typically from what\nthe the\ninvestigations have shown into some of\nthese is that these folks are typically\ntargeting uh elderly and lower income\nhomeowners the folks that would be more\ndesperate to to seek out something like\nthis\nno further questions thank you Mr\nSpeaker\nwill representative Becky Evans is\nrecognized to speak to the bill\nMr Speaker colleagues today I Rise to\nsupport Senate Bill 90 but also to\nexpress concern that it not it does not\ngo far enough to protect these Legacy\nhomeowners from deceptive business\npractices\nwhich I know is important to all of us\nwe need to pass legislation that\nprovides for disclosure requirements\nfor wholesale buyers and sellers of real\nresidential real property we need to do\nmore to Define and regulate wholesale\nsellers\nlines 178 to 208 are fine in terms of\nsome kind of transparency but they don't\nreally do anything to combat deceptive\nreal estate wholesalers they're only\nrequired to disclose that they're\nsoliciting but not the fact that they're\nsimply an intermediary between the\nseller and buyer not the actual buyer\ndisclosing their actual intent\nis the most important piece in my\nopinion\nalso I didn't see that a deceived seller\nhas any recourse to terminate the\ncontract on their home\ncurrently wholesalers are permitted to\noversee real estate transactions with no\nlicensing training or education\nrequirements\nit's the Wild Wild West and they're\nplaying with people's homes\nit's no accident that if you run a\nGoogle search for Real Estate\nwholesaling Georgia\ntwo of the first results that come up\nare questions about whether or not it's\nlegal\nthere's an article that I want to tell\nyou all about that illuminates what uh\nwhat representative Crowe and\nrepresentative Roberts have talked about\nwhere the wholesalers are taking\nadvantage of elderly home sailors\nit says the booming Atlanta real estate\nmarket may make some elderly homeowners\na Target\nhomeowners are selling their houses for\ntens and even hundreds of thousands\ndollars less than they are worth\none elderly woman\ncontacted Channel 2 after she sold her\nSouthwest Atlanta home for more than a\nhundred and forty thousand dollars less\nthan the Real Estate Zillow estimated it\nwas worth\nthe woman did not want to be interviewed\nand her name is not being used\nthe investigative reporter spoke with\nthe real estate broker who found the\nelderly woman on the side of the road\nwith her belongings while the\nwholesalers who bought her home cleared\nit out\nthe wholesaler listen to this the\nwholesaler would come to her house every\nsingle day and beg her to sell\nshe would say no then they started\nbringing her dinner then they started\nasking her if she needed her medication\npicked up from the pharmacy they\nbefriended her\nanother person got a call about a woman\nwho had just sold her home and needed\nhelp buying a condo\nshe didn't have enough money for a condo\nand she was almost 80 years old\nand so it's the West End by the Atlanta\nBeltLine it's the hottest juiciest\nneighborhood right now in Atlanta\nthe women's Southwest Atlanta home was\npurchased by Green Sky properties on\nJuly 30th of this year for ninety five\nthousand dollars\nthe same day green Sky properties sold\nthe home to Nigeria where for field for\na hundred and thirty thousand dollars\nZillow estimated the home was worth more\nthan two hundred and forty thousand\ndollars\nAtlanta Legal Aid attorney Sarah Stein\ntold gray that wholesalers typically\nshop for houses that aren't for sale\nStein said the wholesalers buying homes\nfor Less the market value and reselling\nthem to investors the same day as a\ncalculated technique\nthey are literally doing nothing to the\nproperty and selling it the same day to\nsomebody else for significantly more\nthe wholesale group that was involved in\nthe purchase of the elderly woman's home\nholds a weekly training sessions called\nwholesale live in Southwest Atlanta\nthe producer paid 35 dollars to attend\nthis session where the wholesale Live\nCrew had our cold call owners off Market\nhomes around the metro area\ntheir technique is not to take no for an\nanswer and to try to get homeowners to\nsign a contract on the same day\nthe wholesalers provide a script for\ncold callers\nif an attendees lead resulted in a\nsigned contract they would get a cut\nfrom the state\nit's like a boiler room atmosphere\neveryone is in here one room making\nphone calls\nwhen they went to the wholesale live\nsession to ask about their elderly\nwoman's home the organizer said the\nwoman approached their team about\nselling her home\nshe said my name's not on any documents\nWilliams is not on any of the home sale\ndocuments that the channel 2 reviewed\nbut her Instagram follows every step of\nthe purchase and renovation of the\nelderly woman's home\nWilliams and the fellow wholesale live\ninstructor appeared in a post a\ntestimonial video at the closing\nattorney's office on the day of the sale\nto talk about the Elder ones experience\nworking with the team\nthe elderly woman said they're like my\nchildren\nin other videos Williams documents the\nflipping process including inviting\nInstagram followers to a demo party to\neducate them on the renovation process\nof course guys when you acquire\nproperties especially directly from the\nseller and they've been in their house a\nlong time it's possible you may run into\nsome of these type of situations\nrecorded in the basement of the elderly\nwoman's home explaining that they would\nhave to remove 47 years worth of\nfurniture and other properties\nDavid Blake with Georgia's Department of\nHuman Services Division of Aging trains\npolice across the state to investigate\nelder abuse cases\nBlake told gray deceiving an elder to\nbuy their home in a bargain could be a\ncrime\nforeign\ntwo has not found evidence that the\nwholesalers are committing a crime and\nthat's what I hope our body might\naddress but in that an Atlanta police\nfraud investigator did contact the new\ncessation with questions on the case\nthe new station passed the investigators\ninformation on to the elderly woman's\nattorney\nwhether it was a crime or not the\nsituation the elderly woman was put in\nis wrong there's absolutely no doubt in\nmy mind that they took advantage of her\nso we need to do more I hope in our next\nuh legislative session to to be able to\nprotect these elderly people from abuse\nthank you Mr Speaker I yield the well\nthe lady has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair

bill\nthank you Mr Speaker seems like forever\nsince I've been here\num\nthis is the last bill so I will be brief\non this I know y'all all have other\nplaces to be and other things to do as\ndo I so\num Senate Bill 93 uh\n[Music]\nwell a little feedback Senate Bill 93 is\na technology bill passed 50 to nothing\nin the Senate and what it does is it\nprohibits the use of social media on\nstate-owned devices when the social\nmedia platform is owned or operated by a\nforeign adversary or by a company which\nis domiciled in has headquarters in or\nis organized under the laws of foreign\nadversary uh\nspecifically Tick Tock in this instance\nbut that is the bill and I would stand\nfor any questions Mr Speaker\n[Music]\nGeneral yield I do\nrepresentative Jason Ridley from the six\nto your extreme right over here has a\nquestion president Ridley I just got one\nquestion how do you know where\nsomething's connected to\nso that uh\nI think that's my answer thank you sir\nyeah\nI don't think somebody wants me to\nanswer that question\num but anyway it would be determined by\nthe uh the director of the uh\nDepartment of Georgia Homeland Security\nDepartment\nand those foreign adversaries are listed\nby the federal government and updated\nthis will be updated on the list for\nJanuary 1st 2023.\nyep I think the sound system's getting\ntired I think that's what's going on it\nis I'll Stand way over here\nrepresentative Williams is recognized\nfor a question to your left take me\nspeaking\nthank you for the bill I think it's a\ngood Bill I'm just I'm a little confused\nI explain to me if we're going to knock\nTick Tock out of the business\nwe got a little boat yard in Savannah\nit's loaded down with Chinese materials\nand Americans can't get more they can't\nbreak the habit we take tick-tocks out I\nhelp you understand how we keep Logan\nChinese products into America\nWilson I I wish I could help you with\nthat I can't I can't answer that um and\nthis is not knocking Tick Tock out of\nbusiness on your personal device it's\njust on a state uh employees or students\non state-owned devices that it's being\nbanned from\nrepresentative Ramon is recognized for a\nquestion\nthank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman\nyield I do\num so it appears that there has been\nextensive conversation about Tick Tock\nbut is it not true that a lot of social\nmedia companies currently do track a lot\nof our data and do sell it to other\ncompanies so why this particular\ninterest in only Tick Tock and for the\nrecord I understand that we need to keep\nsome of these social media applications\noff our state devices but I am curious\nwhy this wasn't sort of brought into\nother\nTech related I think it's because of the\num\nthe fact that it's it's owned or\ncontrolled or overseen by a foreign\nadversary in this case uh China and so\nand again it's not trying to prohibit it\nfrom your personal device this is just\ntrying to make sure that our state-owned\ndevices that are used by state employees\nand students are secured\nand Tick Tock like I said it's this is\nspecifically targeting those social\nmedia sites that are owned or controlled\nby a foreign adversary\nas determined by the federal government\ngentleman yield for another question\nI'll take one more Mr Speaker\nrepresentative sains chairman sayings to\nyour left\nto the gentleman yield I do this is not\ntrue that this bill is specific to the\nestate devices to ensure that our\ncitizens data is kept secure and however\nthe larger conversation on on the\ndistinction between data security and\nthe the youth Health in terms of social\nmedia usage is part of a broader\nconversation that can be addressed but\nis not part of this bill\nyes sir that is exactly correct\nand with that Mr Speaker I will yield\nthe will and ask for this body's\nfavorable consideration\nthe gentleman has yielded the well\nis there any objection to the previous\nquestion being ordered the chair hears\nnone the previous question is ordered is\nthere any objection to adopting the\ncommittee substitute the chair hears\nnone the committee substitute is adopted\nis there
