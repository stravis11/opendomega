  "transcript": "Well, good morning everybody. Thank you for being here. What a great day it is to be at the Capitol beautiful weather and an opportunity for us to honor some hard-working Georgians that take care of us in our most sincere times of need.\nFirst Lieutenant Governor, thank you for being here, sir. Appreciate you.\nMr. Commissioner.\nPrime Minister, thank you for being here.\nI was trying to remember your title,\nthe multiple you've had with all your service.\nSo thank you for that and the senators\nand our legislators that are here.\nFriends, today we're coming together to not just acknowledge\nbut deeply honor the quiet heroes among us,\nthe ones who work tirelessly,\noften at great personal risk to ensure\nthat our way of life remains uninterrupted.\nGeorgia's linemen are the backbone of our energy infrastructure,\ntheir braving storms, flooding, dangerous temperatures,\nand long nights to ensure that our homes are lit\nand that we stay safe and warm,\nand that our businesses stay open here in Georgia\nand our families remain safe.\nThey really are the steady hands\nthat bring light in our darkest hours.\nToo often, their work goes unnoticed.\nWe ride down the road and see them coming down the interstate,\ngoing to make sure that we are taking care of in a storm and we're so glad they're coming\nbut quite frankly after the storm passes sometimes our recognition of them does as well.\nAnd today is a day for us to say thank you even during the calm.\nYou know we drive past the power poles every day rarely stopping to think about what they\ndo for us but when disaster strikes and lights go out we sure do want them on our side\nin coming to our homes quickly don't we?\nRecently, we saw that in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\nYou know, we had winds that topped 125 miles an hour,\nthe storm ripped through Southeast Southwest,\nand so many parts of Georgia tearing down trees,\ndestroying the infrastructure,\nand the damage was devastating.\nAnd who were the folks that were the first ones\nto try to come take care of us?\nIt's the people that you see behind me.\nYou know, within hours, the linemen were on the ground,\nmaking sure that they were working alongside hundreds of utility workers and operators from\n12 other states just from this past hurricane that we had to make sure that our infrastructure\nwas put back into place.\nSome of these guys and ladies were at grueling 16 hour shifts going days without seeing\ntheir own families to make sure that us and our communities were being taken care of.\nYou know, for them it's not just a job, it is a selfless commitment to something that\nis far greater than just a job.\nI witnessed this firsthand not only going to see my little\nhometown, Adrian George of the day after the storm,\nbut also in Turing, Clinch County,\nin serving the devastation that Helene had caused.\nQuite frankly, what we also don't think of\nis this is one of the most dangerous professions in America.\nNationwide, Lyneman have one of the highest fatality rates\nranking among the top 10 most hazardous jobs in our country.\nThat's why, to use a March 11, 2025, we officially recognize as lineman's day here at the state\ncapital.\nA small but meaningful way to honor their unparalleled sacrifices.\nThese workers don't seek recognition while they're doing it or even afterwards, but they\nabsolutely deserve it and that's why we're here today.\nSo let's let today serve as a reminder for the critical role that they play in powering\nour state and our homes and the sacrifices they make to keep things normal for us.\nBut let's do more than just acknowledge the work that they're doing.\nLet's commit to supporting them, not just today, but tomorrow and in the days ahead.\nGeorge's utility providers are already working to strengthen infrastructure in order to mitigate\ndamages for future storms that we know are coming, but we don't know when or how severe\nthey're going to be.\nSo right now, I'm going to ask you to join me with some deep appreciation and gratitude\nto the men and women behind me who continue to put their lives on the line for us every\nday but especially in the most difficult times at our state faces so let's\ngive them a great appreciation let me ask our lieutenant governor if you'd\nlike to share any words with us thank you thank you thank you senator\nKennedy and I'll I just want to say thank you to the men and women here today\nday. For everything you do, we always reminded during the tough time how much this profession\nmeans to us and I just appreciate Senator Kennedy for taking this opportunity to recognize\nthese fine people here behind us and the hard work that they do. For all the various\ncompanies that they represent here today all across the state of Georgia and just appreciate\nyou making the opportunity and taking the opportunity and doing this senator and and if we can\never do anything for all of you guys here today please feel free to call on us at any time.\nSo thank you senator Kennedy and thank y'all for being here today.\nThank you.\nThank you.\n",
