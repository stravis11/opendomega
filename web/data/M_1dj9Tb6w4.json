So we're not in sunshine tomorrow. We'll be working for both. And so I hope all of you\nare just giving me just something everybody can be driving out of here. So with that,\nrepresented Skoggins, you want to tell us why you changed until you know\nanyone because we have heard this film last week and I know that you've worked hard on\nand get changes. I think, and I really appreciate your hard work.\nI appreciate your time.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nI remember this mail just.\nWhat it's doing.\nWe're trying to expand our lives from the matter.\nPlay a game, make more than a yard in shape.\nSo that's really.\nand this increases by the time that we're adding,\nif you're looking at the green and red again,\nthe transition to the system,\nthe last of the other January,\nwe're going to be doing a nurse practitioner\nor a medical nurse specialist\nthat is trained and sentenced to a 10-month-old.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much.\nI have a question about where the compliments are on that source of the nurse, the practitioner\non March 24, that there's practitioners who are a clinical nurse that is specialised\nin, so there's the nurse practitioner who has to have a psychiatric and mental health\na\nThe next question is,\nthe next question is,\nthe next question is,\nif you have any additional information,\npsychiatric,\nor mental health,\nor education,\noutside of what's provided,\nand on national program,\nyou all can read.\nThank you.\nSo, we're\nis\nbecause it seems to me that I'm sitting on the floor.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nUm,\nthis is intended to be a nurse practitioner.\nOh.\nLet him pull their specialists into specializes in that area.\nBoth are under chapter 26 of Title 43.\nIf you add an accommodate between a practitioner or.\nHe will have to somehow correct Spring Festival in Episode 4 and 3.\nOkay?\nSo, and I think that was intentionally written, written, written, if you know the next big marriage\nand Bayleigh Barebeach ends up on his extra visual transplant.\nThere was no tension on his additional weapon.\nHe's very sad to hear that, that, there's might change, actually change.\nWe can certainly let the council sign this is what we need to do there, but we follow\nour questions and we can be thinking about that for answering Senator Tharn's question.\nThis is reminding him not to share your questions, but I'm committing now.\nWe're talking about comments that we say about chairs for down the hour, but when the comments go,\nthat's a good day. I just want to sign the author and those who worked all this, I think it\nMuch adopt our entire\nand\nis\nUm, or as a draper I think that,\nbut, because it wasn't done\nof the possession assistant, or excuse me, the nurse practitioner, or the nurse specialist,\nand for consistency and the way the code is spreading the marriage, family, therapists, or confessional counts there.\nI can't agree, the Senator estimates, as it's about to tell the truth.\nIt sounds terrible, I'm sure, actually.\nIt's a little difficult to tell the truth.\nIt's about to tell the truth.\nIt's about to tell the truth.\nIt's about to tell the truth.\nIt's about to tell the truth.\nIt's about to tell the truth.\nSo any other questions?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's.\nIt's.\nIt's.\nIt's.\nAre you Mike?\nYes.\nDid you have another.\nI was going to ask to make a motion at the appropriate time, but I think Senator Jackson might\nhave a question. I'll ask it. Social work or licensed social worker does not have a title attached.\nI know that was in the original bill or original law. Do we know whether there should be some kind\nkind of chapter and title attached to that.\nStudents said we're aligning to talking to you.\n27.\nThe last is clinical. So yeah, so all the, all the.\nAll the.\nYeah, so we're not adding that. It's already there.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nWe do have some people signed up to testify,\nso let's go ahead and give them an opportunity.\nFirst, Aubrey, Elaine.\nThank you, Chair and members of the Midi Aubrey\nbehind the last professional council\nof the Association and the Advanced Practice Nurse\nis all wave unless there's questions.\nBe happy to answer any questions\nand I wrote the original bill years and years ago.\nJust for the record for me, please you support the bill.\nWe support the subject.\nThank you. That's what I needed to hear.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nOkay, Angie Smith.\nThank you Madam Chairwoman.\nI am the current chair of the license professional counselor,\nsocial worker, and marriage and family therapist composite board.\nSo I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.\nFrom a licensing standpoint or a training education standpoint.\nI'm not sitting on their lines.\nOh, I'll wait.\nSenator Jack wants to ask you a question.\nYes, just from a, thank you, Madam Chair.\nFrom a training standpoint,\nare these folks that you represent?\nDo you feel like they are trained in recognizing these types of competencies,\njust by nature of their schooling and training already?\nIs that inclusive?\nYes, ma'am.\nI do believe that.\nYes, ma'am, I do believe that the clinicians that are licensed by our board are competent to perform these evaluations.\nWe are already doing modified versions of this when we assess for lethality, we assess for risk.\nSo I believe that our clinicians are trained and prepared to perform these evaluations. Great. Thank you.\nThank you. Robin, you already spoke the driven thing\nelse to add. Okay. Elizabeth Appley?\nYes, Madam Chair, I represent the Georgia Association for\nMountain Family Tribune to support the bill and thank the\nauthor and appreciate it working with us on the sub. I\nhave Dr. Steve Livingston, a former board chair for the\ncomposite board available and Dan Upshaw and Brady\navailable to answer your questions. Thank you. Dr. Livingston, can you hear us?\nYep, I can hear you. Thank you for having me on virtual. I'm receiving an infusion as we speak.\nso please. Okay, can you hear us? Yes, yes. Did you have anything you want to add? I think you've\nbeen on there the whole time, so you've heard the conversation. Yeah, I just, you know, I agree with\nall the testimony. I'm the legislative chair of the Georgia Association for Marriage and Family\ntherapy and we support 291 this revision of it. And do believe that licensed\nmarriage and family therapists, professional counselors as well as\nsocial workers are all qualified to do this. I was chair of the board for\nfour years and a program director for Mercy University's marriage and\nfamily therapy program in the school of medicine. And I know that the\ntraining that marriage and family therapists receive is you know would\nqualify them to do these kinds of evaluations.\nAll three of us, professional counselor,\nsocial workers, and MFTs are credentialed\nto diagnosis and treat mental illness.\nWe all treat individuals, couples, and families.\nSometimes marriage and family therapists\nget the label of just being marriage counselors,\nbut we've been for 25 plus years in Georgia,\ntreating individuals, couples, and families\ndealing with a variety of issues\nand doing, you know, similar kinds of things.\nAnd all three disciplines on this board\nall are qualified to do this kind of evaluation.\nThank you.\nAny questions from the committee?\nOkay, that's everyone we had signed up to testify.\nAnd if there are no further questions,\nI'll entertain a motion.\nI move that we do pass.\nOkay, second by Senator Jackson, further discussion.\nOkay, all in favor raise your hand. Any opposed?\nOkay, thank you.\nBill passes. Who's carrying this for you?\nOkay. Thank you.\nOkay, next we have House Bill 144, this is hearing only we're not voting on this bill today. Representative Lewis Ward, are you ready?\nI'm heading.\nWelcome to the Senate. Thank you.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nWhat's that?\nI heard that.\nThis is the first time you've been before our committee is this isn't your first bill is it it is. Ah, okay. Thanks for sharing that\nOkay, go right ahead the floor that the new madam chair and members of the committee. I bring to you House Bill 144 LC number\n48\n0937 s\nThis is a constituency bill\nI'm about a year and a half ago constituent came to me\nOur brother was sick and his wife has stopped the family from allowing him to communicate with the family.\nHe eventually passed away on December 24th of last year and that's where we get the name the George Burgess Act from his name and honor for brother.\nWhen we took a look at the current code, the code does exist for a war to communicate freely\nwith anyone other than the guardian. But what this bill does, it just adds a little bit more\nof into the current code. And we did have some conversations with DHHS. They thought that there\nthere may be some conflict with the bill,\nwith the current code,\nand also with the representatives for the probate judges\nwe had a meeting with them.\nAnd they provided us with code\nthat they would prefer to see in the bill,\nand that's what we did the substitute\nbecause we put in their code in the bill.\nWe worked with legislative counsel,\nand we also believed that there's no conflicts\nwith the current code.\nSo section one, what it basically does,\nit just indicates some ways that the ward\ncan communicate with someone other than a guardian.\nAnd then section two is part D, line seven, things are 25,\nis the code that the pro-bate representatives\nask us to include.\nAnd really that's the bill.\nQuestions from the committee?\nOkay, we have one person signed up\nto testify Judge Keith Wood.\nCome on up.\nYou can just scoot over and let him get to the mic,\nif you would.\nGood afternoon.\nMembers of the committee,\nI wanna first thank you for the opportunity\nto be here to discuss this bill.\nAnd I want to start out by saying that.\nCan you tell us where you're from?\nSure, absolutely.\nI am from a lovely Cherokee County\nGeorgia on the probate court judge.\nI am, again, appreciative of Representative Lewis Ward\nfor putting forth legislation and having\na concern for the adult ward.\nCertainly, that's a concern as a probate judge.\nWe have as well.\nAnd when looking at a bill like this,\nIt's not that we have an issue with the idea\nthat we want to have the tools\nto deal with situations such as this,\nit's just that we already have those tools.\nThe language, even the substitute language,\ndoesn't really add anything to something\nthat we already have the ability to do.\nWhen you look at the statute,\nas it is currently structured, you know,\nyou have 29, 420, which sets out these rights\nthat award has, including the right to communicate\nwith people freely.\nThen you have the code section 29, 420,\nwhich says that the court and situations\nwere award is denied some right.\nThe court has the ability to investigate\nthe circumstances of that award\nand determine if something needs to happen.\nAnd then if you, when you look at code section 29452,\nit kind of sets out things that the court can do\nif we find cause.\nThose include revoking or suspending guardians letters\nrequiring additional security\nif they're required to be bonded.\nReducer deny compensation.\nImpose any other sanctions that we deem appropriate.\nIssue, and this is the one I always like,\nissue any other order as in the court's judgment\nis appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\nSo we have a really fairly broad ability\nto deal with situations such as this.\nQuite honestly, as a probate judge,\nif I have circumstances,\nand I've had these circumstances before,\nwe believe that award has been prohibited\nfrom communicating with others.\nQuite honestly,\nI'm gonna go to removing a guardian\nbefore I do anything else.\nI'm not looking to find them.\nI'm not looking to, you know, slap them on the risk.\nI'm looking to remove them,\nbecause that's a serious problem.\nIf, or in the alternative,\nthe court has the authority to set out things\nlike visitation plans and things of that nature\nthat can more directly address that problem.\nIt is not that I have an issue\nwith what this legislation attempts to do.\nIt's just, I think it's something\nthat we really already have the authority to do.\nAnd I don't want to muddy the water of something\nthat we already have, the authority to do,\nthat we can do, and that we actually already do do.\nAnd it's, you know, maybe this is a situation\nwhere it's a case where maybe someone didn't realize\nthat authority was there, but it's there.\nThank you, Judge.\nAny questions for Judge Wood?\nMr. Jackson?\nThank you, Madam Chairman, Chairwoman, so to be clear, you're saying that people who\nare awards are already supposed to be able to have visitations, telephone calls, emails\nand personal mail come to them that that's already existing in code.\nIs that what you're telling me?\nI guess it really depends on how you want to define the term communication.\nI define it fairly broadly.\nI mean, if someone tells me,\nyou know, I'm not allowed to have phone contact with a ward,\nI consider that, you know,\nthat violating the spirit of what that statute provides.\nI mean, you can, you can sit there\nand divine out what we mean by communication.\nAnd that's fine.\nI don't know that it adds or takes away anything.\nBut yes, I think that the court can already act.\nThe court already has the authority act\nin those circumstances.\nSo in your expert opinion, if someone were a ward\nand they wanted to have regular visitation from someone,\nif that were denied to them, you're saying\nthat they would have calls to come to court already\nif they were not allowed visitation with someone else.\nYes, absolutely.\nI think that that, and I think what the court\nis trying to do in those circumstances again,\nevery case is going to be different,\nbut I mean, you're weighing,\nYou know, you may have a situation where you have a ward that wants to have a visitation with someone who may have been a predator before.\nObviously, the court is not going to want such a circumstance, but that's what the court's there for is to evaluate the circumstances and determine what is appropriate.\nBut if it's a circumstance where the ward wants to have a visitation with a relative, and that's being denied, that's something the court should be addressing and has to address.\nThank you.\nSenator Robertson.\nThank you, thank you, Judge.\nJudge, would you say that when you deal with communications\non the vast majority of these,\nwhen you get down into the weeds on a particular case,\nwouldn't you say that there's more times\nthat you're specific in limiting communication\nbased on some of the things you just said\nas far as a predator and predator,\nwe don't necessarily mean sexual.\nWe talk about financial predators and others\nthat attempt to take advantage of these individuals,\nbut on most of them, when you say communication,\nif it even has to be addressed,\nit's an extremely broad spectrum\nand a lot of times,\nand I understand the representatives concerned,\na lot of times that communication is open\nand encouraged by the guardian of the individual.\nAnd so if we break it down to say email and all this other kind of stuff what we're really doing is we're taking the cake and just slicing it into pieces that they can already do all that but that where you're more detailed orders come from is when you're having to put prohibitions in there targeting particular individuals whose contact would not be conducive with the with the overall health of the individual trying to protect is that true.\nThat's true, but I guess the way I look at it,\nthis bill is attempting to address conduct\nby a guardian as opposed to third parties.\nSo what the focus is is if the guardian\nis prohibiting these communications,\nnot if other people are having these communications,\nwhat the court is trying to address most of the time\nis a guardian who is prohibiting communications.\nif there is a circumstance where there's a third party trying to have communications with the\nward, this is not appropriate, you know, our expectation is, is the guardian is there to protect\nthe ward. But in this, I guess in the similar vein, if the ward is allowing that communication,\nwe need to address that as well. There's no question about that. But I think this bill is more focused\non what is the guardian doing to prohibit these communications as opposed to what other people are\nare doing. Final question, Madam Chair. But is there anything in this bill that the court\ncould not do today? From my point of view, no, I think there was language in there about\nfinding someone. And I guess my feeling about that is if I think that a case is extreme enough\nthat I'm finding people I need to be removing people because to me that's that's a fairly significant step.\nI'm not sure you're looking at the most recent version of the bill because I think that was\nwhat line is that right and I think it's more discretionary now than it was before.\nor a question.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nNot limited to, right.\nOther questions for Judge Wood?\nWe'll work on those.\nYep.\nThank you, Madam Chair.\nSo just to, is there anything in this bill\nif we were to pass it that you think would undermine\nor be harmful?\nSo I know we've, we've adjust the other side of,\ndo you think that we need it?\nMm-hmm.\nBut is there anything about passing this bill\nthat would actually be hurtful or harmful?\nI don't think it to the extent that it does not limit anything that I can do,\nyou know, I don't have a problem with it in terms of is it going to affect my ability to protect\nawards interest? No, I just think that I think that, you know, it's a very well-intentioned\nidea. I think that we already just have that authority and you're just adding language to\nsomething that's already there. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Barnes. Thank you, Madam Chair.\nThis may be a question for the author, but I'll start with the judge. On line 10,\nthe word communicate freely and privately. Again, is already in code? Is that correct?\nOn line 10, section 1,\nUnicate freely and privately is already in code is that correct correct and so the remainder\nof the sentence that the additional language is an attempt. I think it's an attempt to define\nwhat communication means and I can communicate through these types of mechanisms,\nvisitation, bone calls, emails, and personments. Is that true? So we're trying to\ndefine what free communication is, is that author? Let's first let the representative answer.\nSo line 11 just gives examples of ways to communicate. But but interestingly enough,\nit seems to imply that this is an exhaustive list. So we're not talking about social media or\nor any kind of Facebook, Instagram, technology change because it's not email but I can use messaging\nor messaging services. My concern is if we codify those things over time, they will become obsolete.\nEven if you listen to them all out today, so if I consider and say, I want to add Facebook\nmessenger, for example, to that. It's not email. Or you know, I'm just saying my concern is not\nopposed to it, but is if you specify this, and you don't, I don't see where it says that this is\nthese are examples. Use the term through. I'll be, I'm just concerned that we would become\nI'm absolutely in a matter of years or less.\nThank you for that comment.\nI would be willing to include that word examples or for instance,\nif legislative council would be grateful to that or it's that.\nIt's in some way that we can change that.\nWe have another question. I'm going to wrap.\nI said rest rest rest.\nif including the wording, including through would be, so that's one word that we would add\nto that sentence. Because I can understand why you want to provide examples because\ncommunicating freely and privately would most naturally come across as communication,\nwhether it's written verbal, visitation is a word that sticks out there because that doesn't come\nnaturally like the word would be entitled to communicate through visitation. So I do appreciate\nthe fact that that is there because I don't think that that's a natural example that people would\nthink about, whereas communicate freely and privately through telephone, email, and personal mail\nmake sense. So I appreciate the fact that visitation is in there maybe by\nincluding the word including it makes it clear that that we're talking about\nexamples. Ms. Carter did you have comment on this? The easy fix at this point would\nbe including but not limited to that would be a legislative proper way to go\nwith that issue.\nSenator Payne, any questions?\nYes.\nThank you, Madam Chairman.\nThis is even out of that language, including but not limited to.\nI mean, that doesn't change the fact that it states communicate freely and privately with persons other than the Guardian.\nalready. And I mean, we're not really changing anything with this language, because my good friend\ndown there pointed out that, you know, if you start listing the ways that they can communicate,\nyou're putting, you're putting that communication that's supposed to be freely and privately in a box.\nAnd when you start putting that communication in a box of what that communication and how it can\nYou can come and win it, you can come.\nThen it's going quickly, not big,\nfree me and privately anymore.\nThat's my concern.\nOkay, I didn't hear a question there,\nbut I think there's a fair amount of questions\nabout the exact wording that's in the bill\nand the impact that it would have on with prevent judges do,\nwhich is why we're having hearing only.\nBut as you know, this is year one of a two year process\nAnd so I'm hopeful that you'll be able to work\nwith the probate judges and get this language very tight\nand bring it back to us.\nGreat.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nAnd we're adjourned.\nStraight away, sir.\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\nYou\n",
